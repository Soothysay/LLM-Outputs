   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage confirmed on bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Vasculitis is suspected,
   particularly a pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's (granulomas),
   Goodpasture's, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated
   acute renal failure. However, lower on the differential are ARDS, TRALI
   with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR. Pt currently clinically
   tachypneic. Received a dose of Cytoxan and Solumedrol at OSH, but
   unclear if Cytoxan was PO or IV, and if pt was dosed monthly or daily.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
   - CXR
s as needed
   - Type and screen, cross match x 2 units; threshold to transfuse hct
   <21, unless clinically unstable
   - Blood consent
   - Consult Renal and Rheum in a.m.
   - Will hold off on resuming Cytoxan for now as unclear what dose pt
   actually got at OSH. Will await Renal and Rheum recs. Pt may eventually
   get renal biopsy
   - Will continue Solumedrol 1g IV daily
   - F/u on Renal serology and BAL results from OSH
   - Will check Crits q8  for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Ddx includes most likely pulmonary renal
   syndromes, such as Wegener's (granulomas), Goodpasture's, microscopic
   polyangiitis, lupus, PAN. BUN/Cr on discharge was 126/9.6, K 5.8. Fits
   nicely into pulm-renal picture above. Nephritic picture with RBC casts.
   Denies epistaxis. However, apart from pulmonary association, ddx for
   acute renal failure with nephritis includes PSGN, lupus nephritis, etc.
   ESR elevated >140, consistent with an autoimmune disorder.
   Age-appropriate for Wegener's.  Also consider DIC.
   - F/u on u/a, urine lytes, urine sediment
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM, anti-DNA,
   cryglobulins, ANCA, HepB/C serology
   - Will re-check renal labs above here as well (C3, C4, etc.)
   - Consult Renal here
   - Foley in place
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Replete lytes PRN
   - Will check q8 lytes for now
   - Start Sevelemer in a.m. with meals for elevated Phos.
   .
   # Tachycardia: ?Aflutter on EKG at OSH. Also present in several limb
   leads on admission EKG here. Currently asymptomatic with rate in 120s.
   Can be secondary to underlying structural heart disease. Also may be
   secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body fluid with renal
   failure, with large volume load putting stress on atria.)
   - F/u on TSH
   - Surface ECHO in a.m. today
   - Starting Lopressor 12.5mg PO bid this a.m. for rate control.
   .
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   .
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
   - Check Crits q8
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   - Blood consent obtained
   .
   # FEN: Regular renal-cardiac diet for now. Will switch back to NPO if
   respiratory status worsens anticipating intubation. Will replete lytes
   PRN.  Kayexelate x 1 for high K, Sevelamer in a.m. for high phos.
   .
   # Access: 2 PIVs

   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
   .

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis and no other chronic medical problems. He presents with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. The patient's overnight events include increased oxygen requirement, atrial flutter with a stable heart rate, and elevated potassium levels. The patient received Kayexelate for the elevated potassium.

The physical examination findings include alertness, awake, and sitting up in bed eating breakfast. The patient is mildly tachypneic and has no abnormal findings in the genitourinary system. The cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. S1 and S2 are present. The lungs show rhonchi over the right lung fields posteriorly and crackles/rhonchi over the left lung fields posteriorly. The abdomen is soft with no palpable organs. There is hepatomegaly without splenomegaly. The extremities have 1+ pitting edema in the lower extremities bilaterally, along with diffuse macular rash from knees downwards (improved today, less erythematous), and no cyanosis or clubbing.

The laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (9.7) and blood urea nitrogen (147), indicating acute renal failure. The hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, leukocyte count is 7.4, and platelet count is 543. The electrolyte levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage confirmed on bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Vasculitis is suspected,
   particularly a pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's (granulomas),
   Goodpasture's, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated
   acute renal failure. However, lower on the differential are ARDS, TRALI
   with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR. Pt currently clinically
   tachypneic. Received a dose of Cytoxan and Solumedrol at OSH, but
   unclear if Cytoxan was PO or IV, and if pt was dosed monthly or daily.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
   - CXR
s as needed
   - Type and screen, cross match x 2 units; threshold to transfuse hct
   <21, unless clinically unstable
   - Blood consent
   - Consult Renal and Rheum in a.m.
   - Will hold off on resuming Cytoxan for now as unclear what dose pt
   actually got at OSH. Will await Renal and Rheum recs. Pt may eventually
   get renal biopsy
   - Will continue Solumedrol 1g IV daily
   - F/u on Renal serology and BAL results from OSH
   - Will check Crits q8  for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Ddx includes most likely pulmonary renal
   syndromes, such as Wegener's (granulomas), Goodpasture's, microscopic
   polyangiitis, lupus, PAN. BUN/Cr on discharge was 126/9.6, K 5.8. Fits
   nicely into pulm-renal picture above. Nephritic picture with RBC casts.
   Denies epistaxis. However, apart from pulmonary association, ddx for
   acute renal failure with nephritis includes PSGN, lupus nephritis, etc.
   ESR elevated >140, consistent with an autoimmune disorder.
   Age-appropriate for Wegener's.  Also consider DIC.
   - F/u on u/a, urine lytes, urine sediment
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM, anti-DNA,
   cryglobulins, ANCA, HepB/C serology
   - Will re-check renal labs above here as well (C3, C4, etc.)
   - Consult Renal here
   - Foley in place
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Replete lytes PRN
   - Will check q8 lytes for now
   - Start Sevelemer in a.m. with meals for elevated Phos.
   .
   # Tachycardia: ?Aflutter on EKG at OSH. Also present in several limb
   leads on admission EKG here. Currently asymptomatic with rate in 120s.
   Can be secondary to underlying structural heart disease. Also may be
   secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body fluid with renal
   failure, with large volume load putting stress on atria.)
   - Check TSH
   - Surface ECHO in a.m.
   - Will start Lopressor 12.5mg PO daily for rate control.
   .
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   .
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
   - Check Crits q8
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   - Blood consent obtained
   .
   # FEN: Regular renal-cardiac diet for now. Will switch back to NPO if
   respiratory status worsens anticipating intubation. Will replete lytes
   PRN.  Kayexelate x 1 for high K, Sevelamer in a.m. for high phos.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, presenting with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory distress, acute renal failure, tachycardia, anemia, and fluid overload. 

The respiratory distress is most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed on bronchoscopy. Vasculitis is suspected, particularly pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's granulomas, Goodpasture's, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated acute renal failure. Other possibilities include ARDS and TRALI with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR. 

The patient's acute renal failure is consistent with pulmonary-renal syndromes, but other causes such as PSGN, lupus nephritis, etc. should also be considered. Elevated ESR (>140) is consistent with an autoimmune disorder. 

Tachycardia may be secondary to atrial flutter or underlying structural heart disease, possibly related to large volume shifts due to renal failure. 

The patient's anemia is likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage and renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress requiring intubation, further deterioration of renal function, development of cardiac arrhythmias, and potential bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing supplemental O2 PRN, Albuterol nebs PR"

The patient also has acute renal failure with nephritic picture, elevated ESR, and RBC casts in the urine. Other possible causes of acute renal failure include PSGN, lupus nephritis, etc.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage leading to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Acute renal failure progressing to chronic renal failure.
3. Development of sepsis due to immunosuppression from vasculitis or renal failure.
4. Cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure due to fluid overload.
5. Anemia worsening and requiring transfusion support.
6. Infection complications due to immunosuppression and prolonged ICU stay.
7. Possible need for renal biopsy to determine the exact cause of renal failure.
8. Development of further systemic involvement of vasculitis if it is the underlying cause.
9. Metabolic imbalances such as electrolyte disturbances and hyperphosphatemia.

   Role of plasmapheresis without clear diagnosis is challenging. Will
   consult with Renal collegues on possibility of a renal biopsy to aid in
   diagnosis. Additionally he is moving towards dialysis, need to closely
   watch K, renally dose all meds.  His resp status is tenusous due to
   hypoxemia as well as met acidosis and uremic encephalopathy- may
   require intubation for support
 would likely favor this over NIPPV
   given likely duration.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of former tobacco use and nephrolithiasis. He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of shortness of breath and edema for 2-3 weeks. The patient was found to have a hematocrit level of 14.1%, acute renal failure with red blood cell casts and proteinuria, an elevated ESR of more than 140, and alveolar hemorrhage on bronchoalveolar lavage. He has been started on 1 g of solumedrol and cytoxan 120 mg, and is being considered for plasmapheresis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.5°C (95.9°F), a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 140/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 4 L. The patient appears to be in no acute distress but is tachypneic. Physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lungs, a distant S2 heart sound, and the presence of petechiae at the feet with a maculopapular rash that is resolving. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and is oriented to time, place, and person.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of former tobacco use and nephrolithiasis. He was transferred from another hospital due to shortness of breath, edema, and alveolar hemorrhage. The patient's current symptoms include fatigue, tachycardia, cough, nausea, anemia, and a diffuse maculopapular rash. His vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, low oxygen saturation, and fever. Laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury, anemia, elevated creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Imaging shows diffuse bilateral opacities in the lungs. The patient has been started on high-dose steroids and cyclophosphamide for pulmonary-renal syndrome. Further tests are pending, including ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies, and renal biopsy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary-renal syndrome: The patient's symptoms of alveolar hemorrhage, renal failure, and the presence of RBC casts in urine suggest this diagnosis. If left untreated, it can lead to worsening respiratory distress and end-stage renal disease.

2. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia. If not properly managed, it can result in decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and worsen fatigue and shortness of breath.

3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and acute kidney injury indicate renal dysfunction. If"

   60 yr old man with subacute lethargy x weeks tx from OSH with pulmonary

   Agree with plan for empiric Rx with Solumedrol at 1 GM and Cytoxan.
   Role of plasmapheresis without clear diagnosis is challenging. Will
   consult with Renal collegues on possibility of a renal biopsy to aid in
   diagnosis. Additionally he is moving towards dialysis, need to closely
   watch K, renally dose all meds.  His resp status is tenusous due to
   hypoxemia as well as met acidosis and uremic encephalopathy- may
   require intubation for support
 would likely favor this over NIPPV
   given likely duration.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of former tobacco use and nephrolithiasis. He was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath and edema for 2-3 weeks. Upon evaluation, he was found to have anemia, acute renal failure, red blood cell casts in urine, elevated ESR, and alveolar hemorrhage on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

The patient has been started on solumedrol (1 g daily) and cytoxan (120 mg) for the treatment of pulmonary-renal syndrome. His current conditions include pulmonary-renal syndrome, anemia, renal failure, and atrial flutter. The possible differential diagnoses for his condition include Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Goodpasture's syndrome, lupus, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient is currently stable, with vital signs showing tachycardia and hypoxemia. His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal diffuse bilateral opacities with alveolar and interstitial components on chest X-ray.

The patient's plan includes further testing such as ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies, thyroid function tests, and various serological markers. Ren"

   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to alveolar hemorrhage.  Monotor
   SaO2.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, attributed to Pulmonary-Renal syndrome.  Renal
   consult prepared to move to dialysis when indicated.  Monitor urine
   output, BUN, Creatitine.
   PULMONARY-RENAL SYNDROME -- evaluation and diagnostics pending.
   Continue steroids and plasmaphoresis.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- iv replacement Rx, consider constant infusion.
   FLUIDS -- limit iv fluids intake.
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA -- start phosphate binder.
   NUTRITION -- NPO pending evaluation
   ANEMIA -- progressive, attributed to underlying process, and possible

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with Pulmonary-Renal syndrome. He presents with respiratory distress and hypoxemia, attributed to acidemia (renal failure) and hypoxemia in the setting of pulmonary infiltrates. The patient has diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates, predominantly basilar, which are attributed to alveolar hemorrhage.

The patient is currently on corticosteroids and plasmaphoresis for Pulmonary-Renal syndrome. He remains non-oliguric and requires oxygen support. A renal biopsy is planned for today. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory distress/hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a compromised respiratory system. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in respiratory failure.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure attributed to Pulmonary-Renal syndrome. This can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly, leading to the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation.

3. Pulmonary infiltrates: The presence of diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates suggests alveolar hemorrhage. If left untreated, this can worsen the respiratory distress and increase the risk of secondary infections.

4. Anemia: The patient has progressive anemia, which can contribute to further respiratory distress and compromised oxygen delivery to tissues.

5. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient"

   diffuse infiltrates and oxygen requirement.
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to pulmonary infiltrates.  Monitor SaO2,
   supplimental O2 to maintain SaO2 >90%.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- attributed to alveolar hemorrhage.  Monotor
   SaO2.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, attributed to Pulmonary-Renal syndrome.  Renal
   consult prepared to move to dialysis when indicated.  Monitor urine
   output, BUN, Creatitine.
   PULMONARY-RENAL SYNDROME -- evaluation and diagnostics pending.
   Continue steroids and plasmaphoresis.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- iv replacement Rx, consider constant infusion.
   FLUIDS -- limit iv fluids intake.
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA -- start phosphate binder.
   NUTRITION -- NPO pending evaluation
   ANEMIA -- progressive, attributed to underlying process, and possible
   contribution from RIJ central line placement.  Transfuse to Hct >21.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a diagnosis of Pulmonary-Renal syndrome. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient remains on corticosteroids and plasmaphoresis, which were initiated last night via a newly placed dialysis catheter. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising levels of BUN and creatinine.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates and oxygen requirement suggest the possibility of ARDS, which is a severe form of lung inflammation that can lead to respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of pulmonary infiltrates, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which is a life-threatening response to infection.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The progressive increase in BUN and creatinine levels indicates worsening renal function. If not addressed promptly, AKI can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

4. Bleeding Disorders: The patient's anemia and possible contribution from the right internal jugular (RIJ) central line placement may indicate a bleeding disorder. This could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombocytopenia, both of which can occur in critically"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory distress: Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage confirmed on bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Vasculitis is suspected,
   particularly a pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's (granulomas),
   Goodpasture's, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated
   acute renal failure. However, lower on the differential are ARDS, TRALI
   with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR. Pt currently clinically
   tachypneic. Received a dose of Cytoxan and Solumedrol at OSH, but
   unclear if Cytoxan was PO or IV, and if pt was dosed monthly or daily.
   - follow HCT q6h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.  Concern given
   recent HCT drop.   Transfusion threshold is HCT<21
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Figure out exact 02 requirement (patient on facemask, not always
   wearing it)
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
   - repeat CXR
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
   - Continue to keep patient NPO due to tentative respiratory status (and
   renal biopsy).
   (see t'ment plan for presumed Wegener's under acute renal failure)
   # Acute renal failure: Ddx includes most likely pulmonary renal
   syndromes, such as Wegener's (granulomas), Goodpasture's, microscopic
   polyangiitis, lupus, PAN. BUN/Cr on was 126/9.6, K 5.8. Nephritic
   picture with RBC casts. However, apart from pulmonary association, ddx
   for acute renal failure with nephritis includes PSGN, lupus nephritis,
   etc. ESR elevated >140, consistent with an autoimmune disorder.
   Age-appropriate for Wegener's.  Also consider DIC.
   - Renal biopsy today, FFP on call due to INR 1.5
   - For presumed Wegeners, started Plasmapheresis (firs tt'ment  last
   night, will be QOD x 5 treatments)
   - Continue Solumedrol 1g IV daily
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM, anti-DNA,
   cryglobulins, ANCA, HepB/C serology
   - Will re-check renal labs above here as well (C3, C4, etc.)
   - Foley in place
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Replete lytes PRN
   - Will check q8 lytes for now
   - Continue  Sevelemer in a.m. with meals for elevated Phos.
    - Renal c/s recommends also starting Amphagel (phosphate binder) 30cc
   po tid for 2-3 days for elevated Phos.
   #Hypernatremia: NA+ today 150, up from 147, likely [**12-29**] lack of access
   to free water
   -Replace w/ D5NS
   #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (uses citrate which acts as Ca2+
   binder)
   -Replace Ca2+
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG.  Until yesterday, was asymptomatic but
   rate in 120s. Can be secondary to underlying structural heart disease.
   Also may be secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - F/u on TSH
   - TTE today
   - Lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control (HR in
   80s).
   .
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   .
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
   - Check HCT q6
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   - Blood consent obtained
   .
   # FEN: NPO for worsening respiratory status, anticipating intubation.
   Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: 2 PIVs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, presenting with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. He has been in the ICU for respiratory distress, which is suspected to be caused by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed through bronchoscopy. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, with a tentative diagnosis of a pulmonary-renal syndrome such as Wegener's granulomatosis, Goodpasture's syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, or PAN. Other possible causes include ARDS, TRALI, and nephritic syndrome. The patient has been given Cytoxan and Solumedrol, and plasmapheresis has been initiated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory distress and alveolar hemorrhage increase the risk of further pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen, leading to the need for dialysis or potentially chronic kidney disease.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial flutter may progress to atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias, which could lead to hemodynamic instability.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
   # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L w/ humidification, 93-98%.  Most
   likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed on
   bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Vasculitis is suspected, particularly a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's (granulomas), Goodpasture's,
   microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated acute renal
   failure. However, lower on the differential are ARDS, TRALI with
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR. Pt currently clinically
   tachypneic. Received a dose of Cytoxan and Solumedrol at OSH, but
   unclear if Cytoxan was PO or IV, and if pt was dosed monthly or daily.
    - follow HCT q6h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.  HCT continues to
   slowly drop, likely a slow bleed.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
   - Patient now tolerating PO, though still concern for respiratory
   status
    - treating treating the underlying disease (presumed Wegener's):
    -Plasmapheresis, dose [**1-1**] today (QOD)
    -Solumedrol 1g IV daily (will change to prednisone tomorrow per
   rheumatology)
    -Cyclophosphamide 140mg w/mesna for cystitis prophylaxis
   # Acute renal failure: Monitoring for need for dialysis, has line just
   in case.  Creatinine down to 7.6, BUN up to 155.  No signs of platelet
   dysfunction yet, mental status ok.  BUN continues to increase, but BUN
   often stays elevated in acute renal failure after the kidneys have
   started to improve, also the patient is on high dose steroids which can
   increase BUN.  As a note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners
   has been shown to improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - Renal biopsy yesterday, awaiting results.  Monitor for bleeding at
   site given possible platelet dysfunction.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4-negative, Hep C VL
   negative, pending: [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM, anti-DNA, cryglobulins, ANCA, HepB
   serology
   - Will re-check renal labs above here as well (C3, C4, etc.)
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes .  Will try to maintain
   100cc/hr urine output for prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis.
   -On Sevelamer, Amphagel (day [**12-30**]) for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          D/C Bactrim due to renal function, patient should be
   discharged on Atovaqone.
   #Hypernatremia:likely secondary to lack of access to water,on D5W NA+
   today 141, down from 150.
   -Now patient is taking PO, D/C D5W.
   -if needed, restart fluids to maintain UOP 100cc/hr (to prevent hem.
   cystitis while on cytoxan)
   #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (uses citrate which acts as Ca2+
   binder)
   -Replace Ca2+ (given 4g this am),
   -lytes q6hrs
   -EKG
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG.  Asymptomatic, rate well controlled
   overnight. ECHO yesterday showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
    - Check HCT q6
   - given HCT [**Last Name (LF) 4198**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give 1unit today
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   -          Blood consent obtained
   -          Guaiac all stools
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: 2 PIVs
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])
   # Dispo: ICU at least overnight for close monitoring of hemodynamic and
   pulmonary status.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, presenting with symptoms of anemia, hypoxia, bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage, and acute renal failure. The patient is being treated for presumed Wegener's disease. 

The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, requiring an increased amount of oxygen to maintain an oxygen saturation above 90%. He is also experiencing tachypnea and has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed on bronchoscopy. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary-renal syndrome, ARDS, and TRALI. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels and acute renal failure. A renal biopsy was performed yesterday, and results are pending. The underlying cause of the renal failure is suspected to be Wegener's disease. 

The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5W and now PO fluids. 

The patient is also experiencing hypocalcemia, which is being treated with calcium replacement and monitoring of electrolytes. 

The patient is in atrial flutter with a controlled heart rate and an ECHO showing mild LV septal dysfunction. 

The patient has lower extremity edema, likely secondary to renal failure. 

The patient has anemia, which is believed to be secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage and chronic inflammatory disease.

   - follow HCT q6h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.  HCT continues to
   slowly drop, likely a slow bleed.   Transfusion threshold is HCT<21
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
   - CXR
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
   - Patient now tolerating PO, though still concern for respiratory

   - also treating the underlying disease (presumed Wegener's):
    -Plasmapheresis, dose [**1-1**] today (QOD)
    -Solumedrol 1g IV daily

   # Acute renal failure: Monitoring for need for dialysis, has line just

   Ddx includes most likely pulmonary renal syndromes, such as Wegener's
   (granulomas), Goodpasture's, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN.
   BUN/Cr on was 126/9.6, K 5.8. Nephritic picture with RBC casts.
   However, apart from pulmonary association, ddx for acute renal failure
   with nephritis includes PSGN, lupus nephritis, etc. ESR elevated >140,
   consistent with an autoimmune disorder. Age-appropriate for Wegener's.
   Also consider DIC.
   - Renal biopsy yesterday, awaiting results
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4-negative, Hep C VL

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, presenting with symptoms of anemia, hypoxia, bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage, and acute renal failure. The patient is being treated for presumed Wegeners.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and has diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed on bronchoscopy. The respiratory distress is most likely secondary to the pulmonary hemorrhage. Vasculitis, particularly pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g., Wegener's, Goodpasture's, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN), is suspected. Other possibilities include ARDS and TRALI with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 7.6 and BUN of 155. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary renal syndromes such as Wegener's, Goodpasture's, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN, as well as PSGN, lupus nephritis, etc. The patient has RBC casts and an elevated ESR (>140) consistent with an autoimmune disorder.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 141, likely secondary to lack of access to water. The patient is now eating and can discontinue D5W.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L w/ humidification, 93-98%
   Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed on
   bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Vasculitis is suspected, particularly a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's (granulomas), Goodpasture's,
   microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated acute renal
   failure. However, lower on the differential are ARDS, TRALI with
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR. Pt currently clinically
   tachypneic. Received a dose of Cytoxan and Solumedrol at OSH, but
   unclear if Cytoxan was PO or IV, and if pt was dosed monthly or daily.
   - follow HCT q6h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.  HCT continues to
   slowly drop, likely a slow bleed.   Transfusion threshold is HCT<21
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
   - CXR
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
   - Patient now tolerating PO, though still concern for respiratory
   status
   - also treating the underlying disease (presumed Wegener's):
    -Plasmapheresis, dose [**1-1**] today (QOD)
    -Solumedrol 1g IV daily
    -Cyclophosphamide 140mg
   # Acute renal failure: Monitoring for need for dialysis, has line just
   in case.  Creatinine down to 7.6, BUN up to 155.  No signs of platelet
   dysfunction yet, mental status ok.
   Ddx includes most likely pulmonary renal syndromes, such as Wegener's
   (granulomas), Goodpasture's, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN.
   BUN/Cr on was 126/9.6, K 5.8. Nephritic picture with RBC casts.
   However, apart from pulmonary association, ddx for acute renal failure
   with nephritis includes PSGN, lupus nephritis, etc. ESR elevated >140,
   consistent with an autoimmune disorder. Age-appropriate for Wegener's.
   Also consider DIC.
   - Renal biopsy yesterday, awaiting results
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4-negative, Hep C VL
   negative, pending: [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM, anti-DNA, cryglobulins, ANCA, HepB
   serology
   - Will re-check renal labs above here as well (C3, C4, etc.)
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes
   -On Sevelamer, Amphagel (day [**12-30**]) for hyperphos
    - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   #Hypernatremia:likely secondary to lack of access to water,on D5W NA+
   today 141, down from 150.
   -Now patient is eating, can D/C D5W.
   #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (uses citrate which acts as Ca2+
   binder)
   -Replace Ca2+ (given 4g this am), check again this PM
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG.  Asymptomatic, rate well controlled
   overnight. ECHO yesterday showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
    - Check HCT q6, given HCT [**Last Name (LF) 4198**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] likely need blood this pm.
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
    - Blood consent obtained
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: 2 PIVs
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])
   # Dispo: ICU at least overnight for close monitoring of hemodynamic and
   pulmonary status.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary-renal syndrome, likely either Wegener's Granulomatosis or Goodpasture's Syndrome. The patient is receiving treatment with steroids and cytoxan, and plasmaphoresis has been initiated empirically. The patient also has respiratory distress due to diffuse parenchymal infiltrates attributed to hemorrhage. Renal failure is present, with non-oliguric urine output and gradually improving creatinine levels. Nutritional support has been advanced to promote oral intake, and fluids are being provided to maintain adequate urine output. Hyperglycemia is being monitored due to steroid use, and atrial flutter is well controlled with medication. Anemia is slowly reducing, likely due to blood loss from pulmonary hemorrhage and renal biopsy. The patient requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient's respiratory distress may be attributed to pulmonary hemorrhage, which can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potential respiratory failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to non-oliguric urine output and elevated creatinine levels. This may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Infection: Critically ill patients are at increased risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). Close"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. They have been diagnosed with probable Wegener's Granulomatosis or Goodpasture syndrome, which is a type of pulmonary-renal syndrome. The patient is experiencing diffuse parenchymal infiltrates attributed to hemorrhage, renal failure, anemia, hyperglycemia, and atrial flutter. The patient's condition has not shown significant change, but they are receiving appropriate medical interventions such as steroids, cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, and dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications:
- Diffuse bilateral infiltrates may indicate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pulmonary edema.
- Hemorrhage in the lungs could lead to worsening respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Renal Complications:
- Renal failure is present, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and non-oliguric urine output.
- The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and further interventions like dialysis may be required.

3. Hematological Complications:
- Anemia is present, and the patient may require blood transfusions to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

4. Endocrine Complications:
- Hyperglycemia is observed, which could be promoted by steroid use.
- Blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored, and insulin therapy or other antidiabetic medications might be necessary.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. 

1. Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome: The patient has a probable diagnosis of Wegener's Granulomatosis or Goodpasture's Syndrome. Treatment includes steroids, cytoxan, and plasmaphoresis.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient has diffuse parenchymal infiltrates attributed to hemorrhage. Monitoring respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SaO2), and chest X-ray (CXR) is recommended.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing non-oliguric renal failure with gradually improving creatinine levels. Monitoring blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and urine output (UO) is advised.

4. Nutritional Support: The patient's nutritional status should be advanced to include oral intake.

5. Fluids: Adequate urine output should be maintained, especially considering the patient is receiving cytoxan.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels are likely due to steroid use. Glycemic control should be promoted.

7. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter with good rate control. Medications for rate control should be continued.

8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is slowly reducing, and transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin level of >21 is recommended.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires close monitoring and management of nutrition,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 40% Fio2 facemask,
   93-98%.  Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed
   on bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Vasculitis is suspected, particularly a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's (granulomas), Goodpasture's,
   microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated acute renal
   failure. However, lower on the differential are ARDS, TRALI with
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR. Pt currently clinically
   tachypneic.
    - follow HCT q6h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.  HCT continues to
   slowly drop, but increased with 1unit yesterday.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
    - Patient now tolerating PO, though still concern for respiratory
   status
    - treating treating the underlying disease (presumed Wegener's):
   -Plasmapheresis, dose [**1-1**] yesterday (QOD)
   -Solumedrol 1g IV daily, will ask Rheumatology for recommended
   prednisone dose
   -Cyclophosphamide 140mg w/mesna for cystitis prophylaxis, has had 4
   doses thus far.
   # Acute renal failure: Monitoring for need for dialysis, has line just
   in case.  Creatinine down to 7 down to 7.1.  BUN peaked at 160 now,
   149.  No signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status ok.  Renal
   will give his kidneys about 48 more hours to turn around before
   dialyzing.  As a note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has
   been shown to improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
    - Renal biopsy yesterday: per renal, patient with cresenteric
   glomerulosclerosis but more cellular glomeruli than sclerotic giving
   hope for return on.  Monitor for bleeding at site given possible
   platelet dysfunction.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4-negative, Hep C VL
   negative, Hep B negative. pending: [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM, anti-DNA,
   cryglobulins, ANCA.
   - Will re-check renal labs above here as well (C3, C4, etc.)
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes .  Requiring 1/2NS @ 150 to
   maintain 100cc/hr urine output for prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis.
    -On Sevelamer, Amphagel (day [**1-28**]) for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          D/C Bactrim yesterday due to renal function, patient now on
   Atovaqone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**].
   #Hypernatremia:likely secondary to lack of access to water,resolved
   yesterday with D51/2.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (uses citrate which acts as Ca2+
   binder)
   -given 6g IV Ca yesterday, plus more during pheresis
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG.  Asymptomatic, rate well controlled
   overnight. ECHO yesterday showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
    - Check HCT q6
   - given HCT trend, gave 1 unit yesterday with improved HCT.
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   -          Blood consent obtained
   -          Guaiac all stools
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: 2 PIVs
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])
   # Dispo: ICU at least overnight for close monitoring of hemodynamic and
   pulmonary status.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 40% Fio2 facemask,
   90-98%.  Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed
   on bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Vasculitis is suspected, particularly a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's (granulomas), Goodpasture's,
   microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated acute renal
   failure. However, lower on the differential are ARDS, TRALI with
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR.
    - follow HCT q8h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.  HCT responded
   appropriately to 1unit PRBCs so likely not currently bleeding.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
    - Patient now tolerating PO, though still concern for respiratory
   status
    - treating treating the underlying disease (presumed Wegener's):
   -Plasmapheresis, dose [**1-1**] yesterday (QOD)
   -Prednison po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-dose to be determined after c/s with rheum and
   renal.  Will give mesna for cystitis prophylaxis, has had 4 doses thus
   far.
   -affrin nasal spray day [**11-29**] for nasal congestion
   # Acute renal failure: Monitoring for need for dialysis, has line in
   case.  Creatinine down down to 7.1.  BUN peaked at 160 now, 149.  No
   signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status ok.  Renal will give
   his kidneys about 48 more hours to turn around before dialyzing.  As a
   note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to
   improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
    - Renal biopsy yesterday: per renal, patient with cresenteric
   glomerulosclerosis but more cellular glomeruli than sclerotic giving
   hope for return on.  Monitor for bleeding at site given possible
   platelet dysfunction.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4-negative, Hep C VL
   negative, Hep B negative. pending: [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM, anti-DNA,
   cryglobulins, ANCA.
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes .  Requiring 1/2NS @ 150 to
   maintain 100cc/hr urine output for prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis.
   -pink tinged urine, stable, but will send daily U/As.
    -On Sevelamer, Amphagel (today is day [**1-28**]) for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          D/C Bactrim yesterday due to renal function, patient now on
   Atovaqone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**].
   #Hypernatremia:likely secondary to lack of access to water,resolved
   with D51/2.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -given 16 IV Ca in the last 24 hours, ionized Ca now WNL.
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG.  Asymptomatic, rate well controlled
   overnight. ECHO yesterday showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
    - Check HCT q8
   - will transfuse for HCT<21 or symptomatic anemia
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   -          Blood consent obtained
   -          Stool guaiacc negative today, continue to check.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: 2 PIVs
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])
   # Dispo: ICU at least overnight for close monitoring of hemodynamic and
   pulmonary status.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hemorrhage, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, and renal biopsy consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis. The patient has been receiving plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, and solute medrom. He is also on IV fluids to maintain urine output above 100 cc/hr and tolerating oral intake. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient requires supplemental oxygen due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed on bronchoscopy. The underlying cause may be vasculitis, particularly pulmonary-renal syndrome such as Wegener's granulomatosis. Other possibilities include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI).

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis and presents with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. The cause of ARF may be due to vasculitis affecting the kidneys, specifically Wegener's granulomatosis. Monitoring for the need for dialysis is important, and the patient has a line in place for this purpose. Renal biopsy shows crescentic glomerulosclerosis, indicating damage to the kidneys.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely"

The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring of his hemodynamic and pulmonary status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed on bronchoscopy. This is likely secondary to vasculitis, particularly Wegener's granulomatosis. Continuous supplemental oxygen is being provided to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. There is a concern for the need for dialysis if renal function does not improve within the next 48 hours. Plasmapheresis is being used to treat the underlying disease (presumed Wegener's).

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage, chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels is recommended, and blood transfusion may be necessary.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia likely due to lack of access to water, which has been resolved with D51/2.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 40% Fio2 facemask,
   93-98%.  Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed
   on bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Vasculitis is suspected, particularly a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's (granulomas), Goodpasture's,
   microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated acute renal
   failure. However, lower on the differential are ARDS, TRALI with
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR. Pt currently clinically
   tachypneic.
    - follow HCT q6h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.  HCT continues to
   slowly drop, but increased with 1unit yesterday.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
    - Patient now tolerating PO, though still concern for respiratory
   status
    - treating treating the underlying disease (presumed Wegener's):
   -Plasmapheresis, dose [**1-1**] yesterday (QOD)
   -Solumedrol 1g IV daily, will ask Rheumatology for recommended
   prednisone dose
   -Cyclophosphamide 140mg w/mesna for cystitis prophylaxis, has had 4
   doses thus far.
   # Acute renal failure: Monitoring for need for dialysis, has line just
   in case.  Creatinine down to 7 down to 7.1.  BUN peaked at 160 now,
   149.  No signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status ok.  Renal
   will give his kidneys about 48 more hours to turn around before
   dialyzing.  As a note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has
   been shown to improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
    - Renal biopsy yesterday: per renal, patient with cresenteric
   glomerulosclerosis but more cellular glomeruli than sclerotic giving
   hope for return on.  Monitor for bleeding at site given possible
   platelet dysfunction.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4-negative, Hep C VL
   negative, Hep B negative. pending: [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM, anti-DNA,
   cryglobulins, ANCA.
   - Will re-check renal labs above here as well (C3, C4, etc.)
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes .  Requiring 1/2NS @ 150 to
   maintain 100cc/hr urine output for prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis.
    -On Sevelamer, Amphagel (day [**1-28**]) for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          D/C Bactrim yesterday due to renal function, patient now on
   Atovaqone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**].
   #Hypernatremia:likely secondary to lack of access to water,resolved
   yesterday with D51/2.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (uses citrate which acts as Ca2+
   binder)
   -given 6g IV Ca yesterday, plus more during pheresis
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG.  Asymptomatic, rate well controlled
   overnight. ECHO yesterday showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
    - Check HCT q6
   - given HCT trend, gave 1 unit yesterday with improved HCT.
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   -          Blood consent obtained
   -          Guaiac all stools
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: 2 PIVs
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])
   # Dispo: ICU at least overnight for close monitoring of hemodynamic and
   pulmonary status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hemorrhage, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, and a renal biopsy confirming Wegener's granulomatosis.
- The patient required 6 liters of oxygen with 40% FiO2 via facemask to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
- The patient received plasmapheresis, Solu-Medrol, and cyclophosphamide as treatment for Wegener's.
- The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed on bronchoscopy.
- The patient's acute renal failure is being monitored, with a focus on maintaining urine output and avoiding dialysis for now.
- Renal biopsy showed crescentic glomerulosclerosis with cellular glomeruli, indicating potential recovery.
- The patient's anemia is likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage, chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
- Other medical complications include hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, tachycardia, left ventricular hypertrophy, and lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: This is a serious complication that can lead to respiratory distress and failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Anemia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a diagnosis of Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome, specifically Wegener's Granulomatosis. They are experiencing respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on high FiO2 requirement. Renal biopsy results confirm the diagnosis of Wegener's Granulomatosis. The patient has been receiving treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide (cytoxan), as well as plasmapheresis every other day. Other medical conditions present include anemia, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient also exhibits nasal congestion, which may be related to Wegener's or the high flow oxygen therapy. Additionally, the patient has hypocalcemia, which has been repleted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to diffuse alveolar infiltrates caused by vasculitis associated with Wegener's Granulomatosis. Monitoring the patient's respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) is crucial.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may progress if the underlying vasculitis is not effectively managed. Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting treatment accordingly is essential.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia could further deteriorate due to ongoing blood loss from alveolar hemorrhage, renal biopsy, and dysfunctional platelets. Regular monitoring of hematocrit (H"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a confirmed diagnosis of Wegener's Granulomatosis, a type of Pulmonary-Renal syndrome. The patient presents with respiratory distress and hypoxemia, requiring high FiO2 requirements. Renal biopsy is consistent with Wegener's Granulomatosis. The patient has been receiving treatment including steroids, cytoxan, and plasmaphoresis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/72 mmHg to 127/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

The physical examination reveals diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray, without significant change over the past few days. The patient has trace edema in both extremities, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 221 K/uL, and elevated platelet count of 355 K/uL. Renal function tests indicate renal failure, with serum creatinine levels ranging from 8.5 to 7.2 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 40% Fio2 facemask,
   90-98%.  Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed
   on bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Vasculitis is suspected, particularly a
   pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g. Wegener's (granulomas), Goodpasture's,
   microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN) given associated acute renal
   failure. However, lower on the differential are ARDS, TRALI with
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR.
    - follow HCT q8h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.  HCT responded
   appropriately to 1unit PRBCs so likely not currently bleeding.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
    - Patient now tolerating PO, though still concern for respiratory
   status
    - treating treating the underlying disease (presumed Wegener's):
   -Plasmapheresis, dose [**1-1**] yesterday (QOD)
   -Prednison po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-dose to be determined after c/s with rheum and
   renal.  Will give mesna for cystitis prophylaxis, has had 4 doses thus
   far.
   -affrin nasal spray day [**11-29**] for nasal congestion
   # Acute renal failure: Monitoring for need for dialysis, has line in
   case.  Creatinine down down to 7.1.  BUN peaked at 160 now, 149.  No
   signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status ok.  Renal will give
   his kidneys about 48 more hours to turn around before dialyzing.  As a
   note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to
   improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
    - Renal biopsy yesterday: per renal, patient with cresenteric
   glomerulosclerosis but more cellular glomeruli than sclerotic giving
   hope for return on.  Monitor for bleeding at site given possible
   platelet dysfunction.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4-negative, Hep C VL
   negative, Hep B negative. pending: [**Doctor First Name 1205**], anti-GBM, anti-DNA,
   cryglobulins, ANCA.
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes .  Requiring 1/2NS @ 150 to
   maintain 100cc/hr urine output for prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis.
   -pink tinged urine, stable, but will send daily U/As.
    -On Sevelamer, Amphagel (today is day [**1-28**]) for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          D/C Bactrim yesterday due to renal function, patient now on
   Atovaqone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**].
   #Hypernatremia:likely secondary to lack of access to water,resolved
   with D51/2.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -given 16 IV Ca in the last 24 hours, ionized Ca now WNL.
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG.  Asymptomatic, rate well controlled
   overnight. ECHO yesterday showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
    - Check HCT q8
   - will transfuse for HCT<21 or symptomatic anemia
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   -          Blood consent obtained
   -          Stool guaiacc negative today, continue to check.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: 2 PIVs
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])
   # Dispo: ICU at least overnight for close monitoring of hemodynamic and
   pulmonary status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis and no other chronic medical problems. He presents with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress requiring 6L NC and 40% FiO2 facemask, with O2 sat ranging from 90-98%. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage has been confirmed on bronchoscopy, and vasculitis, particularly pulmonary-renal syndrome (e.g., Wegener's, Goodpasture's, microscopic polyangiitis, lupus, PAN), is suspected. However, other possibilities include ARDS and TRALI with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR.

The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and BUN. He is being closely monitored for signs of bleeding at the renal biopsy site, given possible platelet dysfunction. Plasmapheresis has been initiated to improve kidney outcomes in cases of severe Wegeners.

The patient also has anemia likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage, which may be related to chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Blood transfusion is planned for HCT<21 or symptomatic anemia.

Other medical complications include hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and tachycardia. The patient's hypernatremia was resolved with D51/2, and his ionized Ca"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 40% Fio2 facemask,
   90-98%.  Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed
   on bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Per rheumatology, C-anca is positive confirming
   the diagnosis of C-ANCA vasculitis.  This morning, he is increased work
   of breathing, with worsening lung exam and desating to the 70s without
   the facemask on.  This is unlikely due to hemorrhage as his crit has
   remained stable.  He is 2L fluid up in 24 hours and 6L up for his LOS,
   and chest Xray appears to have signs of pulmonary edema, making volume
   overload the most likely cause of worsening pulmonary status.
   -will D/C fluids, try Lasix 40IV x1.  We will balance maintaining urine
   output >100/hr for bladder protection with not giving too much Lasix
   due to renal failure.
   -Patients at Wegener
s are at increased risk for septal perforation.
   Will examine his septum today as this could worsen his repiratory
   status and make him feel nasal congestion (which he has been
   complaining of)
   -CT of sinus has been recommended, will consider when patient more
   stable.
    - HCT has been stable, follow HCT q8h to monitor for alveolar
   bleeding.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
    - Patient desats while eating, if he continues will make him NPO
    - treating the underlying disease-Wegeners:
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 3/7 today, will get [**3-4**] tomorrow, then next MWF.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-140 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  Will give
   mesna for cystitis prophylaxis
   -affrin nasal spray day [**12-30**] for nasal congestion
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  BUN still high
   but not increasing, no signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status
   okAs a note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown
   to improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
    - Renal biopsy: per renal, patient with cresenteric glomerulosclerosis
   but more cellular glomeruli than sclerotic giving hope for return on.
   Monitor for bleeding at site given possible platelet dysfunction.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4-negative, Hep C VL
   negative, Hep B negative. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]-, anti-GBM-, anti-DNA-, cryglobulins P,
   ANCA P.
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes .
   -pink tinged urine, stable.  Urine has been tinged [**12-29**] nephritic
   picture, but if worsening, concern for hemorrhagic cystitis. Will
   monitor for increasing blood in urine and can irrigate the bladder if
   hemorrhagic cystitis is suspected.
    -On Sevelamer, Amphagel (today is day [**1-28**]) for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
   #Hypernatremia:likely secondary to lack of access to water,resolved
   with D51/2.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -given 4gIV in last 24 hours.
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG, in and out of NSR this am.
   Asymptomatic, rate well controlled overnight. ECHO showed mild LV
   septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts
   (retaining total body fluid with renal failure, with large volume load
   putting stress on atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
    - Check HCT q8
   - will transfuse for HCT<21 or symptomatic anemia
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   -          Blood consent obtained
   -          Stool guaiac negative today, continue to check.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: Dialysis line in his neck, with pigtail.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])
   # Dispo: ICU at least overnight for close monitoring of hemodynamic and
   pulmonary status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a distant history of nephrolithiasis, presenting with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress requiring 6L NC and 40% FiO2 facemask, with oxygen saturation ranging from 90-98%.
- A bronchoscopy confirmed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and the patient's C-ANCA test was positive, confirming the diagnosis of C-ANCA vasculitis.
- The patient's work of breathing has increased, and he desaturated to the 70s without the facemask on, suggesting that volume overload may be the cause of his worsening pulmonary status.
- The patient is 2L fluid up in 24 hours and 6L up for his LOS, and chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema.
- The plan is to discontinue fluids, try Lasix 40 IV once, maintain urine output >100/hr for bladder protection, and consider a CT sinus when the patient is more stable.
- The patient is at an increased risk for septal perforation, so his septum will be examined today.
- Supplemental O2 will be continued PRN, maintaining O2 sat >90%, and albuterol nebs will be given PRN.
- CXR will be done daily, and follow-up on BAL results from OSH will be awaited.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with a diagnosis of Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome (Wegener's Granulomatosis). The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, hypoxemia, renal failure, and anemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires high FiO2 requirement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: Due to the patient's compromised respiratory function and prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): This is a type of pneumonia that occurs in patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation.
3. Barotrauma: The high pressures generated by mechanical ventilation can cause injury to the lungs, leading to barotrauma.
4. Pulmonary edema: Fluid accumulation in the lungs can occur due to cardiac dysfunction or fluid overload, which may worsen the patient's respiratory status.
5. Sepsis: With the patient's compromised immune system, there is a risk of developing sepsis, especially if an infection occurs.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal failure can progress to AKI, further compromising kidney function.
7. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium levels can lead to muscle cramps, tetany, or cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Malnutrition: Prolonged bed"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 40% Fio2 facemask,
   90-98%.  Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**]
   C-ANCA vasculitis. This morning, he breathing more easily, with stable
   lung exam though his CXR looks unchanged.  This is likely due to
   diuresis, as he is -2L in the past 24 hours.  Per nursing, he has new
   hemoptysis, unlclear if it is pink tinged or w/frank blood.  Also has
   2+ budding yeast on sputum, without signs of candidiasis on
   oropharyngeal exam.
   -Will give lasix 40IV for goal of -1-2 L today.  We will also watch his
   urine output and restart IVF if necessary. We will balance maintaining
   urine output >100/hr for bladder protection with not giving too much
   Lasix due to renal failure.
   -Patients at Wegener
s are at increased risk for septal perforation.
   His septum is intact this am.  Will continue to check daily.
   -Start nystatin mouthwash
   -Send blood cultures for fungus (though highly unlikely given pt. is
   afebrile, stable,  but he is on high dose immunosuppression)
   -CT of sinus has been recommended, but will not likely change
   management  so we will not order it at this time.
    - Given hemoptysis and drop in crit, some concern for pulmonary
   bleeding, though respiratory status improving.
   - HCTq8h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.
   - Will collect sputum to determine whether hemoptysis is tinged, bright
   red or just pink fronthy.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN  , some wheezing on exam today
    - CXR daily
     - treating the underlying disease-Wegeners:
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 4/7 today, then next MWF.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-140 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  Will give
   mesna for cystitis prophylaxis
   -affrin nasal spray day [**1-28**] for nasal congestion
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  BUN still high
   but not increasing, no signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status
   ok.  Urine is less pink that previously.  Renal function has been
   steadily improving, likely as a response to Wegeners treatment. As a
   note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to
   improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes.
   -pink tinged urine, improved. Will continue to monitor visually.  If
   worsening will get U/A.
    -On Sevelamer, for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
   #Hypernatremia:likely secondary to lack of access to water,resolved
   with D51/2.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG, in and out of NSR this am.
   Asymptomatic, rate well controlled overnight. ECHO showed mild LV
   septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts
   (retaining total body fluid with renal failure, with large volume load
   putting stress on atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage,  chronic
   inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   No baseline Crit available.
   -transfuse one unit this morning as HCT is trending down (21.6)
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   -          Blood consent obtained
   -          Stool guaiac negative yesterday, continue to check.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: Dialysis line in his neck, with pigtail.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
    # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis and no other chronic medical problems. He presents with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with C-ANCA vasculitis, which is a type of autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation and damage to blood vessels. He also has acute renal failure, confirmed with a renal biopsy, and is being treated with plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive medications such as prednisone and cyclophosphamide.

The patient's respiratory status has improved with the use of supplemental oxygen and albuterol nebs as needed. His creatinine levels are trending down, indicating improvement in renal function. However, he still has high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and his urine output needs to be closely monitored.

The patient has been prescribed antifungal medications due to the presence of budding yeast in his sputum. He is also at an increased risk for septal perforation, which is common in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. Daily checks of his septum will be performed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary bleeding: The patient's hemoptysis and drop in critical hemoglobin levels raise concerns for potential pulmonary bleeding. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and sputum production is essential.

2. Renal failure: Despite the improvement in creatinine levels, the patient's renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 40% Fio2 facemask,
   90-98%.  Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**]
   C-ANCA vasculitis. This morning, he breathing more easily, with stable
   lung exam though his CXR looks unchanged.  This is likely due to
   diuresis, as he is -2L in the past 24 hours.  Per nursing, he has new
   hemoptysis, unlclear if it is pink tinged or w/frank blood.  Also has
   2+ budding yeast on sputum, without signs of candidiasis on
   oropharyngeal exam.
   -Will give lasix 40IV for goal of -1-2 L today.  We will also watch his
   urine output and restart IVF if necessary. We will balance maintaining
   urine output >100/hr for bladder protection with not giving too much
   Lasix due to renal failure.
   -Patients at Wegener
s are at increased risk for septal perforation.
   His septum is intact this am.  Will continue to check daily.
   -Start nystatin mouthwash
   -Send blood cultures for fungus (though highly unlikely given pt. is
   afebrile, stable,  but he is on high dose immunosuppression)
   -CT of sinus has been recommended, but will not likely change
   management  so we will not order it at this time.
    - HCTq8h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.  Given
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
    - Patient desats while eating, if he continues will make him NPO
    - treating the underlying disease-Wegeners:
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 3/7 today, will get [**3-4**] tomorrow, then next MWF.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-140 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  Will give
   mesna for cystitis prophylaxis
   -affrin nasal spray day [**12-30**] for nasal congestion
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  BUN still high
   but not increasing, no signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status
   okAs a note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown
   to improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
    - Renal biopsy: per renal, patient with cresenteric glomerulosclerosis
   but more cellular glomeruli than sclerotic giving hope for return on.
   Monitor for bleeding at site given possible platelet dysfunction.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - F/u on pending renal labs from OSH -> C3/C4-negative, Hep C VL
   negative, Hep B negative. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]-, anti-GBM-, anti-DNA-, cryglobulins P,
   ANCA P.
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes .
   -pink tinged urine, stable.  Urine has been tinged [**12-29**] nephritic
   picture, but if worsening, concern for hemorrhagic cystitis. Will
   monitor for increasing blood in urine and can irrigate the bladder if
   hemorrhagic cystitis is suspected.
    -On Sevelamer, Amphagel (today is day [**1-28**]) for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
   #Hypernatremia:likely secondary to lack of access to water,resolved
   with D51/2.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -given 4gIV in last 24 hours.
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG, in and out of NSR this am.
   Asymptomatic, rate well controlled overnight. ECHO showed mild LV
   septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts
   (retaining total body fluid with renal failure, with large volume load
   putting stress on atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # LE edema: likely secondary to renal failure above. Would hold off on
   diuresis given ARF.
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage. Likely related to a
   combination of chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage. No baseline Crit available.
    - Check HCT q8
   - will transfuse for HCT<21 or symptomatic anemia
   - Type and screen, cross-matched
   -          Blood consent obtained
   -          Stool guaiac negative today, continue to check.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: Dialysis line in his neck, with pigtail.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a distant history of nephrolithiasis and no other chronic medical problems. He presents with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to C-ANCA vasculitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Septal perforation: As the patient has a history of Wegener's disease, he is at increased risk for septal perforation. The healthcare team will continue to check the integrity of his septum daily.

2. Fungal infection: Although the patient is currently afebrile and stable, being on high-dose immunosuppression puts him at risk for fungal infections. Blood cultures for fungus have been sent, and nystatin mouthwash has been started.

3. Bleeding: Due to the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and potential platelet dysfunction, the patient is at risk for bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding, especially at the site of renal biopsy, is essential.

4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is confirmed with a renal biopsy showing crescentic glomerulosclerosis. Monitoring for worsening renal function and managing fluid and electrolyte balance is crucial.

5. Hemorrhagic cystitis: As the patient is receiving cyclophosphamide, which can cause hemorrhagic cyst"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 40% Fio2 facemask,
   90-98%.  Most likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage confirmed
   on bronchoscopy [**7-6**]. Per rheumatology, C-anca is positive confirming
   the diagnosis of C-ANCA vasculitis.  This morning, he is increased work
   of breathing, with worsening lung exam and desating to the 70s without
   the facemask on.  This is unlikely due to hemorrhage as his crit has
   remained stable.  He is 2L fluid up in 24 hours and 6L up for his LOS,
   and chest Xray appears to have signs of pulmonary edema, making volume
   overload the most likely cause of worsening pulmonary status.
   -will D/C fluids, try Lasix 40IV x1.  We will balance maintaining urine
   output >100/hr for bladder protection with not giving too much Lasix
   due to renal failure.
   -Patients at Wegener
s are at increased risk for septal perforation.
   Will examine his septum today as this could worsen his repiratory
   status and make him feel nasal congestion (which he has been
   complaining of)
   -CT of sinus has been recommended, will consider when patient more
   stable.
    - HCT has been stable, follow HCT q8h to monitor for alveolar
   bleeding.
   - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   - F/u on BAL results from OSH
    - Patient desats while eating, if he continues will make him NPO
    - treating the underlying disease-Wegeners:
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 3/7 today, will get [**3-4**] tomorrow, then next MWF.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-140 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  Will give
   mesna for cystitis prophylaxis
   -affrin nasal spray day [**12-30**] for nasal congestion
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  BUN still high
   but not increasing, no signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status
   okAs a note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis and no other chronic medical problems. He presents with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and confirmed diagnosis of C-ANCA vasculitis. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening despite supplemental oxygen, indicating a possible complication of pulmonary edema. His renal function is stable with good urine output, but he still has elevated BUN levels. The patient is on plasmapheresis, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and mesna for prophylaxis against cystitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's worsening respiratory status and chest X-ray findings suggest pulmonary edema as a potential complication. This can be confirmed by further imaging and clinical assessment.
2. Renal Failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, which is a known complication of C-ANCA vasculitis. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting treatment accordingly is essential.
3. Bleeding: Given the patient's positive C-ANCA test and evidence of alveolar hemorrhage, there is a risk of bleeding. Monitoring for any signs of internal bleeding and adjusting treatment to prevent further bleeding episodes is necessary.
4. Septal Perforation: Patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (C-ANCA vasculitis) are at increased"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has been diagnosed with Wegener's Granulomatosis, also known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), which is a form of vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized blood vessels. The patient's symptoms include cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and renal failure. 

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 129/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on a face tent. The patient's physical examination reveals pale conjunctivae and diffuse wheezing on lung auscultation. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 185 K/uL, and renal impairment with a creatinine level of 6.1 mg/dL. Other laboratory values show electrolyte imbalances and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for Wegener's Granulomatosis with steroids, cyclophosphamide (cytoxan), plasmapheresis, and nutritional support through oral intake. The patient's renal failure is attributed to Wegener's Granulomatosis, and there is a need for close monitoring of fluid balance and ongoing dialysis considerations"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient experienced hemoptysis yesterday but appears more comfortable today with reduced dyspnea. The patient has a history of Wegener's granulomatosis, which is attributed to pulmonary-renal syndrome. The patient is currently receiving steroids, cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, and diuretics for renal failure. Hemoptysis is likely due to pulmonary hemorrhage, and the patient is being monitored for any escalation. Nutritional support is being provided through PO, and the patient has been transfused to maintain a higher hematocrit level due to anemia caused by pulmonary hemorrhage and bone marrow suppression. Fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a net negative fluid status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient's hemoptysis and respiratory distress may indicate ongoing pulmonary hemorrhage, which can lead to worsening respiratory function and potential respiratory failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's Wegener's granulomatosis has led to renal failure, which could progress further if not managed appropriately. This may result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is multifactorial, resulting from both pulmonary hemorrhage and bone marrow suppression. If not adequately managed, the patient may develop further complications associated with anemia, such as fatigue,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 80% Fio2 facemask, 90-98%.
   Continues to desat to 80s when mask comes off.  Most likely secondary
   to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis. This morning he
   looks mor comfortable though CXR looks unchanged.  This is likely due
   to 2 days of diuresis, as he is -2.5L in the past 24 hours and -6.5L in
   the last 3 days.  Urine output remains high.
    - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   -Will give lasix 40IV for goal of -500
1L today.  We will also watch
   his urine output and restart IVF if necessary to keep >100cc/hr
    -Patients at Wegener
s are at increased risk for septal perforation.
   His septum is intact this am.  Will continue to check daily.
    - HCT down today, unlikely due to alveolar imprroving respiratory
   status, no hemoptysis.  Continue to monitor
   - If possible Will collect sputum to determine whether hemoptysis is
   tinged, bright red or just pink fronthy.
   -Continue nystatin mouthwash for [**Female First Name (un) 188**]+ sputum, though no sign of
   thrush.
   -CT of sinus has been recommended, but will not likely change
   management  so we will not order it at this time.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
     - treating the underlying disease-Wegeners:
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 4/7 yesterday, then next MWF.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-125 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  No MESNA
   needed, will give po H20 before dose
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  BUN still high
   but not increasing, no signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status
   ok.  Urine is less pink that previously.  Renal function has been
   steadily improving, likely as a response to Wegeners treatment. As a
   note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to
   improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes.
   -pink tinged urine, improved. Will continue to monitor visually.  If
   worsening will get U/A.    It is also possible that his HCT is due to
   hemorrhagic cystitis given he is on cyclophosphamide,  though he has no
   signs of increasing hematuria at present.
    -On Sevelamer, for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
    -received 4IV CA last night
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Rate has been well controlled over the past 2 days.
   Asymptomatic, rate well controlled overnight. ECHO showed mild LV
   septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts
   (retaining total body fluid with renal failure, with large volume load
   putting stress on atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # Anemia: Low HCT originally due to pulmonary hemorrhage,  chronic
   inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   He received 1 unit yesterday and bumped appropriately but his HCT is
   down today.  HCT is likely due to fluid shifts with plasmapheresis.  He
   will not receive pheresis this weekend, so we can monitor to see if HCT
   stays stable.
   -q12 HCT, transfuse if <21
    - Type and screen, cross-matched
    -          Blood consent obtained
    -          Stool guaiac negative yesterday, continue to check.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: Dialysis line in his neck, with pigtail.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
    # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, presenting with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU and requires supplemental oxygen due to respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and is likely experiencing C-ANCA vasculitis. He is being treated with plasmapheresis, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient requires 6L NC and 80% Fio2 facemask, indicating severe respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and provision of supplemental oxygen as needed are essential to maintain an O2 sat >90%. The risk of further deterioration and potential need for mechanical ventilation should be closely monitored.

2. Septal Perforation: Patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (now known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis) are at increased risk for septal perforation. Daily assessment of the patient's nasal septum integrity is necessary to identify any signs of perforation.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has confirmed C-ANCA vasculitis with renal involvement, evidenced by acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function through regular assessment of serum creatinine and urine output is crucial. The patient's creatinine levels are trending down, indicating improving renal function, but ongoing monitoring is required.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of
   nephrolithiasis, no other chronic medical problems who presents with
   lower extremity edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 80% Fio2 facemask, 90-98%.
   Continues to desat to 80s when mask comes off.  Most likely secondary
   to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis. This morning he
   looks mor comfortable though CXR looks unchanged.  This is likely due
   to 2 days of diuresis, as he is -2L in the past 24 hours and -4L in the
   last 2 days.  Urine output remains high.
    - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   -Will give lasix 40IV for goal of -500 today.  We will also watch his
   urine output and restart IVF if necessary
    -Patients at Wegener
s are at increased risk for septal perforation.
   His septum is intact this am.  Will continue to check daily.
    - Stable crit and no more hemoptysis so pulmonary bleeding unlikely,
   - HCTq12h to monitor for alveolar bleeding.
   - If possible Will collect sputum to determine whether hemoptysis is
   tinged, bright red or just pink fronthy.
   -Continue nystatin mouthwash for [**Female First Name (un) 188**]+ sputum, though no sign of
   thrush.
   -CT of sinus has been recommended, but will not likely change
   management  so we will not order it at this time.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
     - treating the underlying disease-Wegeners:
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 4/7 yesterday, then next MWF.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-140 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  No MESNA
   needed, will give po H20 before dose
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  BUN still high
   but not increasing, no signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status
   ok.  Urine is less pink that previously.  Renal function has been
   steadily improving, likely as a response to Wegeners treatment. As a
   note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to
   improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's).
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes.
   -pink tinged urine, improved. Will continue to monitor visually.  If
   worsening will get U/A.
    -On Sevelamer, for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
    -received 4IV CA last night
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Aflutter on EKG, in and out of NSR this am.
   Asymptomatic, rate well controlled overnight. ECHO showed mild LV
   septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts
   (retaining total body fluid with renal failure, with large volume load
   putting stress on atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # Anemia: likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage,  chronic
   inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   No baseline Crit available.
   -q12 HCT, transfuse if <21
    - Type and screen, cross-matched
    -          Blood consent obtained
    -          Stool guaiac negative yesterday, continue to check.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: Dialysis line in his neck, with pigtail.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
    # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis and no other chronic medical problems. He presented with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) likely secondary to C-ANCA vasculitis. He is receiving supplemental oxygen and diuretics to manage his respiratory distress and fluid overload. The patient is also being treated for acute renal failure, which is likely due to C-ANCA vasculitis. His renal function has been improving with plasmapheresis and prednisone. Other medical issues include hypocalcemia, tachycardia, anemia, and a Foley catheter in place for urinary output monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary bleeding: The patient's condition may lead to further pulmonary bleeding due to the underlying C-ANCA vasculitis. This can manifest as hemoptysis or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
2. Renal dysfunction: Although the patient's renal function has improved, there is still a risk of acute renal failure due to ongoing inflammation or recurrence of vasculitis.
3. Septal perforation: Patients with C-ANCA vasculitis are at increased risk for septal perforation. Regular checks should be conducted to monitor the integrity of the nasal septum.
4. Infection: The patient's immunos"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with Wegener's Granulomatosis, which is causing pulmonary-renal syndrome. The patient's condition has shown slow improvement clinically and radiographically. 

The patient requires supplemental oxygen and desaturates with activity. Tolerating net diuresis, hemoptysis has resolved, and the patient reports feeling improved with decreased dyspnea. The patient is able to sleep somewhat better.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on multiple medications including steroids, cytoxan, and plasmaphoresis for Wegener's Granulomatosis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose levels, and lactic acid. The patient's platelet count, albumin, and calcium levels are within normal range.

The patient's imaging shows improvement in the right lung field on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress indicates a potential complication related to Wegener's Granulomatosis, which can cause inflammation and damage to the lungs.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a diagnosis of Wegener's Granulomatosis, which is a form of vasculitis affecting small blood vessels. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress, and they require supplemental oxygen. The patient's overall condition has shown improvement, with better sleep quality and reduced dyspnea.

The patient's vital signs indicate a stable condition, with normal temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate within acceptable ranges. Oxygen saturation is at 94%, which is slightly below the target of maintaining >90%. The patient's general appearance is unremarkable, with no signs of acute distress or discomfort.

Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular system, lymphatic system, or musculoskeletal system. Neurological examination shows normal tone and purposeful movements, indicating no paralysis or sedation. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels, indicating possible infection or kidney dysfunction. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient has a history of Wegener's Granulomatosis, which can cause pulmonary-renal syndrome. Wegener's Granulomatosis is being treated with steroids, cyclophosphamide (cytoxan), and plasmapheresis. The patient is also receiving nutritional support and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of nephrolithiasis,
   no other chronic medical problems who presents with lower extremity
   edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 80% Fio2 facemask, 90-98%.
   Continues to desat to 80s when mask comes off.  Most likely secondary
   to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis. This morning he
   looks mor comfortable though CXR looks unchanged.  This is likely due
   to 2 days of diuresis, as he is -2.5L in the past 24 hours and -6.5L in
   the last 3 days.  Urine output remains high.
    - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   -Will give lasix 40IV for goal of -500
1L today.  We will also watch
   his urine output and restart IVF if necessary to keep >100cc/hr
    -Patients at Wegener
s are at increased risk for septal perforation.
   His septum is intact this am.  Will continue to check daily.
    - HCT down today, unlikely due to alveolar imprroving respiratory
   status, no hemoptysis.  Continue to monitor
   - If possible Will collect sputum to determine whether hemoptysis is
   tinged, bright red or just pink fronthy.
   -Continue nystatin mouthwash for [**Female First Name (un) 188**]+ sputum, though no sign of
   thrush.
   -CT of sinus has been recommended, but will not likely change
   management  so we will not order it at this time.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
     - treating the underlying disease-Wegeners:
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 4/7 yesterday, then next MWF.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-125 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  No MESNA
   needed, will give po H20 before dose
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  BUN still high
   but not increasing, no signs of platelet dysfunction yet, mental status
   ok.  Urine is less pink that previously.  Renal function has been
   steadily improving, likely as a response to Wegeners treatment. As a
   note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to
   improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - treating underlying cause (likely Wegener's)
   - Foley in place , strict I&O, q8 lytes.
   -pink tinged urine, improved. Will continue to monitor visually.  If
   worsening will get U/A.    It is also possible that his HCT is due to
   hemorrhagic cystitis given he is on cyclophosphamide,  though he has no
   signs of increasing hematuria at present.
    -On Sevelamer, for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
    -received 4IV CA last night
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKG unchanged
   # Tachycardia: Rate has been well controlled over the past 2 days.
   Asymptomatic, rate well controlled overnight. ECHO showed mild LV
   septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts
   (retaining total body fluid with renal failure, with large volume load
   putting stress on atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # Anemia: Low HCT originally due to pulmonary hemorrhage,  chronic
   inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   He received 1 unit yesterday and bumped appropriately but his HCT is
   down today.  HCT is likely due to fluid shifts with plasmapheresis.  He
   will not receive pheresis this weekend, so we can monitor to see if HCT
   stays stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, presenting with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress, requiring supplemental oxygen and a facemask. The patient has been diagnosed with C-ANCA vasculitis, and his condition has improved with diuresis and ongoing treatment. He is at increased risk for septal perforation, so his septum will be monitored daily. 

The patient also has acute renal failure confirmed by renal biopsy, but his renal function is improving. He is on plasmapheresis, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide as part of his treatment for Wegener's disease. His urine output remains high, and he is being closely monitored for any signs of worsening hematuria.

Additionally, the patient has hypocalcemia, which is being managed with calcium replacement and close monitoring of ionized calcium levels. An EKG showed mild LV septal hypertrophy, likely secondary to large volume shifts. 

The patient's tachycardia has been well-controlled with lopressor, and he is scheduled for an echo to further evaluate his cardiac status. He has anemia due to pulmonary hemorrhage, chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Blood products have been transfused as necessary, and his HCT will be monitored.

Other medical issues include fluid overload"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of nephrolithiasis,
   no other chronic medical problems who presents with lower extremity
   edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 80% Fio2 facemask, 90-98%.
   Continues to desat to 80s when mask comes off.  Most likely secondary
   to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis
    - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - HCT down today, unlikely due to alveolar imprroving respiratory
   status, no hemoptysis.  Continue to monitor
   -Continue nystatin mouthwash for [**Female First Name (un) 188**]+ sputum, though no sign of
   thrush.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 4/7 yesterday, then next MWF.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-125 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  No MESNA
   needed, will give po H20 before dose
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  As a note,
   plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to improve
   kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - Foley in place , strict I&O,
   -pink tinged urine, improved. Will continue to monitor visually.  If
   worsening will get U/A.    It is also possible that his HCT is due to
   hemorrhagic cystitis given he is on cyclophosphamide,  though he has no
   signs of increasing hematuria at present.
    -On Sevelamer, for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   # Tachycardia:  Asymptomatic, rate increases when active/talking,
   normal when sleeping.  ECHO showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # Anemia: Low HCT originally due to pulmonary hemorrhage,  chronic
   inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   He received 1 unit yesterday and bumped appropriately.
   -q12 HCT, transfuse if <21
    - Type and screen, cross-matched
    -  Blood consent obtained
    -  Stool guaiac negative yesterday, continue to check.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: Dialysis line in his neck, with pigtail.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
    # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, presenting with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

1. Respiratory distress: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and is desaturating in the 80s when the mask is removed. The most likely cause is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to C-ANCA vasculitis. Ongoing respiratory support and monitoring are required.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has confirmed C-ANCA vasculitis with renal involvement, as evidenced by renal biopsy. His creatinine levels are trending down, and he has good urine output. Plasmapheresis is being considered due to the severity of the case and potential improvement in kidney outcomes.

3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia is likely due to plasmapheresis containing citrate and underlying renal failure. Ionized calcium levels should be monitored, and SS replacement is recommended.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has a mild LV septal dysfunction and an increased heart rate during activity or talking. This could be secondary to large volume shifts in fluid due to renal failure. Lopressor has been titrated up to 50 mg PO tid to control the heart rate.

5. Anemia: The patient's low HCT is likely due to pulmonary hemorrhage, chronic inflammatory disease, renal failure,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory distress and acute renal failure. They have been diagnosed with Wegener's Granulomatosis and are currently receiving treatment with steroids, cytoxan, and plasmaphoresis. The patient's condition has shown a slow clinical response. They also have persistent tachycardia, attributed to hypoxemia and airspace disease. The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, aiming for a net negative balance if tolerated by blood pressure. Nutritional support is being encouraged through oral intake. Anemia is present but there is no evidence of acute bleeding, and the patient's hematocrit levels are being monitored. The patient is on ICU care, receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and acute renal failure indicate a compromised respiratory system. There is a potential risk of respiratory failure if the respiratory support is not maintained adequately.
2. Dialysis-Related Complications: As the patient's renal function is impaired, they may require dialysis. Complications associated with dialysis include hypotension, infection at the dialysis catheter site, electrolyte imbalances, and bleeding due to anticoagulation.
3. Infection: The patient is at an increased risk of developing infections due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently critically ill. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results suggest that he may have Wegener's granulomatosis, which is a type of autoimmune disease that affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. He is experiencing respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and tachycardia. The patient has received steroids, cytoxan, and plasmaphoresis for Wegener's granulomatosis, and his respiratory distress has shown gradual improvement. However, his renal function has plateaued over the past 2-3 days, indicating a potential need for dialysis. The patient's fluid balance is negative, and he is being encouraged to take oral fluids. He also has anemia and requires further evaluation. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress could progress to respiratory failure if his oxygenation or ventilation becomes significantly compromised.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to an increase in creatinine levels and a decline in urine output, potentially requiring dialysis.
3. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state from the underlying autoimmune disease and ICU stay, he is at risk for developing infections such as ventil"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of nephrolithiasis,
   no other chronic medical problems who presents with lower extremity
   edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 80% Fio2 facemask, 90-98%.
   Continues to desat to 80s when mask comes off.  Most likely secondary
   to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis
    - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - HCT down today, unlikely due to alveolar hemoorhave given improving
   respiratory status and no hemoptysis.  Continue to monitor with q12
   HCT.
   -Continue nystatin mouthwash for [**Female First Name (un) 188**]+ sputum, though no sign of
   thrush.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
   - CXR daily
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 5/7 today, then W/F.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-125 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  No MESNA
   needed, will give po H20 before dose
   - f/u Rheum recs
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  As a note,
   plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to improve
   kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - Foley in place , strict I&O,
   -pink tinged urine, improved. Will continue to monitor visually.  If
   worsening will get U/A.   It is also possible that his HCT is due to
   hemorrhagic cystitis given he is on cyclophosphamide,  though he has no
   signs of increasing hematuria at present.
    -On Sevelamer, for hyperphos. Phos at high end of normal today, will
   continue for at least one more day.
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   # Tachycardia:  Asymptomatic, rate increases when active/talking,
   normal when sleeping.  ECHO showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # Anemia: Low HCT originally due to pulmonary hemorrhage,  chronic
   inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   -q12 HCT, transfuse if <21
    - Type and screen, cross-matched
    -  Blood consent obtained
    -  Stool guaiac negative thus far, continue to check all stools.
   #Hyperglycemia- non-diabetic, likely [**12-29**] high dose steroids.
   -SSI plus standing
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: Dialysis line in his neck, with pigtail.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and nephritic syndrome. He was diagnosed with c-ANCA vasculitis and treated with cyclophosphamide, steroids, and plasmapheresis. His kidney function has improved steadily without needing dialysis, and his respiratory status is stable with the use of a facemask to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient also has hyperglycemia due to steroid use and is being treated with insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to desaturate when the facemask is removed, which may indicate ongoing respiratory issues. This could be due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to c-ANCA vasculitis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending down, and urine output is good. However, there is a risk of further kidney damage due to underlying c-ANCA vasculitis and potential hemorrhagic cystitis from cyclophosphamide.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's ionized calcium levels may be affected by plasmapheresis containing citrate and underlying renal failure. Monitoring and SS replacement are recommended.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate increases with activity or talking, likely due to large volume shifts associated with renal failure. Lopress"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of nephrolithiasis,
   no other chronic medical problems who presents with lower extremity
   edema and SOB.
    Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 80% Fio2 facemask, 90-98%.
   Continues to desat to 80s when mask comes off.  Most likely secondary
   to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis
    - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
   - HCT down today, unlikely due to alveolar imprroving respiratory
   status, no hemoptysis.  Continue to monitor
   -Continue nystatin mouthwash for [**Female First Name (un) 188**]+ sputum, though no sign of
   thrush.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
    - CXR daily
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 5/7 today, then W/F.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
   -Cyclophosphamide-125 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  No MESNA
   needed, will give po H20 before dose
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine trending down, good urine output.  As a note,
   plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to improve
   kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - Foley in place , strict I&O,
   -pink tinged urine, improved. Will continue to monitor visually.  If
   worsening will get U/A.    It is also possible that his HCT is due to
   hemorrhagic cystitis given he is on cyclophosphamide,  though he has no
   signs of increasing hematuria at present.
    -On Sevelamer, for hyperphos
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   # Tachycardia:  Asymptomatic, rate increases when active/talking,
   normal when sleeping.  ECHO showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**]
   45-50%.  Likely secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body
   fluid with renal failure, with large volume load putting stress on
   atria.)
   - Continue lopressor titrated up to 50 mg PO tid with good rate control
   (HR in 80s).
   # Anemia: Low HCT originally due to pulmonary hemorrhage,  chronic
   inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   He received 1 unit yesterday and bumped appropriately.
   -q12 HCT, transfuse if <21
    - Type and screen, cross-matched
    -  Blood consent obtained
    -  Stool guaiac negative thus far, continue to check all stools.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: Dialysis line in his neck, with pigtail.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
    # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])

   This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of nephrolithiasis,
   no other chronic medical problems who presents with lower extremity
   edema and SOB.
     Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Has been stable on 6L NC.  Most likely
   secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis.  CXR
   shows interval improvement, patient appears to be responding to
   diuresis as well.
    - Wean 02  to keep sat >90%.
    - HCT decreased to 21.3 this morning, unlikely due to alveolar
   hemoorhave given improving respiratory status and no hemoptysis.
   Probably due to plasmapheresis and fluid shifting.  His respiratory
   status may be marginally helped by an increased HCT, but will check pm
   HCT and transfuse if <21.
   -Continue nystatin mouthwash for [**Female First Name (un) 188**]+ sputum given his high dose
   steroids.  Day [**3-7**]
   - Atrovent nebs PRN  (albuterol nebs held due to tachycardia)
   - CXR daily
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 5/7 yesterday, then tomorrow and Friday.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
    -Cyclophosphamide-125 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  No MESNA
   needed, will give po H20 before dose
   - f/u Rheum recs
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine continues to trend down, 4.3 this morning, BUN is
   also finally down to 135, and he has maintained good urine output.  As
   a note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners has been shown to
   improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - Foley in place , strict I&O,we have been diuresing him well, with ?
   liters off in the past 5 days.  We will continue to diurese with goal
   -500cc to -1L, using Lasix 20 IV prn.
    -pink tinged urine, improved. Will continue to monitor visually.  If
   worsening will get U/A
     -On Sevelamer, for hyperphos. Phos 4.0, will continue for at least
   one more day.
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Received 4gIV overnight, will re-check PM ionized Calcium and replete
   as needed.  On days when he has pheresis, ionized CA needs to be drawn
   4 hours after the end of pheresis to be accurate.
   -on SS replacement.
   -EKGs have been unchanged.
   # Tachycardia:  Continued tachycardia, atrial flutter.  Hemodynamically
   stable.  ECHO showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 45-50%.  Possibly
   secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body fluid with renal
   failure, with large volume load putting stress on atria.)
   -Increased lopressor to 75mg po tid yesterday.  Will continue to
   monitor on tele.  If needed, could start a second rate controlling
   [**Doctor Last Name **].
   # Anemia: Low HCT originally due to pulmonary hemorrhage,  chronic
   inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   HCT have been variable over the weekend despite no transfusion.
   Variation may be due to lab variability, or to fluid shifts with
   plasmapheresis.  Will monitor as long as he is hemodynamically stable.
   -qday HCT, transfuse if <21.  21.3 today, will check PM and transfuse 1
   unit if <21.
    - Type and screen, cross-matched
    -  Blood consent obtained
     -  Stool guaiac negative thus far, continue to check all stools.
   #Hyperglycemia- non-diabetic, likely [**12-29**] high dose steroids.
   -SSI plus standing 3units, well controlled.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, lower extremity edema, and shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress, acute renal failure, hypocalcemia, tachycardia, anemia, hyperglycemia, and other medical conditions. The patient is being treated with plasmapheresis, steroids, cyclophosphamide, diuretics, and other medications. He has been responding well to treatment, with improving respiratory status and decreasing creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage: The patient's respiratory distress could be secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to C-ANCA vasculitis. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and daily chest X-rays are necessary to assess the progression of this condition.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has confirmed C-ANCA vasculitis leading to acute renal failure. Regular monitoring of kidney function through creatinine and BUN levels is crucial. Diuresis should be continued to maintain adequate urine output.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia is likely due to plasmapheresis containing citrate and underlying renal failure. Ionized calcium levels should be closely monitored, especially after each pheresis session. Repletion of calcium as needed is important.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's continued tach"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year-old male with a distant history of nephrolithiasis,
   no other chronic medical problems who presents with lower extremity
   edema and SOB.
     Plan:
    # Respiratory distress: Requiring 6L NC and 60% Fio2 face tent,
   90-98%. Continues to desat to 80s when mask comes off.  Most likely
   secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis.  CXR
   shows interval improvement, patient appears to be responding to
   diuresis as well.
    - Continue supplemental O2 PRN.  Maintain O2 sat >90%.
    - HCT decreased to 21.3 this morning, unlikely due to alveolar
   hemoorhave given improving respiratory status and no hemoptysis.
   Probably due to plasmapheresis, given with  50% albumin yesterday.
   -Continue nystatin mouthwash for [**Female First Name (un) 188**]+ sputum, though no sign of
   thrush.
   - Atrovent nebs PRN  (albuterol nebs held due to tachycardia)
   - CXR daily
   -Plasmapheresis, dose 5/7 yesterday, then W/F.
   -Prednisone 60mg po daily,
    -Cyclophosphamide-125 po. Rheumatology will write for this.  No MESNA
   needed, will give po H20 before dose
   - f/u Rheum recs
   # Acute renal failure: [**12-29**] C-ANCA vasculitis, confirmed with renal
   biopsy.  Creatinine up to 4.3 from 4.0 yesterday, BUN down to 135, good
   urine output.  As a note, plasmapheresis in cases of severe Wegeners
   has been shown to improve kidney outcomes, though not mortality.
   - Foley in place , strict I&O,we have been diuresing him well, with ?
   liters off in the past 5 days.  His creatinine bumped a little bit this
   morning, probably we are at his dry weight and can back off on
   diuresis.
    -pink tinged urine, improved. Will continue to monitor visually.  If
   worsening will get U/A
     -On Sevelamer, for hyperphos. Phos 4.0, will continue for at least
   one more day.
   -          Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -          on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis, avoiding Bactrim due to
   renal toxicity.
    #Hypocalcemia: [**12-29**] plasmapheresis (containing citrate) and to
   underlying renal failure
   -follow ionized Ca, more accurate given citrate used in pheresis.
   Waiting at least 4 hours after pheresis for accurate [**Location (un) 308**].
   -on SS replacement.
   # Tachycardia:  Continued tachycardia, atrial flutter.  Hemodynamically
   stable.  ECHO showed mild LV septal [**Last Name (LF) 4197**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] 45-50%.  Possibly
   secondary to large volume shifts (retaining total body fluid with renal
   failure, with large volume load putting stress on atria.)
   -Increased lopressor to 75mg po tid yesterday.
   # Anemia: Low HCT originally due to pulmonary hemorrhage,  chronic
   inflammatory disease, renal failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   HCT have been low in the morning and higher in the afternoon for the
   past 2 days despite no transfusion and no plasmapheresis.  Variation
   may be due to lab variability, fluid shifts during the day, or another
   unknown cause.  Will monitor as long as he is hemodynamically stable.
   -qday HCT, transfuse if <21.  21.3 today, will check PM and transfuse 1
   unit.
    - Type and screen, cross-matched
    -  Blood consent obtained
     -  Stool guaiac negative thus far, continue to check all stools.
   #Hyperglycemia- non-diabetic, likely [**12-29**] high dose steroids.
   -SSI plus standing 3units, well controlled.
   # FEN: Taking PO. Will replete lytes PRN.
   # Access: Dialysis line in his neck, with pigtail.
   # PPx: Pneumoboots, Pantoprazole PO daily, RISS, bowel regimen
    # Code: FULL, confirmed with pt with son present ([**2199-7-6**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of nephrolithiasis, presenting with lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. He has been diagnosed with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to C-ANCA vasculitis, acute renal failure, hypocalcemia, tachycardia, anemia, hyperglycemia, and fluid overload. The patient is currently receiving plasmapheresis, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, diuretics, Atrovent nebs, and Sevelamer. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate in the range of 100-142 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/62 mmHg to 138/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, low hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with several medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has a history of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to C-ANCA vasculitis. This condition can lead to severe lung damage and respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, which may worsen his overall"

   Assessment and Plan
 VASCULITIS -- Wegener's Granulomatosis.  Good response.  Continue
   steroids, cytoxan.  Complete Plasmaphoresis course.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]) -- Pulmonary-Renal
   syndrome; predominately alveolar hemorrhage.  Improving.  Reduced
   oxygen requirement.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) -- continue gradual
   improvement.  Monitor.  No acute indication for dialysis.
 HYPOCALCEMIA (LOW CALCIUM) -- replete, monitor ionized Ca++
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) -- acceptable rate control on lopressor.
   Monitor.
 TACHYCARDIA -- improved.  Monitor.
 ANEMIA -- No further clinical evidence for bleeding, CXR improving.
   Transfuse to Hct >21.
 HYPERGLYCEMIA -- contributed by high dose steroids.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including Wegener's Granulomatosis (vасculitis), pulmonary-renal syndrome, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypocalcemia, atrial flutter, tachycardia, anemia, and hyperglycemia.

The patient has been receiving various treatments such as steroids, cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 114 to 142 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/74 to 138/86 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 21 to 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation ranging from 97% to 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, glucose, and lactic acid. Other lab values including creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium are within normal limits. The patient's CXR reveals diffuse pulmonary infiltrates but is improving.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, further electrolyte imbalances, and complications related to the ongoing treatment such as infection or adverse effects of medications.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be improving"
