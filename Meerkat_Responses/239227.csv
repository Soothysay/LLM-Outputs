   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no current history of Diabetes, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S and LFTs normal.
   Aggressive volume resuscitation as likely with substantial third
   spacing - may require up to 10L of fluid per day.  Given negative CT
   scan for necrosis no indication to consider antibiotics at this point.
   - Monitor for complications
   - Triglycerides -> mildly elevated
   - abdominal U/S -> Limited study, no obvious intrahepatic ductal
   dilation
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - appreciate surgery recs: no intervention at this time, will follow
   - Monitor ionized calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis.  aggressive volume
   resuscitation, replete K+, monitor gap.  Likely now with hyperchloremic
   acidosis [**3-8**] over-resuscitation with NS IVF.
   - Continue insulin gtt while pt continues to be NPO and clinical course
   still unpredictable
   - q1H FSG's
   - D10 for IVF
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - Check A1C
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: ?[**3-8**] to underresuscitation or whether
   patient has progressed to ATN (more likely).  UOP has picked up on
   arrival.  No indication for acute hemodialysis at this time.
   - Aggressive volume challenge with intubation PRN
   - Consult renal in AM, no need for acute HD overnight.
   - foley placement, follow UOP.
   - Renal ultrasound for obstruction, renal lytes
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   - follow lytes
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer.
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: improving
   - Acidemia: follow VBG
   - Trend phosphate as well, aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation
   - will change to Dilaudid PCA today.
   .
   #. HTN: Supportive care, hold outpatient BP meds in setting of severe
   acute pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Check lipid panel to r/o hypertriglyceridemia as
   cause for pancreatitis.
   - triglycerides not severely elevated enough to be likely cause of
   pancreatitis
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's, strict NPO status -> will need PICC/central line today
   to receive TPN, will try to transition to
trophic
 TFs through
   post-pyloric tube next week (if can not tolerate POs)
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SQ
   -Stress ulcer with PPI IV
   .
   ACCESS: [**Last Name (LF) 3092**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] request PICC today ([**4-2**]) and if unsuccessful will
   obtain CVL

   Critical Care
   Glu improving and may sl better but creat remains elevated, pH low
   (mostly non-gap acidosis), and c/o severe abd pain.  We are giving IVF
   primarily as 0.5NS, repleting phos and K+, initiating PCA for pain
   control, dosing meds for renal failure.  It is concerning that he is
   not compensating for metab acidosis.  We will obtain central access,
   initiate feeding IV this weekend with plan for post pyloric feeding if
   pancreatitis is still severe by Monday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a chief complaint of severe abdominal pain. He was admitted to the ICU for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/68 mmHg to 140/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

The patient has limited study results showing no obvious intrahepatic ductal dilation. His labs show elevated white blood cell count (19.1 K/uL), hemoglobin (13.6 g/dL), blood glucose levels (354 and 235 mg/dL), creatinine (3.2 and 2.8 mg/dL), potassium (3.9 mEq/L), chloride (113 mEq/L), and bicarbonate (19.1 K/uL). His other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Acute pancreatitis: The cause is unclear, but it may be related to medications, hypertriglyceridemia, stone passage, or viral infection. There is no evidence of ductal dilation on CT scan or ultrasound, and liver function tests are normal. Ag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute pancreatitis, DKA, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for further management. He is currently on insulin, fluids, and other medications for his conditions. The patient is also at risk for complications such as respiratory distress syndrome, hyperlipidemia, gout, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is tachypneic and has mildly severe pancreatitis, which increases the likelihood of developing ARDS.
2. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's pancreatitis may be related to hypertriglyceridemia, so it is important to check the lipid panel.
3. Gout: The patient has renal failure, and colchicine should be held in this setting.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis with heparin is recommended due to the patient's immobility and risk factors.
5. Stress Ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to severe illness and should be on prophylactic PPI.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's respiratory support, there is a risk for VAP, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent it.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no current history of Diabetes, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S and LFTs normal.
   Aggressive volume resuscitation as likely with substantial third
   spacing - may require up to 10L of fluid per day.  Given negative CT
   scan for necrosis no indication to consider antibiotics at this point.
   - Monitor for complications
   - Triglycerides -> mildly elevated
   - abdominal U/S -> Limited study, no obvious intrahepatic ductal
   dilation
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - appreciate surgery recs: no intervention at this time, will follow
   - Monitor ionized calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis.  aggressive volume
   resuscitation, replete K+, monitor gap.  Likely now with hyperchloremic
   acidosis [**3-8**] over-resuscitation with NS IVF.
   - Continue insulin gtt while pt continues to be NPO and clinical course
   still unpredictable
   - q1H FSG's
   - D10 for IVF
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - Check A1C
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: ?[**3-8**] to underresuscitation or whether
   patient has progressed to ATN (more likely).  UOP has picked up on
   arrival.  No indication for acute hemodialysis at this time.
   - Aggressive volume challenge with intubation PRN
   - Consult renal in AM, no need for acute HD overnight.
   - foley placement, follow UOP.
   - Renal ultrasound for obstruction, renal lytes
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   - follow lytes
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer.
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: improving
   - Acidemia: follow VBG
   - Trend phosphate as well, aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation
   - will change to Dilaudid PCA today.
   .
   #. HTN: Supportive care, hold outpatient BP meds in setting of severe
   acute pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Check lipid panel to r/o hypertriglyceridemia as
   cause for pancreatitis.
   - triglycerides not severely elevated enough to be likely cause of
   pancreatitis
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's, strict NPO status -> will need PICC/central line today
   to receive TPN, will try to transition to
trophic
 TFs through
   post-pyloric tube next week (if can not tolerate POs)
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SQ
   -Stress ulcer with PPI IV
   .
   ACCESS: [**Last Name (LF) 3092**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] request PICC today ([**4-2**]) and if unsuccessful will
   obtain CVL

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no current history of Diabetes, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S and LFTs normal.
   Aggressive volume resuscitation as likely with substantial third
   spacing - may require up to 10L of fluid per day.  Given negative CT
   scan for necrosis no indication to consider antibiotics at this point.
   - Monitor for complications
   - Triglycerides -> mildly elevated
   - abdominal U/S -> Limited study, no obvious intrahepatic ductal
   dilation
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - appreciate surgery recs: no intervention at this time, will follow
   - Monitor ionized calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis.  aggressive volume
   resuscitation, replete K+, monitor gap.  Likely now with hyperchloremic
   acidosis [**3-8**] over-resuscitation with NS IVF.
   - Continue insulin gtt while pt continues to be NPO and clinical course
   still unpredictable
   - q1H FSG's
   - D10 for IVF
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - Check A1C
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: ?[**3-8**] to underresuscitation or whether
   patient has progressed to ATN (more likely).  UOP has picked up on
   arrival.  No indication for acute hemodialysis at this time.
   - Aggressive volume challenge with intubation PRN
   - Consult renal in AM, no need for acute HD overnight.
   - foley placement, follow UOP.
   - Renal ultrasound for obstruction, renal lytes
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   - follow lytes
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer.
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: improving
   - Acidemia: follow VBG
   - Trend phosphate as well, aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation
   - will change to Dilaudid PCA today.
   .
   #. HTN: Supportive care, hold outpatient BP meds in setting of severe
   acute pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Check lipid panel to r/o hypertriglyceridemia as
   cause for pancreatitis.
   - triglycerides not severely elevated enough to be likely cause of
   pancreatitis
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's, strict NPO status -> will need PICC/central line today
   to receive TPN, will try to transition to
trophic
 TFs through
   post-pyloric tube next week (if can not tolerate POs)
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SQ
   -Stress ulcer with PPI IV
   .
   ACCESS: [**Last Name (LF) 3092**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] request PICC today ([**4-2**]) and if unsuccessful will

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no history of diabetes who is being transferred to another hospital for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has received aggressive volume resuscitation and is being closely monitored for complications. The assessment and plan include monitoring for complications such as triglycerides, abdominal ultrasound, calcium levels, complete blood count (CBC) for bleeding, and trends in electrolytes. The patient's respiratory status is also being monitored due to the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient may experience complications such as necrosis or infection of the pancreas. Close monitoring of symptoms and imaging studies will be necessary to detect these complications early.

2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's DKA should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to correct the acidosis and replete potassium levels. There is a risk of over-resuscitation leading to hyperchloremic acidosis.

3. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and further evaluation for potential causes of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) should be conducted. Aggressive volume challenge may be required.

4. Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for signs of ARDS or severe pulmonary complications. Adequate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no current history of Diabetes, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S and LFTs normal.
   Aggressive volume resuscitation as likely with substantial third
   spacing - may require up to 10L of fluid per day.  Given negative CT
   scan for necrosis no indication to consider antibiotics at this point,
   although if spikes fever would consider rescanning and starting abx.
   - continue aggressive fluid [**Month/Day (2) 4915**] with D5NS with 3 amp bicarb
   at 250 cc/hr today with NS boluses PRN
   - fell behind with fluids overnight, will be very aggressive today
   - Triglycerides -> mildly elevated
   - abdominal U/S -> Limited study, no obvious intrahepatic ductal
   dilation
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - appreciate surgery recs: no intervention at this time, will follow
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis.  aggressive volume
   resuscitation, replete K+, monitor gap.  Had decreased insulin
   requirement overnight and then gap rewidened
   - AG 16 this morning, has reopened likely due to not enough fluid
   [**Last Name (LF) 4915**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] monitor closely throughout day
   - Continue insulin gtt with D5NS fluids while pt continues to be NPO
   and clinical course still unpredictable
   - q1H FSG's
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - Check A1C
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: initially poor UOP, then did well with
   fluid [**First Name3 (LF) 4915**] and Cr from 3.2 to 2.0; probably prerenal
   etiology.  Again today UOP has decreased and Cr up to 2.7; again likely
   prerenal and will give aggressive fluids.  UOP has picked up on
   arrival.  No indication for acute hemodialysis at this time.
   - Aggressive volume challenge with intubation PRN
   - foley placement, follow UOP.
   - Renal ultrasound for obstruction, renal lytes
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   - follow lytes
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer.
   - lungs clear, tachypnea likely secondary to resp compensation in
   setting of acidosis; giving bicarb and following respiratory status for
   now
   - O2 PRN
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: worse today
   - Acidemia: follow VBG
   - Trend phosphate as well, aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation
   - still with pain, continue morphine PCA
   .
   #. HTN: Supportive care, hold outpatient BP meds in setting of severe
   acute pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Check lipid panel to r/o hypertriglyceridemia as
   cause for pancreatitis.
   - triglycerides not severely elevated enough to be likely cause of
   pancreatitis
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's, strict NPO status -> has PICC, consider TPN in future
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SQ
   -Stress ulcer with PPI IV
   .
   ACCESS: PICC, one PIV

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a diagnosis of DKA, acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is being transferred to another hospital for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is described as tachypnea, and there is a likelihood of manifesting ARDS due to mildly severe pancreatitis. Close monitoring of the respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. Aggressive volume resuscitation may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric acute renal failure, which means decreased urine output. This can progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) if not properly managed. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and close monitoring of renal function are essential.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and phosphate, are abnormal. Close monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances are necessary to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.

5. Infection: The patient has a risk of developing infections, particularly in the setting of pancreatitis and prolonged ICU stay. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered to prevent infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to immobilization and the presence of multiple risk factors, the patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be initiated.

7. Hypocalcemia: The patient may be at risk of hypocalcemia due to ongoing fluid resuscitation and insulin therapy. Monitoring of ionized calcium levels is necessary to prevent complications associated with hypocalcemia.

8. Pain Management: The patient is experiencing pain, and adequate pain control is essential to improve comfort and prevent complications associated with uncontrolled pain.

9. Malnutrition: Due to the patient's inability to eat orally (NPO status), there is a risk of malnutrition. Nutritional support, such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), may be required in the future.

10. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at an increased risk of stress ulcers due to critical illness and immobilization. Prophylactic stress ulcer treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is recommended.

The Answer is: The potential medical complications that can arise include ARDS, hypotension, renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, infection, DVT, hypocalcemia, pain management, malnutrition, and stress ulcer prophylaxis."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old man admitted to the ICU with malaise, DKA, and pancreatitis. He initially presented with ketones but now has worsening acidosis and continued abdominal pain. The patient has been receiving insulin and morphine infusions, along with other ICU medications. His vital signs include a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/64 mmHg to 156/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance with diffuse abdominal tenderness and mild peripheral edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin T, elevated amylase and lipase levels, acute renal failure, and altered electrolyte levels. The patient's acidosis has closed, but he has not had any urine output since this morning. The assessment and plan include aggressive fluid resuscitation, changing the IV fluids to D5 with HCO3 to address non-AG acidosis and improve breathing, considering the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), continuing glucose and insulin for diabetes management, and providing ICU care with appropriate prophylaxis measures.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male admitted to the ICU with malaise, DKA, and pancreatitis. He has resolved ketones but is now experiencing worsening acidosis and persistent abdominal pain. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type I. He has been receiving insulin infusions and other medications in the ICU. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/64 mmHg to 156/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and is now being given D5 with HCO3 to help with his breathing.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are significantly high. Kidney function tests indicate an increase in creatinine levels, suggesting acute renal failure. Liver function tests are within normal limits, while amylase and lipase levels are elevated, consistent with pancreatitis. Electrolyte levels are also abnormal.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's DKA has closed, but there is a slight increase in serum bicarbonate levels. Pancreatitis is unclear in terms of precipitant. Acute renal failure has developed, with no urine output since this morning. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is being provided."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of tachypnea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for suspected diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with acute pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 111/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids and insulin infusion.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for toothache, which started pre-hospitalization, and poor dentition. The patient has a missing tooth and did not appreciate an abscess. The patient's physical examination shows tenderness in the epigastric region, right upper quadrant, and left lower quadrant. The patient's mental status is more depressed today compared to yesterday.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and elevated creatinine. The patient's arterial blood gas reveals metabolic acidosis with an anion gap.

The patient's assessment includes pain control, DKA, acute pancreatitis, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure. The patient has multiple lines in place, including a 20-gauge catheter, PICC line, and arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of metabolic acidosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no current history of Diabetes, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S and LFTs normal.
   Aggressive volume resuscitation as likely with substantial third
   spacing - may require up to 10L of fluid per day.  Given negative CT
   scan for necrosis no indication to consider antibiotics at this point,
   although if spikes fever would consider rescanning and starting abx.
   - continue aggressive fluid [**Month/Day (2) 4915**] with D5NS with 3 amp bicarb
   at 250 cc/hr today with NS boluses PRN
   - fell behind with fluids overnight, will be very aggressive today
   - Triglycerides -> mildly elevated
   - abdominal U/S -> Limited study, no obvious intrahepatic ductal
   dilation
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - appreciate surgery recs: no intervention at this time, will follow
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis.  aggressive volume
   resuscitation, replete K+, monitor gap.  Had decreased insulin
   requirement overnight and then gap rewidened
   - AG 16 this morning, has reopened likely due to not enough fluid
   [**Last Name (LF) 4915**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] monitor closely throughout day
   - Continue insulin gtt with D5NS fluids while pt continues to be NPO
   and clinical course still unpredictable
   - q1H FSG's
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - Check A1C
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: initially poor UOP, then did well with
   fluid [**First Name3 (LF) 4915**] and Cr from 3.2 to 2.0; probably prerenal
   etiology.  Again today UOP has decreased and Cr up to 2.7; again likely
   prerenal and will give aggressive fluids.  UOP has picked up on
   arrival.  No indication for acute hemodialysis at this time.
   - Aggressive volume challenge with intubation PRN
   - foley placement, follow UOP.
   - Renal ultrasound for obstruction, renal lytes
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   - follow lytes
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer.
   - lungs clear, tachypnea likely secondary to resp compensation in
   setting of acidosis; giving bicarb and following respiratory status for
   now
   - O2 PRN
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: worse today
   - Acidemia: follow VBG
   - Trend phosphate as well, aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation
   - still with pain, continue morphine PCA
   .
   #. HTN: Supportive care, hold outpatient BP meds in setting of severe
   acute pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Check lipid panel to r/o hypertriglyceridemia as
   cause for pancreatitis.
   - triglycerides not severely elevated enough to be likely cause of
   pancreatitis
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's, strict NPO status -> has PICC, consider TPN in future
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SQ
   -Stress ulcer with PPI IV
   .
   ACCESS: PICC, one PIV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no history of diabetes. He was admitted with DKA, acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by aggressive IVF resuscitation, worsening fluid overload, anion gap closing, tenderness in the abdomen, toothache, poor dentition, malfunctioning IV line, and severe underlying anxiety. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 111/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on insulin, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications as per ICU protocol. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, increased Cr, TCO2, glucose, and other abnormalities. The patient's assessment and plan include management of acute pancreatitis, DKA, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient is being aggressive with fluid resuscitation and monitoring for potential complications such as infection or necrosis. The patient's respiratory status is also being closely monitored due to the risk of ARDS."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no history of diabetes, being transferred to another hospital for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. He has been aggressively resuscitated with IV fluids due to substantial third spacing and may require up to 10 liters of fluid per day. There is no indication for antibiotics at this point, but if he spikes fever, consideration will be given to rescanning and starting antibiotics. His triglycerides are mildly elevated, and an abdominal ultrasound did not show any obvious intrahepatic ductal dilation. The patient's [Last Name (un)] score is 1% predicted mortality by [Last Name (un)] criteria at OSH. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is unclear in origin, with possible causes including medications, hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), a stone that passed or viral infection. There is no ductal dilation on CT scan or ultrasound, and liver function tests are normal. The patient is at risk for developing necrotizing pancreatitis, which can lead to sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Aggressive volume resuscitation and close monitoring for signs of infection or complications such as pseudocysts or abscesses are necessary.

2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient likely has severe DKA, which may have contributed"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no previous history of diabetes who was
   transferred from OSH for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S and LFTs normal.
   Aggressive volume resuscitation as likely with substantial third
   spacing - may require up to 10L of fluid per day.  Given negative CT
   scan for necrosis no indication to consider antibiotics at this point,
   although if spikes fever would consider rescanning and starting abx.
   - aggressively rehydrated, will titrate to UOP. Still requiring insulin
   drip
   - [**Doctor First Name 91**] following along; no surgical interventions indicated at this
   time.
   - no reimaging at this time, consider if he spikes; abx if hemodynamics
   / fever curve changes
   - Triglycerides -> mildly elevated
   - abdominal U/S -> Limited study, no obvious intrahepatic ductal
   dilation
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis.  Aggressive volume
   resuscitation, replete K+, monitor gap.  Had decreased insulin
   requirement yesterday and then gap rewidened; continues on insulin gtt
   - AG closed, continuing insulin gtt and D5NS today
   - q1H FSG's
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - Check A1C
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: initially poor UOP, then did well with
   fluid resuccitation and Cr from 3.2 to 2.0; probably prerenal
   etiology.  Again today UOP has decreased and Cr up to 2.7; again likely
   prerenal and will give aggressive fluids.  Cr still high in setting of
   better UOP, likely has ATN
   - follow Cr, fluid titrated to urine output
   - foley placement, follow UOP.
   - f/u renal lytes
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer.
   - tachypnea better as his acidosis no longer needs heavy compensation
   - cardiac wheezes from fluid overload, intubate PRN
   - O2 PRN
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: improving
   - Acidemia: follow VBG
   - Trend phosphate as well, aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation
   - still with pain, continue morphine PCA
   .
   #. HTN: Supportive care, hold outpatient BP meds in setting of severe
   acute pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Check lipid panel to r/o hypertriglyceridemia as
   cause for pancreatitis.
   - triglycerides not severely elevated enough to be likely cause of
   pancreatitis
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's, strict NPO status -> plan for post pyloric tube today
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SQ
   -Stress ulcer with PPI IV
   .
   ACCESS: PICC, one PIV

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no previous history of diabetes who was transferred to the ICU for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function. The patient is currently on insulin drip, aggressive volume resuscitation, and receiving pain control medication. The plan includes monitoring ionized calcium, trending CBC for bleeding, and repleting potassium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient is at risk for complications associated with acute pancreatitis, such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, pseudocyst, and secondary infection.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient may experience further complications related to DKA, including cerebral edema, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric renal failure could progress to AKI, leading to the need for dialysis and potential long-term kidney damage.
4. Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's tachypnea and potential for severe pulmonary complications due to pancreatitis, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can require mechanical ventilation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no previous history of diabetes who was
   transferred from OSH for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No alcohol history. No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S
   and LFTs normal. Has been aggressively volume resuscitated
 27L
   positive for LOS. Given negative CT scan for necrosis no indication to
   consider antibiotics at this point, although if spikes fever would
   consider rescanning and starting abx.
   - aggressively rehydrated, now has signs of volume overload clinically.
   Trial of small dose Lasix today
   - [**Doctor First Name 91**] following along; no surgical interventions indicated at this
   time.
   - no reimaging at this time, consider if he spikes; abx if hemodynamics
   / fever curve changes
   - Triglycerides -> mildly elevated
   - abdominal U/S -> Limited study, no obvious intrahepatic ductal
   dilation; If LFTs/Lipase increase, recheck U/S
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding.
   - Review outside radiographic CTs with radiology
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis.  Aggressive volume
   resuscitation, replete K+, monitor gap.  Had decreased insulin
   requirement yesterday and then gap rewidened; continues on insulin gtt
   - AG closed, continuing insulin gtt and D10 (switched from D5 to reduce
   fluid intake given volume overload on exam) today
   - q1H FSG's
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - Plan for transition to SQ insulin once post-pyloric dobhoff is placed
   and pt has a steady means to carbohydrate intake.
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: Likely prerenal in etiology. Cr
   continuing to trend downward. UOP adequate at this time.
   - Trial of Lasix today for volume overload
 monitor UOP
   - f/u renal lytes
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer.
   - tachypnea better as his acidosis no longer needs heavy compensation
   - cardiac wheezes from fluid overload, intubate PRN
   - Diuresis today so pt can better tolerate Dobhoff placement tomorrow
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: improving
   - Acidemia: follow ABG
   - Trend phosphate as well, aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation
   - still with pain, pt unable to physically use PCA; will give morphine
   boluses PRN instead
   .
   #. HTN: Supportive care, hold outpatient BP meds in setting of severe
   acute pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Ileus: No BM since admission; likely due to NPO status and narcotics
   for pain
   - Colace
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's, strict NPO status -> plan for post pyloric tube tomorrow
   after diuresis today
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SQ
   -Stress ulcer with Famotidine
   .
   ACCESS: PICC, one PIV

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no previous history of diabetes who was transferred to the ICU for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated but now shows signs of volume overload. He has been aggressively rehydrated and is currently on insulin gtt to manage his DKA. The patient's pancreatitis is unclear in origin and there is no evidence of necrosis on the CT scan. Antibiotics have not been indicated at this time. The patient's renal function is improving, but he still requires careful monitoring and management of his electrolytes. His respiratory status is being closely monitored due to the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe pulmonary complications. Pain control remains a concern as the patient is still experiencing pain and unable to use PCA. The patient's hypertension is being managed with supportive care, and ileus is also a concern due to his NPO status and use of narcotics. The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and prophylactic measures are being taken. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume overload: The patient is showing signs of volume overload after aggressive volume resuscitation. This can lead to pulmonary edema, hypertension, and heart failure.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored due to the possibility"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no previous history of diabetes who was
   transferred from OSH for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S and LFTs normal.
   Aggressive volume resuscitation as likely with substantial third
   spacing - may require up to 10L of fluid per day.  Given negative CT
   scan for necrosis no indication to consider antibiotics at this point,
   although if spikes fever would consider rescanning and starting abx.
   - aggressively rehydrated, will titrate to UOP. Still requiring insulin
   drip
   - [**Doctor First Name 91**] following along; no surgical interventions indicated at this
   time.
   - no reimaging at this time, consider if he spikes; abx if hemodynamics
   / fever curve changes
   - Triglycerides -> mildly elevated
   - abdominal U/S -> Limited study, no obvious intrahepatic ductal
   dilation
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis.  Aggressive volume
   resuscitation, replete K+, monitor gap.  Had decreased insulin
   requirement yesterday and then gap rewidened; continues on insulin gtt
   - AG closed, continuing insulin gtt and D5NS today
   - q1H FSG's
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - Check A1C
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: initially poor UOP, then did well with
   fluid resuccitation and Cr from 3.2 to 2.0; probably prerenal
   etiology.  Again today UOP has decreased and Cr up to 2.7; again likely
   prerenal and will give aggressive fluids.  Cr still high in setting of
   better UOP, likely has ATN
   - follow Cr, fluid titrated to urine output
   - foley placement, follow UOP.
   - f/u renal lytes
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer.
   - tachypnea better as his acidosis no longer needs heavy compensation
   - cardiac wheezes from fluid overload, intubate PRN
   - O2 PRN
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: improving
   - Acidemia: follow VBG
   - Trend phosphate as well, aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation
   - still with pain, continue morphine PCA
   .
   #. HTN: Supportive care, hold outpatient BP meds in setting of severe
   acute pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Check lipid panel to r/o hypertriglyceridemia as
   cause for pancreatitis.
   - triglycerides not severely elevated enough to be likely cause of
   pancreatitis
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's, strict NPO status -> plan for post pyloric tube today
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SQ
   -Stress ulcer with PPI IV
   .
   ACCESS: PICC, one PIV

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and acute renal failure. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is tachypneic, and there is a likelihood of manifesting ARDS due to mildly severe pancreatitis. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory function is necessary. Intubation may be required if the patient's condition worsens.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating potential hypotension. Monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of DKA, and insulin therapy is ongoing. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is crucial to maintain glycemic control.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric acute renal failure, and there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function, including serum creatinine and urine output, is necessary. Fluid management should be tailored to maintain adequate urine output.

5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly due to the presence of a feeding tube and central lines. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as"

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of no previous diabetes, who was transferred to the ICU for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated and now shows signs of volume overload. His triglycerides are mildly elevated, and abdominal ultrasound did not show any intrahepatic ductal dilation. The patient's calcium levels are being monitored due to the risk of precipitating calcium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, likely due to unclear precipitants. There is a risk of developing complications such as pancreatic necrosis or infected pancreatic necrosis.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient is likely to have DKA secondary to severe pancreatitis. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and electrolyte imbalances is necessary.
3. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be prerenal in etiology. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for dialysis.
4. Respiratory status: The patient is tachypneic and at risk for developing ARDS and severe pulmonary complications due to mildly severe pancreatitis.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Close monitoring and aggressive repletion of electroly"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no previous history of diabetes who was
   transferred from OSH for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No alcohol history. No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S
   and LFTs normal. Has been aggressively volume resuscitated
 21L
   positive for LOS. Given negative CT scan for necrosis no indication to
   consider antibiotics at this point, although if spikes fever would
   consider rescanning and starting abx.
   - aggressively rehydrated, had signs of volume overload clinically, on
   lasix drip.
   - [**Doctor First Name 91**] following along; no surgical interventions indicated at this
   time.
   - place post-pyloric feeding tube today and start tube feeds vs. PO
   trial pending final surgery recs
   - no reimaging at this time, consider if he spikes; abx if hemodynamics
   / fever curve changes
   - Triglycerides -> mildly elevated
   - abdominal U/S -> Limited study, no obvious intrahepatic ductal
   dilation; If LFTs/Lipase increase, recheck U/S
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis on top of likely T2DM given
   HbAlc of 10.9.  Gap has normalized at 8 today with aggressive volume
   resuscitation. Insulin gtt at 3U/hr today.
   - AG closed, continuing insulin gtt and D10 (switched from D5 to reduce
   fluid intake given volume overload on exam)
   - q2H FSG's
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - Plan for transition to SQ insulin once post-pyloric dobhoff is placed
   and pt has steady carbohydrate intake.
   - Obtain [**Last Name (un) 72**] consult.
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: Likely prerenal in etiology. Cr
   continuing to trend downward. UOP at goal at this time on lasix drip
   - Continue lasix drip.
   - Monitor electrolytes while on lasix.
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer.
   - tachypnea improved today.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: improving
   - Acidemia: follow ABG
   - Trend phosphate as well, aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation
   - still with pain, pt unable to physically use PCA; will give morphine
   boluses PRN instead
   .
   #. HTN: BP meds held until today but BP trending upwards. Holding home
   Diovan/HCTZ given renal failure.
   - Start Amlodipine 5mg today.
   .
   #. Ileus: No BM since admission; likely due to NPO status and narcotics
   for pain
   - Colace, Senna, enema x1
   - Check KUB
   .
   #. Conjunctivitis: Left Eye
   - Erythromycin ointment QID, started [**2134-4-6**].
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's. Plan for post-pyloric tube feeds vs. PO trial pending
   surgery recs and Dobhoff placement.
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with heparin SQ
   -Stress ulcer with Famotidine
   .
   ACCESS: PICC, one PIV, A Line
   - Pull A-line today.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of no previous diabetes who was transferred from another hospital for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been aggressively volume resuscitated with 21 liters of fluids. He is currently on a lasix drip to manage volume overload and has been rehydrated. The pancreatitis appears to be mild without any ductal dilation on CT scan or ultrasound. There are no surgical interventions indicated at this time.

The patient's DKA is likely secondary to severe pancreatitis on top of likely type 2 diabetes mellitus given a hemoglobin A1c of 10.9. The gap has normalized at 8 today with aggressive volume resuscitation. Insulin gtt at 3U/hr today.

The patient also has acute oliguric renal failure, which is likely prerenal in etiology. The creatinine level is continuing to trend downward. The patient's urine output is at goal on the lasix drip.

The patient's respiratory status shows tachypnea, which has improved today. The patient is on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and may have a likelihood of manifesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe pulmonary complications given mildly severe pancreatitis.

The patient's acidemia and electrolytes are improving. The patient's pain control is still an issue, as he is unable to use the patient"

   MICU Intern Addendum:
   Patient seen and examined with MSIV and MICU team.  Please see
   excellent MSIV note above for further details.  Briefly, patient is a
   52 yo M who presented with pancreatitis and DKA which are continuing to
   resolve.  Patient remains on insulin gtt and D10W for carbohydrate
   source as not yet taking POs.  FS 79-164 over last 24H on 4units
   insulin per hour.  Awaiting surgery recs for post-pyloric tube
   placement vs. PO feeding.  WBC and lipase cont. to trend downward.
   Patient continues to have some abdominal discomfort.  Cont. morphine
   boluses.  Will check a KUB.  Increase bowel regimen.
   Renal failure improving with diuresis.  On lasix gtt.  Goal
 2 to 3L
   per day.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated and is currently on a lasix drip for fluid overload. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has mild severe pancreatitis, which puts him at risk for developing ARDS due to severe pulmonary complications.
2. Infection: Given the presence of a nasogastric tube, central line, and potential for immobility, the patient is at risk for developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been trending upwards, indicating a possible risk of hypotension, especially when considering the ongoing use of diuretics.
4. Hyperglycemia: Although the patient is currently on insulin gtt, there is still a risk of hyperglycemia due to the ongoing stress of illness and potential insulin resistance.
5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has an ileus, likely due to NPO status and narcotics for pain control. There is a need to monitor bowel movements and ensure proper bowel regimen.
6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has been aggressively rehydrated, and ongoing monitoring"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history of acute pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient was admitted for further management of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. 

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Acute pancreatitis: The cause of pancreatitis is unclear, but it could be related to medications, hypertriglyceridemia (mildly elevated), a stone, or a viral infection. There is no history of alcohol abuse, and the CT scan showed no ductal dilation or necrosis. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated and is being closely monitored for any signs of infection or complications.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient likely had DKA due to severe pancreatitis on top of likely T2DM, as indicated by a HbA1c level of 11.9. The gap has normalized, and the patient has been started on long-acting insulin (Lantus) subcutaneously at a dose of 50mg qHS, along with an insulin infusion at 2U/hr. The patient will likely need insulin after discharge until endocrine pancreatic function returns.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a medical history significant for acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and was found to have elevated blood glucose levels, indicating diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 

Upon admission, the patient was aggressively rehydrated, and insulin was started to manage the DKA. The patient's blood glucose levels have been trending downward, and he is now on a basal-bolus insulin regimen consisting of Lantus subcutaneously at bedtime and regular insulin through an IV infusion.

The patient's acute pancreatitis appears to be mild without evidence of necrosis on imaging. He has been aggressively volume-resuscitated, and his renal function is improving, as indicated by decreasing creatinine levels.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. His pain is being managed with morphine, as he is unable to use patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).

Other issues addressed include the patient's hypertension, ileus, conjunctivitis, gout, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention.

The patient's current medications include furosemide, insulin, famotidine, and heparin sodium. He is expected to require insulin for the foreseeable future until his pancreatic beta cell function recovers."

The patient is a 72-year-old with a chief complaint of arterial line stoppage. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including acute pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure. The patient's pain management and glycemic control are being monitored closely. The patient has a history of diabetes and requires insulin for management. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/78 to 143/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,460 mL and output of 5,725 mL over 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of -4,265 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including furosemide, insulin, famotidine, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, glucose levels, and lactate levels. The patient's abdominal X-ray from [**2134-4-3**] shows no air-fluid levels. The patient's arterial line was pulled, and a Dobhoff placement was unsuccessful due to agitation. The patient had a large bowel movement overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no previous history of diabetes who was transferred to the ICU for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated and is currently on a lasix drip for signs of volume overload. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with frequent ABG measurements to track acid-base balance, electrolyte trends, and renal function. The patient's pain control has been managed with fentanyl and morphine, as the patient is unable to use PCA. The patient's ileus has improved with the administration of bisacodyl PR, resulting in a large bowel movement. The patient's hypertension has been managed with Amlodipine, and the patient's conjunctivitis has been treated with erythromycin ointment. The patient's gout has been managed by holding colchicine in the setting of acute renal failure. The patient's nutritional needs have been met through IVF's and planned post-pyloric tube feeds or PO trial pending surgery recommendations and Dobhoff placement. Prophylactic measures include DVT ppx with heparin SQ and stress ulcer ppx with famotidine.

   transferred from OSH for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #.Ileus: No BM until HD6 with colace/senna/bisacodyl PR. Likely
   multifactorial etiology due to pancreatitis, fluid overload, narcotic
   pain medications. KUB [**4-6**] showed multiple dilated loops of small bowel
   w/ retained contrast but no air/fluid levels, read as Ileus vs. early
   obstruction. Also with bilious emesis today and [**11-13**] abdominal pain,
   no peritoneal signs.
   - NG Tube to suction
   - Strict NPO, including medications.
   - Repeat KUB. Consider Abd CT.
   - Serial ABD exams.
   - Appreciate surgery recs.
   - Consider TPN as patient has been NPO x 6 days and will likely not
   progress to PO intake for several more days.
   - Avoid narcotic pain medications if possible.
   - Colace [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No alcohol history. No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S
   and LFTs normal. Has been aggressively volume resuscitated
 18.9 L
   positive for LOS. Given negative CT scan for necrosis no indication to
   consider antibiotics at this point, although if spikes fever would
   consider rescanning and starting abx. Failed post-pyloric Dobhoff
   placement due to agitation.  Aggressively rehydrated, responded well to
   lasix drip.
   - D/C lasix drip. Start Lasix Bolus 40mg IV prn for goal I/O -1 to 2L
   today.
   - [**Doctor First Name 91**] following along; no surgical interventions indicated at this
   time.
   - If spikes, consider reimaging and abx.
   - If LFTs/Lipase increase, recheck U/S
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding. Stable since admission.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis on top of likely T2DM given
   HbAlc of 11.9.  Gap has normalized. Seen by [**Last Name (un) 72**] consult [**4-6**] and
   started on qHS lantus SQ. Insulin gtt at 2U/hr today. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 72**], pt
   will likely need insulin after discharge until endocrine pancreatic
   function returns.
   - AG closed, continuing insulin gtt and D10 (switched from D5 to reduce
   fluid intake given volume overload on exam)
   - 50U SC lantus qHS + insulin gtt
   - q2H FSG's
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - If TPN starts today, will add insulin to TPN.
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: Likely prerenal in etiology. Cr
   continuing to trend downward. UOP consistently high on lasix drip
   - Lasix bolus for I/O goal -1 to 2L today.
   - Monitor electrolytes while on lasix.
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer. Tachypnea continues today,
   likely due to pain.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: Acidemia improved.
   - Acidemia: follow ABG/VBG
   - Trend phosphate w/ aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation and morphine boluses
   for admission.
   - Avoid narcotics today pending surgery recs as likely are contributing
   to ileus.
   .
   #. HTN: BP meds held until today but BP trending upwards. Holding home
   Diovan/HCTZ given renal failure. Gave Amlodipine 5mg yesterday but will
   hold today as has constipating side effect.
   - Continue to monitor BP and adjust regimen if hypertensive.
   .
   #. Conjunctivitis: Left Eye
   - Erythromycin ointment QID, started [**2134-4-6**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no previous history of diabetes, who was transferred to the ICU for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Upon admission, the patient was found to have multiple dilated loops of small bowel with retained contrast but no air/fluid levels, indicating ileus. The patient also had elevated white blood cell count and lipase levels, consistent with acute pancreatitis. 

The patient's condition has been managed with aggressive volume resuscitation, strict NPO status, and the use of lasix to promote diuresis. The patient's blood glucose levels have been closely monitored and controlled with insulin therapy. The patient's renal function has improved, with a decreasing trend in creatinine levels. 

The patient's respiratory status has been stable, with the use of supplemental oxygen as needed. Pain control has been managed with the use of fentanyl and morphine. 

The patient's electrolyte imbalances have been addressed, including the repletion of potassium and phosphate levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient's abdominal pain, bilious emesis, and lack of bowel movement suggest the possibility of ileus. Further evaluation with a repeat KUB and consideration of an abdominal CT scan is recommended.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated white"

The patient is an elderly male with a medical history of diabetes and pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acidosis, and acute renal failure. The patient has been receiving various medications including insulin, furosemide, famotidine, and morphine sulfate. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/78 mmHg to 143/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,460 mL and output of 5,725 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 4,265 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of glucose, amylase, lipase, lactate, and LDH, with low levels of albumin and potassium. The patient's pain is being managed, and he is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of invasive lines and catheters.

   transferred from OSH for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #.Ileus: No BM until HD6 with colace/senna/bisacodyl PR. Likely
   multifactorial etiology due to pancreatitis, fluid overload, narcotic
   pain medications. KUB [**4-6**] showed multiple dilated loops of small bowel
   w/ retained contrast but no air/fluid levels, read as Ileus vs. early
   obstruction. Also with bilious emesis today and [**11-13**] abdominal pain,
   no peritoneal signs.
   - NG Tube to suction
   - Strict NPO, including medications.
   - Repeat KUB. Consider Abd CT.
   - Serial ABD exams.
   - Appreciate surgery recs.
   - Consider TPN as patient has been NPO x 6 days and will likely not
   progress to PO intake for several more days.
   - Avoid narcotic pain medications if possible.
   - Colace [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No alcohol history. No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S
   and LFTs normal. Has been aggressively volume resuscitated
 18.9 L
   positive for LOS. Given negative CT scan for necrosis no indication to
   consider antibiotics at this point, although if spikes fever would
   consider rescanning and starting abx. Failed post-pyloric Dobhoff
   placement due to agitation.  Aggressively rehydrated, responded well to
   lasix drip.
   - D/C lasix drip. Start Lasix Bolus 40mg IV prn for goal I/O -1 to 2L
   today.
   - [**Doctor First Name 91**] following along; no surgical interventions indicated at this
   time.
   - If spikes, consider reimaging and abx.
   - If LFTs/Lipase increase, recheck U/S
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding. Stable since admission.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis on top of likely T2DM given
   HbAlc of 11.9.  Gap has normalized. Seen by [**Last Name (un) 72**] consult [**4-6**] and
   started on qHS lantus SQ. Insulin gtt at 2U/hr today. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 72**], pt
   will likely need insulin after discharge until endocrine pancreatic
   function returns.
   - AG closed, continuing insulin gtt and D10 (switched from D5 to reduce
   fluid intake given volume overload on exam)
   - 50U SC lantus qHS + insulin gtt
   - q2H FSG's
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - If TPN starts today, will add insulin to TPN.
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: Likely prerenal in etiology. Cr
   continuing to trend downward. UOP consistently high on lasix drip
   - Lasix bolus for I/O goal -1 to 2L today.
   - Monitor electrolytes while on lasix.
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer. Tachypnea continues today,
   likely due to pain.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue fluids and monitor
   .
   #. Acidemia/Electrolytes: Acidemia improved.
   - Acidemia: follow ABG/VBG
   - Trend phosphate w/ aggressive repletion
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation and morphine boluses
   for admission.
   - Avoid narcotics today pending surgery recs as likely are contributing
   to ileus.
   .
   #. HTN: BP meds held until today but BP trending upwards. Holding home
   Diovan/HCTZ given renal failure. Gave Amlodipine 5mg yesterday but will
   hold today as has constipating side effect.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of acute pancreatitis, oliguric acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving aggressive volume resuscitation. The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), regular insulin, famotidine (Pepcid), and morphine sulfate. He also has prophylactic heparin sodium for DVT and stress ulcer prevention with IV famotidine. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, blood pressure ranging from 131/78 mmHg to 143/89 mmHg, heart rate between 100-116 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for nausea and bilious emesis.

The patient has been noted to have multiple dilated loops of small bowel with retained contrast on a KUB study, suggesting ileus. He is also experiencing abdominal pain, and a repeat KUB and abdominal CT scan have been ordered. The patient is on strict NPO status, and a TPN plan is being considered due to his prolonged NPO status.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and glucose levels. His potassium, calcium, and phosphorus levels are within normal limits. The patient's liver function tests are slightly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DKA, acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure.
- He has been aggressively volume resuscitated with 18.9 liters of fluids.
- The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but there is worsening distention of the large and small bowel and stomach.
- No nasogastric tube (NGT) has been placed, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has not been started.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range, and he has been transitioned from IV insulin to subcutaneous insulin (SC ISS).
- His creatinine levels have improved since admission, and he has been successfully transitioned off the lasix drip to bolus lasix.
- The patient is at risk of developing complications such as ileus, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe pulmonary complications, and further deterioration of renal function.
- He is also at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hyperglycemia due to inadequate pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient's worsening distention of the large and small bowel and stomach suggests the possibility of ileus. This can be confirmed by imaging studies such as a CT scan of the abdomen.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's t"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no previous history of diabetes who was
   transferred from OSH for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #.Ileus: No BM until HD6 with colace/senna/bisacodyl PR. Likely
   multifactorial etiology due to pancreatitis, fluid overload, narcotic
   pain medications. KUB [**4-6**] showed multiple dilated loops of small bowel
   w/ retained contrast but no air/fluid levels, read as Ileus vs. early
   obstruction. One episode bilious emesis on [**5-7**] w/ [**11-13**] abd pain, no
   peritoneal signs. Repeat KUB - Worsening distention of the large and
   small bowel and stomach. No NGT placed. No TPN per surgery. Pain
   significantly improved.
   - Strict NPO, including medications.
   - Serial ABD exams.
   - Surgery following
   - Consider TPN as patient has been NPO x 6 days and will likely not
   progress to PO intake for several more days.
   - Avoid narcotic pain medications if possible.
   - Colace [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No alcohol history. No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S
   and LFTs normal. Has been aggressively volume resuscitated
 18.9 L
   positive for LOS. Given negative CT scan for necrosis no indication to
   consider antibiotics at this point, although if spikes fever would
   consider rescanning and starting abx. Failed post-pyloric Dobhoff
   placement due to agitation.  Aggressively rehydrated, responded well to
   lasix drip.
   - D/C lasix drip. Start Lasix Bolus 40mg IV prn for goal I/O -1 to 2L
   today.
   - [**Doctor First Name 91**] following along; no surgical interventions indicated at this
   time.
   - If spikes, consider reimaging and abx.
   - If LFTs/Lipase increase, recheck U/S
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding. Stable since admission.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis on top of likely T2DM given
   HbAlc of 11.9.  Gap has normalized. Seen by [**Last Name (un) 72**] consult [**4-6**] and
   started on qHS lantus SQ. Insulin gtt d/c
d on [**5-7**] and pt transitioned
   to SC ISS, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**]. [**Name (NI) 72**], pt will likely need insulin after
   discharge until endocrine pancreatic function returns.
   - AG closed, continuing D10 and ISS.
   - q2h FS w/ q6h sliding scale insulin
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - If TPN started can add 30U insulin to TPN.
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: Likely prerenal in etiology. Cr
   improved since admission. UOP adequate. Transitioned off lasix drip to
   bolus lasix yesterday, to meet I/O goal
 1.5L today.
   - Continue lasix bolus 40mg IV prn for goal
   - Monitor Cr and electrolyes while on lasix.
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer. Tachypnea continues today,
   likely due to pain.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue fluids and monitor.
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation and morphine boluses
   on admission.
   - Avoid narcotics today pending surgery recs as likely are contributing
   to ileus.
   .
   #. HTN: BP meds held until today but BP trending upwards. Holding home
   Diovan/HCTZ given renal failure. Gave Amlodipine 5mg yesterday but will
   hold today as has constipating side effect.
   - Continue to monitor BP and adjust regimen if hypertensive.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes who was admitted to the ICU for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. 

The patient has shown improvement in his condition, with improved pain control and better fluid balance. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ileus: The patient has been experiencing an ileus, which is a temporary cessation of bowel motility. This can lead to abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. The patient's recent imaging showed multiple dilated loops of small bowel with retained contrast, but no air/fluid levels. Surgery is considering the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) to decompress the stomach and relieve symptoms.

2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas. The cause of pancreatitis is unclear, but it could be due to medications, hypertriglyceridemia, gallstones, or viral infection. The patient's pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) are elevated, indicating ongoing inflammation. Monitoring of the patient's condition and close observation for any signs of complications such as necrosis or infection is important.

3. Acute Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient has acute oliguric renal failure, characterized by decreased urine output. This condition is likely pre"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with no previous history of diabetes who was
   transferred from OSH for further management of DKA, acute pancreatitis,
   and oliguric acute renal failure.
   .
   #.Ileus: No BM until HD6 with colace/senna/bisacodyl PR. Likely
   multifactorial etiology due to pancreatitis, fluid overload, narcotic
   pain medications. KUB [**4-6**] showed multiple dilated loops of small bowel
   w/ retained contrast but no air/fluid levels, read as Ileus vs. early
   obstruction. One episode bilious emesis on [**5-7**] w/ [**11-13**] abd pain, no
   peritoneal signs. Repeat KUB - Worsening distention of the large and
   small bowel and stomach. No NGT placed. No TPN per surgery. Pain
   significantly improved.
   - Strict NPO, including medications.
   - Serial ABD exams.
   - Surgery following
   - Consider TPN as patient has been NPO x 6 days and will likely not
   progress to PO intake for several more days.
   - Avoid narcotic pain medications if possible.
   - Colace [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   #. Acute pancreatitis: Unclear precipitant.  ?[**3-8**] to medications,
   hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), stone that passed or viral
   infection.  No alcohol history. No ductal dilation by CT scan or U/S
   and LFTs normal. Has been aggressively volume resuscitated
 18.9 L
   positive for LOS. Given negative CT scan for necrosis no indication to
   consider antibiotics at this point, although if spikes fever would
   consider rescanning and starting abx. Failed post-pyloric Dobhoff
   placement due to agitation.  Aggressively rehydrated, responded well to
   lasix drip.
   - D/C lasix drip. Start Lasix Bolus 40mg IV prn for goal I/O -1 to 2L
   today.
   - [**Doctor First Name 91**] following along; no surgical interventions indicated at this
   time.
   - If spikes, consider reimaging and abx.
   - If LFTs/Lipase increase, recheck U/S
   - [**Last Name (un) **] score: 1% predicted mortality by [**Last Name (un) **] criteria at OSH.
   - Monitor ionized calcium
 at risk of precipitating calcium.
   - Trend CBC for bleeding. Stable since admission.
   .
   #. DKA: Likely [**3-8**] to severe pancreatitis on top of likely T2DM given
   HbAlc of 11.9.  Gap has normalized. Seen by [**Last Name (un) 72**] consult [**4-6**] and
   started on qHS lantus SQ. Insulin gtt d/c
d on [**5-7**] and pt transitioned
   to SC ISS, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**Last Name (un) 72**]. [**Name (NI) 72**], pt will likely need insulin after
   discharge until endocrine pancreatic function returns.
   - AG closed, continuing D10 and ISS.
   - q2h FS w/ q6h sliding scale insulin
   - replete K+ in IVF
   - If TPN started can add 30U insulin to TPN.
   .
   #. Acute oliguric renal failure: Likely prerenal in etiology. Cr
   improved since admission. UOP adequate. Transitioned off lasix drip to
   bolus lasix yesterday, to meet I/O goal
 1.5L today.
   - Continue lasix bolus 40mg IV prn for goal
   - Monitor Cr and electrolyes while on lasix.
   - hold colchicine for renal failure, and renally dose all medications
   .
   #. Respiratory status: Tachypnea, on 2L NC at time of transfer, but
   some likelihood of manifesting ARDS and severe pulmonary complications
   given mildly severe pancreatitis.  tachypnea and tachycardia likely [**3-8**]
   to inadequate pain control on transfer. Tachypnea continues today,
   likely due to pain.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   - Continue fluids and monitor.
   .
   #. Pain Control: Received fentanyl on presentation and morphine boluses
   on admission.
   - Avoid narcotics today pending surgery recs as likely are contributing
   to ileus.
   .
   #. HTN: BP meds held until today but BP trending upwards. Holding home
   Diovan/HCTZ given renal failure. Gave Amlodipine 5mg yesterday but will
   hold today as has constipating side effect.
   - Continue to monitor BP and adjust regimen if hypertensive.
   .
   #. Conjunctivitis: Left Eye
   - Erythromycin ointment QID, started [**2134-4-6**].
   .
   #. Gout: hold colchicine in setting of ARF.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF's. Strict NPO for now. Will revisit TPN vs. PPN with
   surgery today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with chief complaints of DKA, pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. They have shown worsening distention in the abdomen but improved abdominal pain. The patient's insulin dosage was increased, and the IV drip was stopped. The patient was switched from IV drip to bolus lasix. No TPN started per surgery. The patient's allergies are not known. Antibiotics were given at the last dose. The patient received several medications, including famotidine, furosemide, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/80 to 140/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's fluid balance showed a net loss of 1,755 mL. The patient was on nasal cannula oxygen delivery with an ABG result of /35. The physical examination revealed peripheral vascular issues, unassessed skin, and neurologic assessment not performed. Lab results indicated elevated levels of potassium (401 K/uL), low bicarbonate (20 mg/dL), high BUN (73 mg/dL), and creatinine (2.6). Other lab results showed elevated WBC count (15.4), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct 28.7), and elevated platelet count (Plt [**Telephone/Fax (3) 5033**]01). The patient's glucose levels were mostly within normal range. Other lab values indicated elevated liver enzymes, abnormal electrolyte levels, and elevated lactate levels. The patient was diagnosed with electrolyte and fluid disorder, nausea/vomiting, ineffective coping, pain control, DKA, pancreatitis, acidosis, renal failure, and ineffective pain management. The patient is under ICU care, receiving nutrition and glycemic control, with multiple lines inserted, including a PICC line. Prophylaxis measures were taken for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of multiple lines, including a PICC line, and the use of nasogastric tubes.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, especially with limited mobility in the ICU setting.
3. Stress Ulcer: The patient may be at risk of developing stress ulcers due to the presence of DKA and pancreatitis.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of the nasal cannula oxygen delivery device increases the risk of developing VAP.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen if not properly managed.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's acute pancreatitis may progress and lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.
7. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): If not adequately managed, the patient may experience further complications related to DKA, such as cerebral edema or hypoglycemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, who was transferred to the ICU for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated and required lasix diuresis. He is currently on IV bolus lasix and has good urine output. His pain has improved, and he is now able to tolerate oral intake. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, amylase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos). His blood glucose levels have been well-controlled with insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient has had no bowel movement since hospital day 6, and a CT scan showed multiple dilated loops of small bowel with retained contrast but no air/fluid levels, read as ileus vs. early obstruction. The patient also had an episode of bilious emesis and abdominal pain. Repeat CT scan showed worsening distention of the large and small bowel and stomach. The patient is now NPO (nothing by mouth), and serial abdominal exams are being performed. A follow-up CT abdomen will be obtained for a final read, and surgery will be consulted. The patient should avoid narcotic pain medications if possible, and encouraged to mobilize out of bed (OOB) and use a pressure-relieving device (PT) to prevent pressure ulcers.

2. Acute pancreatitis: The cause of the pancreatitis is unclear, but it may be due to medications, hypertriglyceridemia (only mildly elevated), a stone that passed, or a viral infection. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated and required lasix diuresis. He has been rehydrated and required lasix drip diuresis. The patient's amylase and lipase levels are elevated. If the patient spikes fever, antibiotics may be considered, and a repeat CT scan may be done. The patient's Alk Phos level is also elevated, and rechecking today is recommended. A repeat RUQ ultrasound may be considered if there is concern for biliary obstruction.

3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's DKA was likely exacerbated by severe pancreatitis on top of likely type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) given his HbA1c level of 11.9. His gap has normalized. He was seen by a consult physician and started on long-acting insulin (lantus) subcutaneously at bedtime. The patient's insulin gtt drip was discontinued, and he transitioned to subcutaneous insulin sliding scale (ISS). The patient will likely need insulin after discharge until his endocrine pancreatic function returns.

4. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely prerenal"

The patient is a 52-year-old male with no previous history of diabetes who was transferred to the ICU for further management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), acute pancreatitis, and oliguric acute renal failure. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated and required lasix diuresis. Insulin therapy has been initiated, and the patient will likely need insulin after discharge until endocrine pancreatic function returns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient has had multiple dilated loops of small bowel with retained contrast but no air/fluid levels, read as ileus vs. early obstruction. The patient's pain has improved today.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: The cause of pancreatitis is unclear, but it could be related to medications, hypertriglyceridemia, a stone, or viral infection. The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated, and antibiotics are not currently indicated. Surgical interventions are not indicated at this time.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's DKA likely occurred due to severe pancreatitis on top of likely type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's HbA1c level is 11.9. Insulin therapy has been initiated, and the patient will likely need insulin after discharge.
4. Acute Oliguric Renal Failure: The cause of renal failure is likely prerenal in etiology. The patient's creatinine level has improved"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute pancreatitis. The patient has shown improvement in symptoms such as nausea and abdominal distention. The patient has successfully transitioned from intravenous insulin to subcutaneous dosing.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. DKA: Despite the patient's improvement, there is still a risk of recurrent DKA, especially if the patient is unable to tolerate oral intake due to ileus or if there is inadequate glycemic control.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen or develop complications like necrosis or abscess formation. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.

3. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures like low molecular weight heparin are being taken, but regular monitoring for signs of DVT is essential.

5. Nausea and Abdominal Distention: The patient's symptoms may persist or recur, potentially indicating ongoing issues with ileus or other gastrointestinal complications.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension"
