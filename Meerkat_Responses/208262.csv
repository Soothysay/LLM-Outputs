","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted on [**11-29**] with shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. A CT scan showed septal and ground glass opacities, raising the possibility of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) or pulmonary edema, as well as a mass lesion in the left central airways. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with right pneumothorax and subsequent hypoxia. She was transferred to the MICU for overnight monitoring.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia - The patient's hypoxia is multifactorial, including emphysema at baseline, potential opportunistic infection (treated with levo since admit, bactrim from [**11-30**] to [**12-3**] after pcp r/o), and now with right pneumothorax and chest tube in place since [**2-26**], which may lead to barotrauma. The plan is to keep O2 sats between 90-93%. The chest tube should be on suction at -20 overnight, with a water seal at 5 am. A chest X-ray is scheduled for 9 am, followed by follow-up CXRs. An ABG will be done in the morning to assess pCO2 levels. Levofloxacin will be continued to complete a presumptive"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) on R-CHOP treatment.
- She was admitted on [11-29] with shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement.
- A CT scan showed septal and ground glass opacities, and there was a question of a mass lesion in the left central airways.
- The patient underwent a bronchoscopy for biopsy, resulting in right pneumothorax and hypoxia.
- Over the course of [12-6] to [12-7], the patient's condition improved.
- The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is multifactorial, including emphysema at baseline, possible infectious process (although BAL negative), and new left lower lobe (LLL) process that could be lymphoma.
- The patient had a small pleural effusion, but markedly improved with chest tube placement.
- Current plan: keep O2 sats between 90-93%, chest tube to remain clamped, follow-up CXR in the morning, and follow-up with interventional pulmonology regarding pigtail removal.
- Continue levofloxacin for a complete 10-day course, end [12-8].
- Hold Advair while receiving steroids and albuterol.
- Administer solumedrol 40mg three times a day for one day for stressor,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of DLBCL (Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma) who is currently undergoing R-CHOP chemotherapy. She was admitted on 11/29 with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. A CT scan revealed septal and ground glass opacities, and a question of a mass lesion in the left central airways. The patient underwent a bronchoscopic biopsy and right pulmonary thrombectomy, which improved her condition.

The patient is now experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is multifactorial. It could be due to emphysema at baseline, an infectious process (although BAL negative), or a new left lower lobe process possibly related to lymphoma. The patient has a pigtail chest tube in place, which has helped improve her condition.

The plan includes keeping the patient's O2 saturation between 90-93%, clamping the chest tube, and following up with a chest X-ray in the morning. The pigtail chest tube will be discussed with the interventional pulmonologist regarding removal. The patient will continue levofloxacin for a complete 10-day course, hold Adair while receiving steroids and albuterol, and resume prednisone 20mg qd after completing the solumedrol taper.

Other issues include anemia, likely caused by chemotherapy, and lymphoma, for which the oncology team will provide further"

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted to the ICU due to shortness of breath, fever, increased oxygen requirement, and findings of septal and ground glass opacities on a CT scan. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with right-sided pulmonary thrombosis (R-ptx) and was found to have a mass lesion in the left central airways. She was treated with levofloxacin and bactrim for possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and was given prednisone for stress. The patient's oxygen requirement has improved, and the chest tube was removed on [**12-7**]. The patient's current vitals include a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.5Â°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 144/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, platelet count of 322 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and glucose level of 90 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. The CT scan showed septal and ground glass opacities, raising suspicion of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) or pulmonary edema, as well as a possible mass lesion in the left central airways. She underwent bronchoscopic biopsy, resulting in right pneumothorax and hypoxia. She was then admitted to the MICU for overnight monitoring.

The patient's hypoxia is multifactorial, including emphysema at baseline, potential opportunistic infection (treated with levo since admission, and bactrim from 11/30 to 12/3 after ruling out PCP), and now with right pneumothorax and chest tube in place since 02/26. She has shown remarkable improvement in oxygen requirement, now requiring only 3 liters of oxygen near her home baseline.

The plan includes keeping oxygen saturation between 90-93%, clamping the chest tube to assess for pigtail catheter, following up with chest X-rays, continuing levofloxacin to complete the presumptive 10-day course, holding Advair while receiving steroids and albuterol, administering solumedrol 40mg three times a day for one day for stressor, then resuming prednisone 20mg once"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Upon admission, the patient was found to have a blood glucose level of 341 K/uL, which was significantly elevated. The patient was started on insulin infusions to manage the high blood sugar levels. 

Over the course of the next 24 hours, the patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.9 C (98.5 F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/56 to 119/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring showed an IV fluid intake of 1,945 mL, with an output of 1,405 mL through the urinary catheter. The patient received a total of 1,225 mL of IV fluids, with 720 mL given through the peripheral line and 505 mL given through the central line. 

The patient's blood products included 385 mL of packed red blood cells and 385 mL of fresh frozen plasma. The patient's urine output was 1,405 mL over the 24-hour period. 

The patient's respiratory support consisted of supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's ABG results showed a pH of 7.31. 

Physical examination findings included stable peripheral pulses, normal skin, and neurologic examination findings. 

Laboratory results showed a WBC count of 7.1 K/uL, Hct of 30.6%, platelet count of 322 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and glucose level of 90 mg/dL. Other lab values were within normal limits. 

The patient's medical plan included ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level was initially very high, and with the initiation of insulin infusions, there is a risk of hypoglycemia.
2. Fluid overload: The patient received a significant amount of IV fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath, fever, increased oxygen requirement, and a CT scan showing septal and ground glass opacities. She underwent bronchoscopy with right pneumothorax and improvement over time. The patient is currently on R-CHOP chemotherapy and has a history of emphysema. She now presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to an infectious process or lymphoma involvement in the left lower lobe. A pigtail chest tube was placed, resulting in marked improvement. The plan includes keeping O2 saturation between 90-93%, clamping the chest tube with follow-up chest X-ray, and discussing pigtail removal with the interventional pulmonologist. Levofloxacin will be continued until the end of its 10-day course. Advair will be held while receiving steroids and albuterol will be used instead. Solumedrol 40mg tid will be given for one day as a stressor before resuming prednisone 20mg qd as per the oncology team's recommendations. Anemia is present but no identifiable cause has been found, likely due to chemotherapy. Transfusion goal is to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) >25%. Guaiac stools will be checked.

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted on [11-29] with shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. A CT scan showed septal and ground glass opacities, and there was a question of a mass lesion in the left central airways. The patient underwent a bronchoscopic biopsy, right pneumothorax, and hypoxia. Her condition improved over the course of [12-6] into [12-7] and she underwent removal of the chest tube with resolution of the pneumothorax.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, multifactorial with emphysema at baseline, possibly an infectious process (although BAL negative) and a new left lower lobe process possibly related to lymphoma. She has undergone a rigid biopsy and then right pneumothorax with pigtail chest tube placement. The patient reported improved markedly with chest tube placement.

The plan includes keeping O2 sats between 90-93%, removing the chest tube, continuing levofloxacin to complete a presumptive 10-day course, holding Advair while receiving steroids and albuterol, administering prednisone 20 mg daily, addressing anemia, and following up on plans for lymphoma treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) admitted to the ICU with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. The patient underwent a bronchoscopic procedure for biopsy, resulting in right pneumothorax (ptx) and hypoxia. The patient's condition improved after the placement of a pigtail chest tube and removal of the ptx. The patient is currently hypoxemic due to multifactorial reasons, including emphysema, possible infectious process, and a new left lower lobe (LLL) process. The patient is scheduled for rigid bronchoscopy and pigtail chest tube placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's current hypoxemia may worsen due to underlying emphysema, potential infectious process, and the new LLL process. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and prompt intervention will be necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chemotherapy. Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion if necessary will be important to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
3. Lymphoma progression: The patient's lymphoma requires ongoing management, including chemotherapy and follow-up biopsies to monitor disease progression.
4. Infection: Despite negative BAL results, there is a possibility of an ongoing infectious process. Close monitoring of vital signs and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted with shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. A CT scan revealed septal and ground glass opacities, and there was a question of a mass lesion in the left central airways. The patient underwent a bronchoscopic biopsy and right pneumothorax, which improved over time. A pigtail chest tube was placed and later removed after resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient experienced an episode of desaturation with tachycardia, but a pulmonary embolism study was negative. She has an elevated 1,3 glucan level and her CT is more concerning for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The plan is to repeat induced sputum and not treat empirically at this time. The patient also has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, which could be consistent with an atypical presentation of pulmonary edema. However, diuresis on 12-8 resulted in hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure - multifactorial, possibly due to emphysema at baseline, infectious process (although BAL negative), and new left lower lobe (LLL) process (possibly lymphoma).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted on 11/29 with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. CT scan showed septal and ground glass opacities, and there was a question of a mass lesion in the left central airways. The patient underwent a bronchoscopic biopsy and right pneumothorax (ptx) with subsequent improvement. The patient also had a left lower lobe (LLL) process that was biopsied and found to be lymphoma-related. The patient received treatment with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and completed cycle 3. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, and lymphoma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's baseline emphysema, along with a possible infectious process and new LLL process, contributes to her hypoxemic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels between 90-93% is recommended.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia with no identifiable cause. It is likely due to chemotherapy. The goal is to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above 25% through transfusions.
3. Lymphoma: The patient has DLBCL, which"

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. Her CT scan showed septal and ground glass opacities, with a question of a mass lesion in the left central airways. She underwent bronchoscopy with rigid biopsy and received chest tube placement for pneumothorax, which has since been removed.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) being treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. She was admitted on 11/29 with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. A CT scan showed septal and ground glass opacities, raising suspicion of PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) or pulmonary edema, as well as a mass lesion in the left central airways. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with right pneumothorax and subsequent hypoxia. She was admitted to the MICU for oxygen monitoring.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's initial hypoxia was multifactorial, possibly due to emphysema at baseline, opportunistic infection (PCP), and barotrauma from the chest tube. The hypoxia has improved significantly since the removal of the chest tube and implementation of oxygen therapy.
2. Anemia: The patient has unexplained anemia, likely related to chemotherapy. Transfusion goals have been set with a target hematocrit (Hct) >25.
3. Lymphoma: The patient has a diagnosis of carcinoid tumor on biopsy, and the oncology team needs to address management recommendations. A follow-up biopsy from bronchoscopic samples is planned.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thromb"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient was switched to 20 mg prednisone daily, and Levaquin was stopped. The patient became desaturated in the 80s, so they were placed on non-rebreather (NRB) oxygen. A chest X-ray showed no pneumonia, and the patient received Lasix. The patient then became tachycardic, so they received a 500 cc bolus and the tachycardia resolved. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest was performed to rule out a pulmonary embolism (PE), which was found to be preliminary negative. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was elevated at 2436 with no prior measurements for comparison.

Allergies:
The patient has an allergy to Amoxicillin, causing facial swelling.

Infusions and Other Medications:
The patient received Furosemide (Lasix) at 02:59 PM.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of DLBCL (Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma) on R-CHOP treatment. She was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, increased oxygen requirement, and a CT scan showing septal and ground glass opacities. The patient underwent a bronchoscopic procedure for biopsy, resulting in right pneumothorax and hypoxia. She was admitted to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for oxygen monitoring. The patient has a history of emphysema and is currently on supplemental oxygen.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is multifactorial, including baseline emphysema, potential opportunistic infection, and barotrauma from chest tube placement. However, her oxygen requirement has improved significantly.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia with no identifiable cause. It is likely due to chemotherapy.
3. Lymphoma: The patient is undergoing R-CHOP treatment for DLBCL. Oncology recommendations and further biopsy results are pending.
4. Pneumonia Prophylaxis: The patient is on prophylactic antibiotics for pneumonia.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is on DVT prophylaxis due to her prolonged immobility in the ICU.
6. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who was admitted on [11-29] with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. A CT scan showed septal and ground glass opacities, raising suspicion of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) or pulmonary edema, as well as a mass lesion in the left central airways. She underwent a bronchoscopy with right pulmonary thrombectomy and has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for oxygen monitoring.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, which is multifactorial and may be due to emphysema at baseline, potential opportunistic infection (treated with levofloxacin since admission, and later switched to bactrim from [11-30] to [12-3] after ruling out PCP), right pneumothorax with chest tube placement on [2-26], and barotrauma, which was removed on [12-7]. Despite these complications, the patient has shown remarkable improvement in oxygen requirement and is now near her baseline of using 3 liters of oxygen.

A CT scan on [12-8] ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed worsening ground glass opacities in the upper field predominance. The patient has been on steroids without PCP prophylaxis and has elevated lactate dehydrogenase"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old male with worsening ground-glass opacities (GGO) on CT scan. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy to rule out Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), but no complications were noted during the procedure. The patient's medical history includes an allergy to amoxicillin, which caused facial swelling. The patient is currently receiving infusions and other ICU medications such as pantoprazole.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent worsening GGO on CT scan. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/65 mmHg to 123/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has an ABG result of ///32/. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -65 mL and -174 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has received a total of 735 mL and 450 mL of fluids since midnight.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 322 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and glucose level of 96 mg/dL. Other lab values include a PT of 11.5, PTT of 26.8, INR of 1.0, calcium level of 8.0 mg/dL, magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 1.9 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is under ICU care for close monitoring. The patient's nutritional needs are being met, and glycemic control is being maintained.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) on R-CHOP treatment. She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and increased oxygen requirement. A CT scan showed septal and ground glass opacities, which raised suspicion of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) or pulmonary edema. There was also a concern about a mass lesion in the left central airways, leading to a bronchoscopy for biopsy with right pneumothorax and subsequent hypoxia. The patient was transferred to the MICU for oxygen monitoring.

The patient's hypoxia is multifactorial, including emphysema at baseline, possible opportunistic infection (treated with levo since admission, and bactrim from 11/30 to 12/3 after PCP rule out), right pneumothorax with chest tube in place until 12/7, and now worsening ground glass opacities in the upper field predominance on CT. The patient has been on steroids without PCP prophylaxis and has elevated LDH levels.

Plan:
1. Maintain O2 sats between 90-93%.
2. Follow-up chest X-rays.
3. Stop levofloxacin on 12/8.
4. Discontinue Advair (patient on steroids and albuterol).
5. Administer prednisone 20"
