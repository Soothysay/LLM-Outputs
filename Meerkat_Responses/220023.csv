","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diastolic heart failure, and kidney transplant. She was admitted from Hospital1 with shortness of breath. 

During the night, the patient had low blood sugar levels, which were corrected with D50 and juice. Her blood sugar levels improved afterward. She received half of her lantus dose in the evening and felt much better, with improving shortness of breath.

The patient has allergies to codeine, amoxicillin, and adhesive tape. Her last dose of antibiotics was ranitidine, heparin sodium, and dextrose 50%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for shortness of breath. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/54 mmHg to 148/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals a well-dressed woman in no acute distress, oriented x3, with appropriate mood and affect. Her HEENT examination is normal, with pink conjunctiva and no pallor or cyanosis. Her neck is supple with a jugular venous pressure of 3 cm. Her cardiac examination shows a regular rate and rhythm,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diastolic heart failure, and kidney transplant. She presented with shortness of breath and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's recent blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, requiring interventions such as D50 and lantus insulin. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 123/54 mmHg and heart rate of 79 bpm. The patient's respiratory support includes an oxygen delivery device with a SpO2 of 94%. An echocardiogram showed systolic dysfunction in the inferolateral wall and decreased mitral regurgitation. The patient is on multiple medications including sirolimus, tacrolimus, metoprolol, nifedipine, lasix, lantus, and others for various conditions such as immune suppression, diabetes mellitus type I, renal disease, hypertension, depression, pain, insomnia, nausea, and osteoporosis. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, and prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS): The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, which may increase the risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diastolic heart failure, and kidney transplant. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath. The patient's current condition includes acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute pain, diabetes mellitus type I, coronary artery disease, and chronic diastolic heart failure. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed no changes from previous catheterization and no intervention was performed. The patient also has a small hematoma at the catheterization site with bilateral femoral bruits. She experienced flash pulmonary edema overnight and received 20 mg IV lasix in the morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her blood pressure is within normal range. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on medium concentration mask. The patient's heart rhythm is normal sinus rhythm. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute anemia secondary to blood loss: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased from 28.8 to 25.5, indicating acute blood loss. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and may require blood transfusion if the patient becomes symptomatic or if hemodynamic instability occurs.
2. Acute pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, which needs to be managed appropriately to provide comfort and prevent complications associated with uncontrolled pain.
3. Diabetes mellitus type I: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She also has diastolic heart failure and has received a kidney transplant. The patient presented from another hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have flash pulmonary edema. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 121/69 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a medium concentration mask. Her temperature is within normal limits at 36.9°C.

The physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs and a 4-5/6 holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. There is no evidence of jugular venous distension or peripheral edema. The patient's femoral catheter sites appear normal without signs of hematoma or infection.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, indicating anemia. The white blood cell count is within normal limits. Blood glucose levels are elevated, and electrolytes are within normal ranges. The creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may be due to acute pulmonary edema or the recent administration of lasix.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type I, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and a history"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diastolic heart failure, who presented with shortness of breath. She has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and kidney transplantation. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

24-hour events:
- The patient's femoral sheath was removed, and a hematoma was noted at the left femoral site. Bilateral femoral bruits were auscultated.
- Her hematocrit (HCT) dropped from 28.8 to 25.5, but she maintained her blood pressure and was not tachycardic. A decision was made not to transfuse due to a history of flash pulmonary edema.
- The patient's oxygen saturation (O2 sat) was 85%, which improved to 93% with the use of a non-rebreather mask (NRB). Crackles were heard on lung examination, and 20 mg of intravenous lasix was given.
- Allergies include codeine, amoxicillin, and adhesive tape.

Physical examination findings:
- General: Well-dressed woman in no apparent distress, oriented x3, with appropriate mood and affect.
- HEENT: Normal cat eyes, pink conjunctiva, and no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
- Neck: Supple with no elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP).

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a significant medical history including coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), diastolic heart failure, and kidney transplantation. She presented with shortness of breath from [Hospital1] and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have dropped from 28.8 to 25.5, indicating acute blood loss. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.

2. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient has reported both acute and chronic pain. Acute pain may be related to recent medical procedures or complications, while chronic pain could be due to underlying conditions such as osteoporosis or previous injuries. Proper pain management is crucial to prevent further complications and improve patient comfort.

3. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type I: The patient has a history of type I diabetes, which requires careful monitoring of blood glucose levels and insulin administration. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, both of which can cause various complications.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease: The patient's known CAD, for which she underwent CABG, indicates"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. However, the note provides information about various events that occurred within a 24-hour period. The patient had difficulty with IV access, so a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed. The femoral sheath was removed, and a hematoma was noted on the left femoral site. Bilateral femoral bruits were auscultated, but distal pulses were present. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) dropped from 28.8% to 25.5%, but they were hemodynamically stable and without signs of distress. A decision against transfusion was made due to a history of flash pulmonary edema. The patient's allergies include codeine, amoxicillin, adhesive tape, and unknown blood-group specific substance. They received ranitidine and heparin sodium infusions, as well as other medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/69 mmHg to 132/95 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD s/p CABG), diastolic heart failure, and kidney transplant. She was admitted from Hospital1 with shortness of breath. The patient's current condition includes acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute and chronic pain, type I diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic diastolic heart failure. She also has a history of kidney transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped significantly since admission, indicating acute anemia. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure and is currently experiencing an exacerbation. This can result in fluid accumulation, pulmonary congestion, and shortness of breath.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's CAD puts her at risk for further cardiac events such as angina, myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias.
4. Kidney Transplant Complications: As a transplant recipient, the patient is at risk for rejection, infection, and medication-related side effects.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type I diabetes, which requires careful monitoring of blood glucose levels to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Pain Management: The patient requires effective"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diastolic heart failure, and kidney transplant.
- She presented from Hospital1 with shortness of breath.
- The patient's current condition includes diastolic dysfunction, CHF exacerbation, and flash pulmonary edema.
- The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels but are otherwise within normal limits.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 143/75 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient is currently receiving various medications for her conditions, including lasix for diuretic purposes, metoprolol for heart rate control, nifedipine for blood pressure management, sirolimus and tacrolimus for immune suppression post-kidney transplant, Lantus and sliding scale insulin for diabetes management, and other medications for pain, insomnia, nausea, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload: The patient's history of CHF exacerbation and flash pulmonary edema indicates a risk for fluid overload. This can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's slightly elevated creatinine levels suggest a potential kidney dysfunction. This"
