   have seizure yesterday. Given ativan at the nursing home; was post
   ictal for 10 mins and question of left sided weakness. Admitted to
   neuro. Head CT negative. Electroytes were normal.
   Early this AM, paitent had cardiac arrest. Nursing did chest
   compression for one minute; HR reportedly 30. First blood pressure
   noted by physicians was 150 systolic and he had sinus brady with HR
   40-50. Patient intubated for agonal breathing. Was given atropine with

   Assessment and Plan
   CARDIAC ARREST
   ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAIULRE
   ANEMIA
   SEIZURE
   BARDYCADIA
   =================
   Patient with apparent bradycardic arrest; at worst pulse/BP absent for
   1 minute or less. Cause of arrest unclear, but vagal stimulus a
   consideration. Patient remains relatively bradycardic now, however,
   suggesting sinus nodal disease. Inferior ischemia also a consideration
   in light of ECG with possible old IMI. Patient has been on atenolol at
   the nursing home; possible that he received too much medication.
   Intracranial hypertension may cause bradycardia/hypertension, but CT
   was negative on admission. Deviation of eyes now suggest possible
   stroke. Would consider MRI/MRA. Patient also due for EEG. Obtain
   cardiac enzymes. Metabolic acidosis at time of arrest may be more
   indicative of seizure at the beginning of the arrest given that patient
   was not hyptensive for very long. Place transcutaneous pacer pads.
   Replete potassium.
   Patient somewhat hypertensive now. [**Month (only) 8**] be related to agitation. Will
   switch ventilator to PSV from assit control. If BP remains elevated,
   consider adding back his ACE inhibitor. Target BP would be 140-160
   sytolic. Avoid hypotension with possible CVA. [**Month (only) 8**] be able to extubate
   post MRI.
   Hct is down consistent with prior hx of anemia. No evidence of blood
   loss. Not at transfusion threshold.

","The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of cardiac arrest, bradycardia, seizure, acute respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), osteoporosis, prostate hypertrophy, and dementia. He lives in a nursing home.

The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated successfully. He had a seizure yesterday and was given ativan at the nursing home. He also had left-sided weakness postictal but a head CT was negative. His electrolytes were normal.

In the early morning, the patient had another cardiac arrest and was given atropine with improved heart rate. He was intubated for agonal breathing and transferred to the MICU where his blood pressure has been stable with good oxygen saturation.

ABG results showed a pH of 7.23/70/151 with lactate 8.6 during arrest and later in the morning, ABG: 7.45/45/191 on 50% oxygen with lactate < 2.

The patient has a history of smoking, consumes ethanol socially, and has allergies to no known drugs. He is unable to provide history as he is sedated and intubated.

His vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°C), heart rate of 60 (60-63) bpm, blood pressure of 196/75 (122) mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was admitted to the neurology service for a new onset seizure and later transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a bradycardic arrest. The patient has no previous history of seizures. His symptoms began with leftward eye deviation after eating breakfast, followed by generalized tonic-clonic activity. He received 1 mg of Ativan, which resulted in incontinence of bowel and bladder, although this is his baseline. The patient was post-ictal for approximately 10 minutes with minimal verbal output and there was a question of left-sided weakness at that time. A head CT was negative. On the evening of transfer, a Code Blue was called for asystole, but the patient's circulation returned spontaneously. The patient was intubated for agonal breathing, two peripheral IV lines and a left femoral line were placed, and he received 2 mg of Ativan without response. Atropine was given for bradycardia, and the patient's heart rate improved to the 70s. Blood pressure remained stable, and the ECG showed no ischemic changes. The patient is now in the MICU for further management.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment & Plan:  80y/o M with a PMH of CAD, HTN, PVD, COPD admitted
   to neurology service for new onset seizure now transferred to MICU
   following bradycardic arrest.
   .
   # Bradycardia - Pt had evidence of sinus bradycardia prior to becoming
   hypotensive. Currently with HR 40-50. No clear evidence of ischemia.
   Could consider additional causes of bradycardia including neurologic,
   sick sinus syndrome, metabolic (lytes currently WNL), medication
   overdose (atenolol).
   - Trend CE
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - Hold atenolol
   - Check TTE
   - Head imaging with MRI in am
   .
   # Seizure - Per neurology concern given for complex partial seizure
   with secondary generalization and subsequent mild [**Doctor Last Name 6180**] paralysis on
   admission. Pt was not on monitoring so it is unclear if seizure was an
   inciting event code blue
   - EEG in am
   - Head MRI/MRA in am
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - continue midazolam for sedation
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - PCO2 70 in the setting of
   bradycardia, low respiratory rate. Now resolved.
   - Will transition to PSV, RSBI in am
   - If MRI scheduled for early am, plan to extubate following imaging
   study
   .
   # CAD - unclear history of CAD
   - CE neg [**Name (NI) 4918**]
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - Obtain TTE
   .
   # COPD - Per report Pt has a history of COPD, had evidence of CO2
   retention during Code blue event however this was most likely secondary
   to decreased respiratory rate in setting of seizure vs bradycardic
   event
   .
   # FEN - NPO for now, replete K to 4 and Mg to 2

","Summary of Progress Note:
- An 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, HTN, PVD, and COPD admitted to the neurology service for new-onset seizure.
- Transferred to the MICU following a bradycardic arrest.
- The patient has a leftward eye deviation after eating breakfast, followed by generalized tonic-clonic activity.
- He was given Ativan, resulting in incontinence of bowel and bladder, which is his baseline.
- The patient is post-ictal with minimal verbal output and there is a question of left-sided weakness.
- Head CT was negative.
- The patient experienced a code blue in the evening with asystole, but returned spontaneously to normal circulation.
- He was intubated for agonal breathing and received Ativan without response.
- The patient's heart rate improved with the administration of atropine.
- He is now transferred to the MICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia prior to the hypotensive event, and currently has a heart rate of 40-50. Additional causes of bradycardia should be considered, including neurologic causes, sick sinus syndrome, metabolic imbalances (lytes are currently within normal limits), and medication overdose (atenolol).
2. Seizure: The patient presented with a new-onset seizure, and there is concern for a complex"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the neurology service for a new onset seizure and subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a bradycardic arrest. The patient lives in a nursing home and was found to have leftward eye deviation after eating breakfast this morning, followed by generalized tonic-clonic activity. He received 1 mg of Ativan, which resulted in incontinence of bowel and bladder, but this is his baseline. The patient was post-ictal for approximately 10 minutes with minimal verbal output and there was a question of left-sided weakness at this time.

Preliminary workup including a head CT was negative. On the evening of transfer, a Code Blue was called at around 2 am for asystole. Chest compressions were briefly administered prior to the code team arrival. The patient had bradycardia followed by asystole with spontaneous return of circulation. The patient was intubated for agonal breathing. Two peripheral IV lines and a left femoral line were placed. He received 2 mg of ativan without response. The patient was given 1 mg of atropine for bradycardia to a rate in the 30s with improvement in HR to the 70s. Blood pressure was stable throughout. ECG showed no ischemic changes. He is now transferred to the MICU for further management.

   .
   # Bradycardia - Pt had evidence of sinus bradycardia prior to becoming
   hypotensive. Currently with HR 40-50. No clear evidence of ischemia.
   Could consider additional causes of bradycardia including
   hypothyroidism (TSH 6.3)***, neurologic (such as ICP), associated with
   increased vagal tone, heightened parasympathetic, withdrawal sympa as
   with valsalva, micturition, cough, sick sinus syndrome, metabolic in
   particular K+ (lytes currently WNL), medication overdose (atenolol),
   donepezil.  Lactic acidosis to 8.6 resolved this am, perhaps during
   hypotension, may have underlying subclinical brady/hypotension, finally
   resulting in this episode. No leukocytosis, fever to invoke infection.
   - Trended CE: 1^st set 0.01 and no EKG changes
   - Repeat ECG this morning is unchanged.
   - Hold atenolol
   - Check TTE
   - Head imaging with MRI in am

   # Seizure - Per neurology concern given for complex partial seizure
   with secondary generalization and subsequent mild [**Doctor Last Name 6180**] paralysis on
   admission. Pt was not on monitoring so it is unclear if seizure was an
   inciting event code blue
   - EEG in am
   - Head MRI/MRA in am
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - continue midazolam for sedation

   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - PCO2 70 in the setting of
   bradycardia, low respiratory rate. Now resolved with gas this am of
   7.45, PCO2 of 45 from 7.23/70.
   -CXR y/d showed ? atelectasis vs fluid in fissure
   - Will transition to PSV, check  RSBI in am.
   - If MRI scheduled for early am, plan to extubate following imaging
   study.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the neurology service for new-onset seizure and subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a bradycardic arrest. The patient has been experiencing leftward eye deviation, generalized tonic-clonic activity, incontinence of bowel and bladder, and minimal verbal output. His previous medical history does not include any history of seizures. 

On transfer to the MICU, the patient received 1 mg of ativan without response. He was given 1 mg of atropine for bradycardia, which improved his heart rate to the 70s. The patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout, and his ECG showed no ischemic changes. He was intubated for agonal breathing and had arterial, multi-lumen, and peripheral IV lines placed. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 187/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

   COPD admitted to neurology service for new onset seizure now
   transferred to MICU following bradycardic arrest. Per admission note,
   the patient lives at a NH and was found to have leftward eye deviation
   after eating breakfast this am, followed by generalized tonic-clonic
   activity. Unclear duration of symptoms. He was given 1mg Ativan, was
   noted to have incontinence of bowel and bladder, however this is his
   baseline. Reported to be post-ictal for approx 10 minutes with minimal
   verbal output. There was question of L sided weakness at this time.
   There is no previous history of seizure.
   .
   He was admitted to neurology service with preliminary workup including
   Head CT negative. On the evening of transfer, Code Blue was called at
   approx. 2am for asystole. Chest compressions were briefly administered
   (~1min) prior to code team arrival. Per report the patient had
   bradycardia followed by asystole with spontaneous return of
   circulation. The patient was intubated for agonal breathing. 2PIV and L
   femoral line were placed. He received 2mg ativan without response. The
   patient was given 1mg atropine for bradycardia to rate of the 30s with
   improvement in HR to 70s. BP stable throughout. ECG without ischemic
   changes. He is now transferred to the MICU for further management.

   # Bradycardia - Pt had evidence of sinus bradycardia prior to becoming
   hypotensive. Currently with HR 40-50. No clear evidence of ischemia.
   Could consider additional causes of bradycardia including
   hypothyroidism (TSH 6.3)***, neurologic (such as ICP), associated with
   increased vagal tone, heightened parasympathetic, withdrawal sympa as
   with valsalva, micturition, cough, sick sinus syndrome, metabolic in
   particular K+ (lytes currently WNL), medication overdose (atenolol),
   donepezil.  Lactic acidosis to 8.6 resolved this am, perhaps during
   hypotension, may have underlying subclinical brady/hypotension, finally
   resulting in this episode. No leukocytosis, fever to invoke infection.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the neurology service for a new onset seizure and subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a bradycardic arrest. The patient's past medical history includes dementia, mood disorder, osteoporosis, anemia, and mild cognitive impairment. He lives in a nursing home and has a tobacco use history. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the seizure and bradycardic arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient had evidence of sinus bradycardia prior to becoming hypotensive, and his heart rate remains low (40-50 bpm). Additional causes of bradycardia should be considered, including hypothyroidism, neurologic causes (such as increased intracranial pressure), associated with increased vagal tone, heightened parasympathetic activity, medication overdose (atenolol), and sick sinus syndrome.

2. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure with secondary generalization, resulting in mild paralysis. An EEG and head MRI/MRA are planned to investigate the cause of the seizure.

3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient had elevated carbon dioxide levels (PCO2 70) in"

 BRADYCARDIA
   Patient with hypotension without evidence of aortic dissection. On exam
   has warm extremities with good capillary refill, which argues against
   low intravascular volume or cardiogenic shock. With fluids, BP now 110
   systolic and urine output improving. CVP now 20. Suspect that increase
   in antihypertensives may also have contributed to his low BP. WBC
   normal and patient afebrile with no apparent source of infection. ECG
   without evidence of acute ischemia. With elevated CVP and hypoxemia,
   would now begin to diurese gently. Patient has hardware in his back.
   Possibility of occult infection with nightsweats. Would obtain blood
   cultures but hold antibiotics for now.
   Acute renal failure worrisome for ATN with low BP. The amount of rise
   in creat from baseline suggests this process has been ongoing for
   several days. Urine Na, however, is low suggesting pre-renal azotemia.
   Monitor with improved volume status. Complete bicarb protocol for
   contrast he received.
   Elevated serum potassium probably related to acidosis and low urine
   output. Improving with volume resuscitation. Acidosis has anion gap
   probably related to renal failure.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of bradycardia and hypotension. They are currently on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen access. The patient has a history of seizure, dementia, and bradycardia. The vital signs show a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/67 to 187/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, as indicated by the rise in creatinine levels and low urine output. This could be due to pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring with improved volume status is recommended.

2. Hypotension: Despite fluid resuscitation, the patient's blood pressure remains low. This could be related to an increase in antihypertensives or other underlying causes. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of fluid and medication administration are necessary.

3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is below normal limits. It is important to assess for any underlying causes such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or cardiac dysfunction. Monitoring heart rhythm and adjusting medications if needed is crucial.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. They were admitted to the ICU and experienced bradycardia, hypotension, and an episode of tonic clonic seizure. The patient's medical history includes dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia. The patient is currently on various medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, and donepezil.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Bradycardia/Arrest: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may be due to post-ictal state, atenalol side effects, or sick sinus syndrome. It is important to closely monitor and manage these symptoms to prevent further complications.
2. Tonic Clonic Seizure: The patient experienced a new onset of tonic clonic seizure despite being on valproate (Depakote) for mood disorder. Further evaluation with head CT and MRI is planned, and EEG and neurologic follow-up are also necessary.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required a change in ventilator mode to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is currently doing well. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and adjusting ventilator settings as needed is essential.
4. Dementia: The patient's pre-existing dementia may exacerbate the overall clinical picture and impact their recovery. Monitoring mental status and providing appropriate care for dementia management is crucial.

   Disposition:ICU for now, to neuro
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a male with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and a seizure. The note mentions several potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and history.

1. Nutrition alteration: The patient may have an alteration in nutrition, which could be related to their recent respiratory failure and prolonged stay in the ICU.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, but it is not specified as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

3. History of seizure, with status epilepticus: The patient had a seizure, and it progressed to status epilepticus. Proper management and monitoring of the patient's seizure disorder is essential.

4. Dementia (including Alzheimer's, multi-infarct): The patient has dementia, which could be related to Alzheimer's disease or multiple small strokes. This condition requires ongoing medical management and support.

5. Bradycardia: The patient has low heart rate (bradycardia), which needs to be monitored and managed to ensure adequate cardiac function.

6. Abnormal blood gas values: The patient's blood gas values show a pH of 7.41, indicating a slightly alkalotic state. The pCO2 is 51 mmHg (elevated), the pO2 is 51 mmHg (low"

   # Bradycardia - Pt had evidence of sinus bradycardia prior to becoming
   hypotensive. Currently with HR 40-50. No clear evidence of ischemia.
   Could consider additional causes of bradycardia including
   hypothyroidism (TSH 6.3)***, neurologic (such as ICP), associated with
   increased vagal tone, heightened parasympathetic, withdrawal sympa as
   with valsalva, micturition, cough, sick sinus syndrome, metabolic in
   particular K+ (lytes currently WNL), medication overdose (atenolol),
   donepezil.  Lactic acidosis to 8.6 resolved this am, perhaps during
   hypotension, may have underlying subclinical brady/hypotension, finally
   resulting in this episode. No leukocytosis, fever to invoke infection.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the neurology service for new-onset seizures and subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a bradycardic arrest. The patient's current condition includes bradycardia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered nutrition, and possible dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's low heart rate may lead to inadequate cardiac output and reduced organ perfusion. Causes of bradycardia should be investigated, including hypothyroidism, neurologic causes, increased vagal tone, medication overdose (atenolol), sick sinus syndrome, and metabolic disturbances like potassium imbalance.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had elevated carbon dioxide levels due to hypoventilation. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent complications such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and multiorgan dysfunction.

3. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, which could be due to a variety of causes including complex partial seizures with secondary generalization or electrolyte imbalances. The underlying cause of the seizure needs to be identified and managed appropriately.

4. Altered Nutrition: The patient has altered nutrition status, which may contribute to poor wound healing, decreased"

   Pt has been brady down to 40
s on floor but mostly in 70s.
   TFTs wnl, does have degenerative changes on mri could have resulted in
   seizure activity with subsequent post ictal bradychardia in someone who
   at baseline may have some bradychardia.
    CE wnl, Echo shows severe dCHF but no valvular changes, no global wall
   motion abn accounting for brady.
   EKG showed some QT prolongation
   Repeat EKG
   - Hold atenolol
   # Seizure - Per neurology concern given for complex partial seizure
   with secondary generalization and subsequent mild [**Doctor Last Name 6180**] paralysis on
   admission. Pt was not on monitoring so it is unclear if seizure was an
   inciting event code blue.
   Pt has not had any further noted seizure activity,  EEG deferred thus
   far. Noted to be hypoglycemic, no prior hx DM, insulinoma, or oral
   hypoglycemics but hypoglycemia could cause seizures.
   - On anti-epileptic dose depakote in therapeutic range.
   -Check LFTs
   - Head MRI shows atrophy, degeneration ? NPH

   - continue midazolam for sedation as needed.
   -Dementia: Noted in records as mild however MRI suggests considerable
   disease
 Alzheimers vs NPH included in differential. Pt is
   occasionally agitated, but redirectable, oriented to person,
   disoriented to place/time. Communicate with [**Name (NI) **]/son to determine
   baseline MS.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - PCO2 70 in the setting of
   bradycardia, low respiratory rate. Post extubation, blood gases/O2 sat
   have remained wnl, O2 dropped slightly, PCO2 increased slightly,  in am
   in setting of receiving sedatives for agitation.
   CXR this am showed blurring of hemidiaphrams bilaterally, unclear
   whether [**1-5**] to colonic obscuration, vs bilateral effusion, in pt with
   known dCHF but no infiltrate/opacity concerning for PNA/aspiration. Has
   cough, unable to clear secretions post extubation, secretions noted to
   be tan, copious, no leukocytosis/fever
   - Collect sputum Cx
   - Continue tent mask, with transition to NC if tolerated.
   - Repeat ABG if worsening picture.
   # CAD - unclear history of CAD
   -CXR/Echo suggests dCHF. Pt does not have sig edema/JVD/and is net

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a chief complaint of bradycardic arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU and has undergone several interventions and tests. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 179/64 mmHg to 194/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving various medications, including famotidine, heparin sodium, dextrose 50%, and hydralazine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation support, indicating acute respiratory failure. It is essential to monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters closely to ensure adequate gas exchange.

2. Seizure with Status Epilepticus: The patient has a history of seizure with status epilepticus. Continuous monitoring of the patient's neurological status and seizure activity is necessary to prevent further episodes.

3. Dementia: The patient has a diagnosis of dementia, which can pose challenges in communication and decision-making. Regular assessments of cognitive function and behavior are required to manage the patient's dementia symptoms appropriately.

4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is within normal limits but there is a documented alteration in nutrition and bradycardia. Close monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and cardiac function is necessary to detect any changes or deterioration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of bradycardic arrest. The patient has a history of alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure (not ARDS), seizure with status epilepticus, dementia (including Alzheimer's and multi-infarct), and bradycardia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, dextrose 50%, hydralazine, and others. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 179/64 mmHg to 194/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, and ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 188, and slightly elevated lactate levels. The patient's blood work reveals normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels, but slightly elevated creatinine and troponin-T levels. The patient's physical examination is significant for cachexia, pupils reactive to light, diminished breath sounds bilaterally without wheezes, soft and non-tender abdomen, thin and wasted extremities, and no edema or rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated at 33 breaths per minute, indicating possible respiratory distress or failure.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently below the normal range (47-85 bpm), which may lead to inadequate cardiac output and decreased perfusion to vital organs.
3. Seizure and status epilepticus: The patient has a history of seizure with status epilepticus, indicating a risk of recurrent seizures.
4. Dementia: The patient's dementia may contribute to poor nutritional intake and increased risk of aspiration pneumonia.
5. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection.
6. Renal insufficiency: The slightly elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction.
7. Cardiac issues: The elevated troponin-T levels suggest possible cardiac injury or ischemia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, cardiac function, and laboratory values to identify and manage any potential complications promptly."

- The patient presented with a bradycardic arrest and is currently in the ICU.
- The patient has a history of seizure, dementia, bradycardia, and a mood disorder.
- Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 179/64 mmHg to 194/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.
- The patient is on various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, dextrose 50%, hydralazine, and others.
- The patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo and magnetic resonance imaging on July 23rd.
- The patient was previously intubated but is now extubated and on a face tent with standby ventilator support.
- The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but slightly elevated creatinine and lactate levels.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, seizure, dementia, bradycardia, and alterations in nutrition.
- The patient's current plan includes monitoring and managing glycemic control, nutrition, and ongoing care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if secretions continue to accumulate and cannot be cleared effectively. Close monitoring and pulmonary toilet"

   Assessment & Plan:  80y/o M with a PMH of CAD, HTN, PVD, COPD admitted
   to neurology service for new onset seizure now transferred to MICU
   following bradycardic arrest.
   .
   # Bradycardia
 Likely post ictal bradycardia, with some contributing
   medication effect from home atenolol.
   HR ranging 70-100 o/n
   EKG shows stable mild  QT prolongation (approx 420)
   Repeat EKG in am.
   - Hold atenolol
   # Seizure
 Etiology of new onset seizures remains unclear. Pt had some
   hypoglycemia in setting of being NPO, suggesting poor glycemic reserves
 hypoglycemia could lead to seizures. Also considerable atrophy on
   head CT/MRi but no acute changes, no evidence tumor. Degenerative
   changes could lead to seizure.
   EEG monitored y/d, read pending from neurology. On depakote, level
   therapeutic or NOT*************************
   Continue q4 neuro checks
    Continue depakote
   f/u EEG read
   -Dementia: Noted in records as mild however MRI suggests considerable
   disease
 Alzheimers vs NPH included in differential. Pt is
   occasionally agitated, but redirectable, oriented to person,
   disoriented to place/time. Neuro to follow.
    Continue zyprexa prn agitation with EKG monitoring for QT prolongation
   -restraints as needed
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - PCO2 70 in the setting of
   bradycardia, low respiratory rate. Post extubation, blood gases/O2 sat
   have remained wnl, O2 dropped slightly, PCO2 increased slightly,  in am
   in setting of receiving sedatives for agitation.
   CXR this am showed blurring of hemidiaphrams bilaterally, unclear
   whether [**1-5**] to colonic obscuration, vs bilateral effusion, in pt with
   known dCHF but no infiltrate/opacity concerning for PNA/aspiration. Has
   cough, unable to clear secretions post extubation, secretions noted to
   be tan, copious, no leukocytosis/fever
   - Collect sputum Cx
   - Continue tent mask, with transition to NC if tolerated.
   - Repeat ABG if worsening picture.
   # CAD - unclear history of CAD
   -CXR/Echo suggests dCHF. Pt does not have sig edema/JVD/and is net
   fluid negative, hypertension does not appear to be related to fluid
   overload.
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - hold meds which may prolong QT
   .
   # COPD - Per report Pt has a history of COPD, had evidence of CO2
   retention during Code blue event however this was most likely secondary
   to decreased respiratory rate in setting of seizure vs bradycardic
   event
   -hypercarbia resolving.
   -Continue to monitor MS, ABG with clinical changes.

 NPO currently, with pending swallow eval. If passes, can begin
   p.o with clears, restart p.o meds, holding atenolol, psych meds with QT
   prolongation. replete K to 4 and Mg to 2

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- The patient was admitted to the neurology service for new onset seizure and later transferred to the MICU following a bradycardic arrest.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, and cultures have been taken to identify the cause of infection.
- The patient has been receiving antibiotics empirically for pneumonia, but the cause of the fever remains unclear.
- The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with episodes of respiratory failure and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has a history of dementia, which is suspected to be Alzheimer's disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been low, indicating hypoglycemia.
- The patient's sodium levels have also been low, indicating hyponatremia.
- The patient's magnesium levels are low, and potassium levels are slightly low.
- The patient's QT interval on the EKG has been prolonged.
- The patient has had a seizure, and an EEG is pending for further evaluation.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows blurring of the heart borders and bilateral hemidiaphrags, which may suggest fluid overload or aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient's blood gases/O2 saturation have remained within normal limits"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the neurology service for new-onset seizure and then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a bradycardic arrest. The patient has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and agitation. He also has a history of dementia and is currently on depakote for seizures. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 144/66 to 174/100 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 70-103 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula with 4.5 L of oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose level, and prolonged QT interval on the EKG. Imaging studies reveal blurring of heart borders, bilateral hemidiaphragms obscured, and evolution of left lower lobe patchy/fluffy area into possible infiltrate with fluids given. Microbiology tests are pending. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, dextrose, famotidine, hydralazine,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted to the neurology service for new onset seizure and later transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a bradycardic arrest.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever of 101.5°F (2122-7-24), which indicates a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure with a PCO2 level of 70. This could be due to hypercarbic respiratory failure or post-extubation complications. Monitoring and appropriate interventions should be done to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Bradycardia: The patient experienced bradycardia during a seizure episode. It is likely post-ictal bradycardia with some contributing medication effect from home atenolol. Continuous monitoring of the heart rate and repeat EKGs should be done.

4. Seizure: The etiology of the new onset seizures remains unclear. Possible causes include hypoglycemia and degenerative changes seen on head CT/MRI. The patient is on depakote, and the level is therapeutic. EEG monitoring should"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the neurology service for new-onset seizures and subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) following a bradycardic arrest.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Fever: The patient has had a fever ranging from 101.5°F to 102.5°F. Blood cultures were obtained, and empirical treatment for pneumonia (PNA) has been initiated.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, as indicated by a PCO2 level of 70 mmHg. This could be due to hypoventilation or a compromised respiratory system. The patient's respiratory rate is low, and he requires supplemental oxygen.

3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently below the normal range (70-100 bpm), indicating bradycardia. This may be attributed to post-ictal bradycardia or the effects of certain medications.

4. Seizure: The patient had a seizure episode, and an EEG is pending for further evaluation. Depakote, a medication for seizure management, has been initiated, and the patient will continue to be monitored for any seizure activity.

The patient is an 80-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, including coronary disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and COPD. He experienced a probable partial seizure with secondary generalization and subsequently had a brief cardiac arrest. The cause of the arrest is unclear, but possible causes include excessive beta blocker effect, cardiac ischemia, or an ictal or postictal arrhythmia. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently recovering in the MICU.

24-hour events:
- The patient developed a fever of 102.5°F and pan cultures were obtained. A chest X-ray was repeated, and sputum culture was collected. Empiric antibiotic treatment was initiated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.
- The patient was agitated, and medication was given to calm him down.
- An EEG was performed, but the results are pending.
- No known drug allergies were reported.
- Various medications were administered, including dextrose, famotidine, hydralazine, and heparin sodium.

Vital Signs:
The patient's maximum temperature recorded was 38.6°C (101.5°F), with a current temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F). His heart rate ranged from 70-103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranged from 86/49-174/100 mmHg, respiratory"

The cause of the arrest is still unclear, but possibilities include excessive beta blocker effect, cardiac ischemia, or ictal or postictal arrhythmia. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently recovering in the MICU.

24-hour events include fever, which prompted the initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected pneumonia. The patient remains afebrile and is being closely monitored for any changes. There have been no overt seizure activities overnight, and the patient is continuing on IV Valproate.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 70-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/49-174/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24-55 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96-97%. The patient's temperature has fluctuated between 37.1°C and 38.6°C.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (12.1 g/dL), slightly low hemoglobin level (36.6 g/dL), and normal platelet count (102,000/mm³). Blood glucose levels have been between 83-183 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and cardiac"

   80 year-old right-handed man with coronary disease,
   hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and COPD, status post
   a probable partial seizure with secondary generalization, now
   status post brief cardiac arrest. He was extubated yesterday
   successfully and is recovering well. The etiology of his arrest
   is not clear; possibilities include excessive beta blocker
   effect, cardiac ischemia (although appears to be ruling out for
   MI), or ictal or postictal arrhythmia. At this point he will
   continue to be observed in the MICU until he is stable from a
   hemodynamic point of view.
   Assessment & Plan:  80y/o M with a PMH of CAD, HTN, PVD, COPD admitted
   to neurology service for new onset seizure now transferred to MICU
   following bradycardic arrest.
   .
   # Bradycardia
 ? remains whether he brady
d down or actually had
   Asystole.
   Pt has been brady down to 40
s on floor but mostly in 70s.
   TFTs wnl, does have degenerative changes on mri could have resulted in
   seizure activity with subsequent post ictal bradychardia in someone who
   at baseline may have some bradychardia.
    CE wnl, Echo shows severe dCHF but no valvular changes, no global wall
   motion abn accounting for brady.
   EKG showed some QT prolongation
   Repeat EKG
   - Hold atenolol
   # Seizure - Per neurology concern given for complex partial seizure
   with secondary generalization and subsequent mild [**Doctor Last Name 6180**] paralysis on
   admission. Pt was not on monitoring so it is unclear if seizure was an
   inciting event code blue.
   Pt has not had any further noted seizure activity,  EEG deferred thus
   far. Noted to be hypoglycemic, no prior hx DM, insulinoma, or oral
   hypoglycemics but hypoglycemia could cause seizures.
   - On anti-epileptic dose depakote in therapeutic range.
   -Check LFTs
   - Head MRI shows atrophy, degeneration ? NPH
 appreciate neuro recs.
   - continue midazolam for sedation as needed.
   -Dementia: Noted in records as mild however MRI suggests considerable
   disease
 Alzheimers vs NPH included in differential. Pt is
   occasionally agitated, but redirectable, oriented to person,
   disoriented to place/time. Communicate with [**Name (NI) **]/son to determine
   baseline MS.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - PCO2 70 in the setting of
   bradycardia, low respiratory rate. Post extubation, blood gases/O2 sat
   have remained wnl, O2 dropped slightly, PCO2 increased slightly,  in am
   in setting of receiving sedatives for agitation.
   CXR this am showed blurring of hemidiaphrams bilaterally, unclear
   whether [**1-5**] to colonic obscuration, vs bilateral effusion, in pt with
   known dCHF but no infiltrate/opacity concerning for PNA/aspiration. Has
   cough, unable to clear secretions post extubation, secretions noted to
   be tan, copious, no leukocytosis/fever
   - Collect sputum Cx
   - Continue tent mask, with transition to NC if tolerated.
   - Repeat ABG if worsening picture.
   # CAD - unclear history of CAD
   -CXR/Echo suggests dCHF. Pt does not have sig edema/JVD/and is net
   fluid negative, hypertension does not appear to be related to fluid
   overload.
   - Repeat ECG in am
   - hold meds which may prolong QT
   .
   # COPD - Per report Pt has a history of COPD, had evidence of CO2
   retention during Code blue event however this was most likely secondary
   to decreased respiratory rate in setting of seizure vs bradycardic
   event
   -hypercarbia resolving.
   -Continue to monitor MS, ABG with clinical changes.
   # FEN
 NPO currently, with pending swallow eval. If passes, can begin
   p.o with clears, restart p.o meds, holding atenolol, psych meds with QT
   prolongation. replete K to 4 and Mg to 2
   Given hypoglycemia, low Sodium, maintenance fluids switched from NS to
   D5, 1/2 NS.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He experienced a probable partial seizure with secondary generalization and had a brief cardiac arrest. The etiology of the arrest is unclear, but possibilities include excessive beta blocker effect, cardiac ischemia, or an ictal or postictal arrhythmia. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently recovering in the medical intensive care unit (MICU). He remains hemodynamically unstable and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has been consistently low, ranging from 40-70 beats per minute. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this is a new development or a pre-existing condition.
2. Seizure: The patient had a seizure with secondary generalization, which may have been an inciting event for the cardiac arrest. An electroencephalogram (EEG) has been deferred thus far.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, as indicated by an elevated PCO2 level. This could be due to decreased respiratory effort or inadequate oxygenation.
4. Pneumonia/Aspiration: Chest X-ray findings suggest potential pneumonia or aspiration. Sputum culture has been collected, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically.
5. Dementia: The patient's cognitive"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU. The patient experienced a tonic-clonic seizure, but a head CT and MRI did not reveal any acute bleed or infarct. The seizure is attributed to the patient's use of Depakote for a mood disorder. The patient also has bradycardia, which is being monitored, and it is suspected to be due to beta-blocker use. The patient has respiratory failure and was previously intubated but is now stable on a nasal cannula. The patient has fever, which is attributed to aspiration pneumonia, and is being treated with empirical antimicrobials. The patient has hypertension, hypoglycemia, and low levels of magnesium, potassium, and phosphate, which need to be addressed. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) due to failed speech and swallow study and is in need of nutritional support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and aspiration pneumonia indicate a risk of infection. If not properly managed, this could lead to sepsis or other complications.
2. Respiratory distress: Although the patient is currently stable on a nasal cannula, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to the previous episode and underlying condition.
3. Neurological complications: The seizure and degenerative changes seen on the MRI suggest potential neurological complications. Further evaluation is required to assess any ongoing neurological damage or future seizure risks.
4. Cardiac events:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient experienced an unwitnessed seizure, resulting in bradycardia, which is attributed to post-ictal effects rather than a primary cardiac event. The bradycardia is currently being monitored, and it is believed to be related to beta-blocker use. The patient has a history of mood disorder and was on Depakote, but developed a tonic-clonic seizure. The head CT was negative for any acute bleed or infarct, but there were significant degenerative changes observed on the MRI. The patient continues to be on Depakote and is awaiting EEG results.

The patient also presented with respiratory failure and was intubated. However, they were successfully extubated and remain stable on a nasal cannula. The patient has significant secretions, requiring suctioning.

A fever has been present, attributed to aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being monitored for further development of symptoms, and empirical antimicrobials have been initiated. The patient's hypertension is being monitored, and adjustments to home medications will be made as necessary.

The patient is also experiencing hypoglycemia while NPO, with blood glucose levels ranging from 50-60. This is being addressed by administering D51/2 NS for maintenance.

Laboratory results indicate low levels of magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and phosphate (PO4), which will be repleted intravenously.
