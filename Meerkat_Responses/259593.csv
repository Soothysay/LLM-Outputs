   Patient started on levophed, vasopressin. When these were maxed,
   started dopamine. Patient became tacchycardic with bigeminy. Switched
   to neo. HR back down to low 100s. Patient was bolused with IV NS (3
   liters) and D5W with 3 amps of bicarb (2 units) until CVPs were at goal
   [**7-12**] and lactate was stable/trending down. Patient oliguric. Patient
   anxious and in pain overnight. Received IV morphine and 1 mg IV ativan.
   Patient is alert and oriented x 3 but now making statements like ""can I
   leave the hospital today."" She feels swollen, diffuse arthralgias,
   warm. Rash is pruritic and bothering her esp when she was febrile. No
   chest or abdominal pain. Patient feels that her work of breathing is
   not worse but she is purse lip breathing.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   46 year-old otherwise healthy female with fever, rash, arthralgias of
   unknown origin now with hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis. Sepsis most likely due to
   PICC contamination - [**12-1**] positive blood cultures (gram positive cocci
   in clusters and pairs) to date (positive drawn from PICC). TTE from
   [**2174-8-25**] shows normal heart function making cardiogenic source less
   likely. No e/o tamponade on most recent echo. Obstructive source such
   as PE possible given recent immobility secondary to illness.
   - PICC removed, culture pending
   -[**Hospital1 **] blood cx
   -consider TEE as TTE neg
   - Continue vancomycin therapy, broadened to included aztreonam and
   levaquin given worsening status
   - Continue to bolus with fluids for goal CVP 8-12 and MAP > 65
   - Continue pressors to acheive bp goals since cvp at goal
   - Mixed venous O2 sats > 70% and crit > 30 so no need for transfusion
   - [**Last Name (un) 567**] stim negative, gave one dose steroids before this came back
   - Follow-up cultures and serologies
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient with oliguric renal failure. FENA is
   0.9. Has made 30 cc over the last 24 hours. UA without casts but
   positive rbcs. Urine eos pending. U/S without evidence of RAS or
   hydronephrosis. Likely ATN [**1-1**] sepsis, hypotension and early DIC.
   Electrolytes stable. Urine eos pending.
   - renal consult in am
   - f/u urine eos
   - bolus IV fluids: NS alternating with D5 with bicarb
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: could be due to sepsis as bandemia is
   increasing as well as early DIC as FDP, d-dimer, PTT, INR rising and
   fibrinogen falling.
   -cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   -consider onc consult
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source. DDx
   includes rheumatologic vs. infectious vs. malignancy. To date, 1 out of
   2 blood cultures positive for GPCs in clusters and pairs. Additional 2
   blood cultures pending. Urine culture, LP negative. Lyme, erlichia,
   rpr, rmsf titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c serologies,
   malaria smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here. Given
   arthralgias, rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given high
   ferritin, currently considering Still's disease on differential. [**Doctor First Name **],
   Rh factor, ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology
   involved. - awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV,
   cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia, added aztreonam and levaquin
   overnight as patient still febrile and hypotensive on 3 pressors
   - d/c doxycycline
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs
   -consider steroids for possible vasculitis although renal failure more
   likely related to sepsis/dic physiology
   - consider onc consult for bm bx
   - Benadryl prn
   .
   # Transaminitis- elevated on admission associated with her initial
   presentation of fever, rash, arthralgias. LFTs stable, trending down
   except for tbili.  RUQ US not technically good, but no evidence of
   cholecystitis or biliary duct dilation. This could be viral or other
   infectious process. Hep serologies neg at osh. Pending here. Consider
   EBV. Could also be c/w stills disease. Should be higher if shock liver.
   -trend lfts
   -f/[**Location 134**] [**Location (Universities) 1396**] u/s

   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus: holding po meds
   - Continue sliding scale insulin at this time, may need to uptitrate as
   sugars are elevated in response to stress
   .
   #. FEN/GI - NPO sips okay, repletes lytes prn, IV fluid bolus prn for
   above goals
   .
   #. Prophylaxis - Pneumatic compression boots, no subq heparin given
   possibility of HIT, bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension. She has been experiencing fever, rash, and arthralgias of unknown origin. The patient is in the ICU and has been started on multiple medications including levophed, vasopressin, and dopamine for her hypotension. She has also been given IV fluids and pain management with morphine and ativan.

The patient has a history of allergies to Ceclor (hives) and is currently on several antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam. Her vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension with a low central venous pressure (CVP) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 76%. She is oliguric with a urine output of 120 mL over the past 24 hours. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and she is on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophilia and a slightly elevated lactate level. Her renal function is impaired with an acute kidney injury (AKI), as indicated by the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Her coagulation profile is abnormal with prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) and elevated D-dimer levels, suggesting disseminated"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   46 year-old otherwise healthy female with fever, rash, arthralgias of
   unknown origin now with hypotension.

   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis. Sepsis most likely due to
   PICC contamination - [**12-1**] positive blood cultures (gram positive cocci
   in clusters and pairs) to date (positive drawn from PICC). TTE from
   [**2174-8-25**] shows normal heart function making cardiogenic source less
   likely. No e/o tamponade on most recent echo. Obstructive source such
   as PE possible given recent immobility secondary to illness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension. She has been experiencing fever, rash, and arthralgias of unknown origin. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to PICC contamination, and acute renal failure. She also has a coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia, which could be due to sepsis or early disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has been receiving multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure, and her condition remains unstable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension - The patient's low blood pressure indicates septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition. Immediate intervention with fluids and vasopressors is necessary to maintain perfusion.
2. Sepsis - The patient's positive blood cultures suggest a bacterial infection, leading to sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated promptly.
3. Acute Renal Failure - The patient's oliguric renal failure requires further evaluation. It could be related to sepsis, hypotension, and early DIC. Renal consultation is recommended, and urine eosinophils are pending.
4. Coagulopathy/Thrombocytopenia - The patient's coagulation profile indicates a possible coagulopathy. This may be due to sepsis or early DIC. Monitoring DIC labs"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis, although source unknown at
   this time.  You has grown out coag negative staph in two different sets
   on different days, making contamination unlikely.  Unlikely, however,
   for coag negative staph to cause severity of DIC that patient currently
   has.
   - Continue meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days (day
   [**1-2**])
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with IVF for goal CVP>8 and MAP>654
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin. Attempt to wean off phenyephrine.
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   - Continue using current left subclavian CVL for now. If patient has
   blood cultures this afternoon that are negative tomorrow afternoon,
   will consider switching out with clean CVL.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient now with oliguric renal failure,
   improved from anuria yesterday.  Likely secondary to DIC causing
   thrombosis formation in addition to hyptoension causing ATN.
   Creatinine continues to rise, this AM to 4.7 from 4.3.  Potassium
   trending up to 4.7 from 4.3.
   - Discuss with renal regarding CVVH
   - Patient will require additional vas cath for CVVH, which will require
   holding APC.  Will also likely require platelets during procedure.
   - Patient with HCO3 of 14, received 2 amps of bicarb and 100 meq in 1L
   IVF overnight.  Follow-up with renal regarding continued bicarb
   replacement.
    .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo yesterday/overnight. Per heme-onc,
   will transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Peripheral rash consistent with DIC, although patient has an apparent
   different rash over upper torso.  DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood cultures positive from [**8-30**]

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old otherwise healthy female with fever, rash, arthralgias of
   unknown origin now with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis. Sepsis most likely due to
   PICC contamination - [**12-1**] positive blood cultures (gram positive cocci
   in clusters and pairs) to date (positive drawn from PICC). TTE from
   [**2174-8-25**] shows normal heart function making cardiogenic source - less
   likely. No e/o tamponade on most recent echo.
   - Continue meropenem
   - Vancomycin trough this AM XXXX.  As patient with rapidly changing
   renal function, will continue to monitor levels and dose accordingly.
   - Given concern of Still's, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days started
   ([**1-2**]).
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures.  PICC tip prelim no growth.
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with fluids for goal CVP 8-12 and MAP > 65
   - Continue pressors to acheive bp goals since cvp at goal. Wean
   phenylephrine if possible.
   - Mixed venous O2 sats > 70% and crit > 30 so no need for transfusion
   - Follow-up cultures and serologies
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient with oliguric renal failure. FENA is
   0.9. UOP has increased to 240cc/24 hours. UA without casts but positive
   rbcs. Negative urine eosinophils. U/S without evidence of RAS or
   hydronephrosis. Likely ATN [**1-1**] sepsis, hypotension and early DIC.
   Electrolytes stable.
   - Appreciate renal recs. Will follow-up regarding potential for CVVH.
   - Bolus IVF
   .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: could be due to sepsis as bandemia is
   increasing as well as early DIC as FDP, d-dimer, PTT, INR rising and
   fibrinogen falling.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source. DDx
   includes rheumatologic vs. infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood
   cultures positive from [**8-30**] with coag negative Staph, [**8-31**] culture
   positive for GPC in pairs and clusters.  Urine culture, LP negative.
   Lyme, erlichia, rpr, rmsf titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and
   c serologies, malaria smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here.
   Given arthralgias, rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given
   high ferritin, currently considering Still's disease on differential.
   [**Doctor First Name **], Rh factor, ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology
   involved. - awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV,
   cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia added meropenem as
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline
   - Continue xigress and solumedrol
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs. Will resend C3, C4 in 48 hours.
   - Per onc, will check CT for lymphadenopathy when patient more stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female who presented with fever, rash, and arthralgias. She is now experiencing sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has been on invasive ventilation since September 2nd. Her condition has rapidly deteriorated, with worsening metabolic acidosis, anuria, and respiratory distress. Bilateral fluffy infiltrates were seen on chest X-ray. The patient is confused and required soft restraints after receiving ativan. She has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs. The source of sepsis is suspected to be contamination of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels and oliguric renal failure. Her coagulation profile shows elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), indicating a coagulopathy that could be due to sepsis or early DIC. The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 60,000/mm3. Extensive workup has been done, including blood cultures, urinalysis, and serologies, but no clear source of infection has been identified. Rheumatologic disease, such as Still's disease, is also considered on the differential diagnosis. The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently receiving multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure. She is also on Xigris (drotrecogin alfa), Solumedrol (methylprednisolone), and various antibiotics. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to be in the ICU for further management. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Progressive respiratory failure due to worsening of bilateral fluffy infiltrates and inadequate oxygenation.
2. Acute renal failure may progress further, leading to anuria and electrolyte imbalances.
3. The coagulopathy could worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia may continue to worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding.
5. Infection control measures should be continued to prevent further bacterial infections.
6. There is a possibility of developing more organ dysfunctions, such as hepatic dysfunction.
7. The patient's condition may deteriorate further, leading to cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   .
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis, although source unknown at
   this time.  You has grown out coag negative staph in two different sets
   on different days, making contamination unlikely.  Unlikely, however,
   for coag negative staph to cause severity of DIC that patient currently
   has.
   - Continue meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days (day
   [**1-2**])
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with IVF for goal CVP>8 and MAP>654
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin. Attempt to wean off phenyephrine.
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   - Continue using current left subclavian CVL for now. If patient has
   blood cultures this afternoon that are negative tomorrow afternoon,
   will consider switching out with clean CVL.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient now with oliguric renal failure,
   improved from anuria yesterday.  Likely secondary to DIC causing
   thrombosis formation in addition to hyptoension causing ATN.
   Creatinine continues to rise, this AM to 4.7 from 4.3.  Potassium
   trending up to 4.7 from 4.3.
   - Discuss with renal regarding CVVH
   - Patient will require additional vas cath for CVVH, which will require
   holding APC.  Will also likely require platelets during procedure.
   - Patient with HCO3 of 14, received 2 amps of bicarb and 100 meq in 1L
   IVF overnight.  Follow-up with renal regarding continued bicarb
   replacement.
    .
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo yesterday/overnight. Per heme-onc,
   will transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   .
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Peripheral rash consistent with DIC, although patient has an apparent
   different rash over upper torso.  DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood cultures positive from [**8-30**]
   with coag negative Staph, [**8-31**] culture positive for GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  Urine culture, LP negative. Lyme, erlichia, rpr, rmsf
   titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c serologies, malaria
   smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here. Given arthralgias,
   rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given high ferritin,
   currently considering Still's disease on differential. [**Doctor First Name **], Rh factor,
   ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology involved. -
   awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV, cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia. Added meropenem yesterday.
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline
   - Continue xigress and solumedrol
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs. Will resend C3, C4 in 48 hours.
   - Per onc, will check CT for lymphadenopathy when patient more stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition has been worsening over the past day, with several complications and ongoing medical concerns.

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely secondary to sepsis. Despite receiving multiple pressors, the patient's blood pressure remains low. Cultures have grown coag-negative staph, but the source of infection is still unknown. The plan includes continuing meropenem and vancomycin, as well as surveillance cultures.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed oliguric renal failure, likely due to DIC causing thrombosis formation and hypotension leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Creatinine levels continue to rise, and potassium is trending up. Renal consultation is recommended, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) may be necessary.

3. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: The patient's coagulopathy is most likely secondary to DIC. Fibrinogen levels are low, and cryoprecipitate transfusion is planned. Monitoring of DIC labs every six hours is recommended.

4. Fever/rash/arthralgias: The patient has a fever, rash, and arthralgias, with an extensive workup revealing no clear source. Cultures"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias, sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has been experiencing hypotension, acute renal failure, coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, fever/rash/arthralgias, and transaminitis. The source of infection is still unknown. The patient has received multiple antibiotics and blood products. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a central venous catheter. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Due to sepsis and organ dysfunction, the patient may develop MODS, where multiple organs fail.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension can lead to further hemodynamic instability, potentially causing shock.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to anuria or oliguria.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may continue to worsen, resulting in bleeding complications.
7. Metabolic Disturbances: The patient may experience"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 year-old female with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin now
   with sepsis, respiratory failure, and DIC.
   #. Hypotension - Likely secondary to sepsis, although source unknown at
   this time.  You has grown out coag negative staph in two different sets
   on different days, making contamination unlikely.  Unlikely, however,
   for coag negative staph to cause severity of DIC that patient currently
   has.
   - Continue meropenem, dose vanco based on serum level this AM
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - f/u blood and PICC tip cultures
   - Given possibility of Still
s, solumedrol 1 gram Q24H x3 days (day
   [**1-2**])
   - TEE recommended per ID
   - Continue to bolus with IVF for goal CVP>8 and MAP>654
   - Continue levophed and vasopressin. Attempt to wean off phenyephrine.
   - F/u cultures and serologies.
   - Continue using current left subclavian CVL for now. If patient has
   blood cultures this afternoon that are negative tomorrow afternoon,
   will consider switching out with clean CVL.
   #. Acute renal failure - Patient now with oliguric renal failure,
   improved from anuria yesterday.  Likely secondary to DIC causing
   thrombosis formation in addition to hyptoension causing ATN.
   Creatinine continues to rise, this AM to 4.7 from 4.3.  Potassium
   trending up to 4.7 from 4.3.
   - Discuss with renal regarding CVVH
   - Patient will require additional vas cath for CVVH, which will require
   holding APC.  Will also likely require platelets during procedure.
   - Patient with HCO3 of 14, received 2 amps of bicarb and 100 meq in 1L
   IVF overnight.  Follow-up with renal regarding continued bicarb
   replacement.
   #. Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: Most likely secondary to DIC.
   Patient has received 4 units of cryo yesterday/overnight. Per heme-onc,
   will transfuse cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <250.
   - Cont to monitor q6 DIC labs
   - Continue to replete fibrinogen with cryo per onc recs.
   - Follow-up with hematology-oncology
   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Peripheral rash consistent with DIC, although patient has an apparent
   different rash over upper torso.  DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy. Currently, blood cultures positive from [**8-30**]
   with coag negative Staph, [**8-31**] culture positive for GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  Urine culture, LP negative. Lyme, erlichia, rpr, rmsf
   titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c serologies, malaria
   smear negative.  Infectious w/u pending here. Given arthralgias,
   rheumatologic disease also a possibility - given high ferritin,
   currently considering Still's disease on differential. [**Doctor First Name **], Rh factor,
   ccp, parvovirus, HLA b27 negative. ID, rheumatology involved. -
   awaiting additional labs - infectious hepatitis, HIV, cryoglobulins.
   - appreciate derm involvment, awaiting bx results
   - Continue vancomycin for bacteremia. Added meropenem yesterday.
   - Per ID, continue doxycycline
   - Continue xigress and solumedrol
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN temp - limit dose secondary to mild
   transaminitis
   - Continue to monitor blood cultures, picc, urine cx
   - Follow-up ID recs: sent for cryptococcus ag, hisotplasma ag,
   coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   - Follow-up rheumatology recs. Will resend C3, C4 in 48 hours.
   - Per onc, will check CT for lymphadenopathy when patient more stable.
   # Transaminitis- elevated on admission associated with her initial
   presentation of fever, rash, arthralgias. LFTs stable, trending down
   except for tbili.  RUQ US not technically good, but no evidence of
   cholecystitis or biliary duct dilation. This could be viral or other
   infectious process. Hep serologies neg at osh. Pending here. Consider
   EBV. Could also be c/w stills disease. Should be higher if shock liver.
   -trend lfts
   -f/[**Location 134**] [**Location (Universities) 1396**] u/s
   -f/u hep and other infectious serologies
   #. Diabetes mellitus: holding po meds
   - Continue sliding scale insulin at this time, may need to uptitrate as
   sugars are elevated in response to stress
   #. FEN/GI - NPO, repletes lytes prn, IV fluid bolus prn for above goals
   #. Prophylaxis - Pneumatic compression boots, no subq heparin given
   possibility of HIT, bowel regimen
   #. Code status - Full code confirmed
   #. Access - PIV, left subclavia, left radial arterial line, FC.
   #. Communication: with husband and sister, numbers in chart and pt's

   Addendum:
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1119**] spoke with the patient
s sister, who is the HCP this
   morning, and was informed that the family is moving towards CMO.  We
   continue current therapies while a final decision is made and family
   members are assembled.  However, we will hold off on additional lab
   test, imaging, and procedures in the mean time.
","The patient is a 46-year-old female presenting with fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin, now with sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has been on three pressors (levophed, neo, and vasopressin) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and if hypotensive, epinephrine may be considered.

The patient has acute renal failure with anuria, worsening creatinine, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities. CVVH has been initiated and tolerated, and femoral dialysis catheter placement is planned. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia likely secondary to DIC. Fibrinogen levels are being monitored and cryoprecipitate has been given. Hematology-oncology has performed a bone marrow biopsy to rule out hemophagocytic lymphangiohistiocytosis (HLH).

Fever and rash are still present, with extensive workup showing no clear source. Purpuric rash is consistent with DIC, and differential diagnosis includes rheumatologic diseases, infectious diseases, and malignancies such as Still's disease or HLH. Blood cultures are pending, as well as serologies for Lyme disease, malaria, cryptococcus, histoplasma, coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides, and other infectious agents.

The patient has elevated liver"

   24 Hour Events:
   CT-head official read:
   Persistent effacement of sulci with poor [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white matter
   differentiation, likely due to mild cerebral edema. The temporal horns
   of the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle have slightly
   decreased size, concerning for subtle increase in intracranial
   pressure. Clinical correlation and close follow-up are recommended. MRI
   would also be helpful for further evaluation.
   -Pt continues to be on 3 pressors with labile pressures --> MAP went
   into the 50's and 60's.  Pt given IVF 1.5L, maxed out on levophed &
   vasopressin.  Considering starting epi drip if patient is maxed out on
   neo.
   Renal: HD cath placed in R femoral --> patient started on CVVH. If
   patient tolerates will call blood bank to start plasma exhange.
   ID: unable to account for septic presentation based on coag neg staph,

   #. Fever/rash/arthralgias - Extensive workup with no clear source.
   Purpuric rash consistent with DIC. DDx includes rheumatologic vs.
   infectious vs. malignancy (catastrophic APLA syndrome vs. Still
   disease vs. hemophagocytic lymphangiohistiocytosis). Currently, blood
   cultures positive from [**8-30**], [**8-31**] with coag negative Staph resistent to
   oxacillin.  All other blood cultures negative Urine culture, Lyme,
   erlichia, rpr, rmsf titers, monospot, herpes, cmv, hiv, hep b and c
   serologies, malaria smear negative.  Sent for cryptococcus ag,
   hisotplasma ag, coxiella, brucella, leptospirosis, strongyloides ag.
   infectious w/u pending here. Given arthralgias, rheumatologic disease
   also a possibility - given high ferritin, currently considering Still's
   disease on differential. ID, rheumatology, hem/onc involved. awaiting
   additional labs . Skin biopsy results nonspecific (thrombosed vessels).
   Sternal bone marrow biopsy by hem/onc for HLH.
   - will discuss initiaition of plasma exchange since pt BP are

   # [**Name (NI) 1508**] Pt with severely elevated LFT consistent with shocked
   liver.  Elevated on admission associated with her initial presentation
   of fever, rash, arthralgias. LFTs stable, trending down except for
   tbili.  RUQ US not technically good, but no evidence of cholecystitis
   or biliary duct dilation. This could be viral or other infectious
   process. Hep serologies neg. Consider EBV --> VL pending. Could also be
   c/w stills disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a complex medical history, including fever, rash, arthralgias of unknown origin, sepsis, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She is currently in the ICU and requires multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure. She has acute renal failure, anemia, coagulopathy, and elevated liver enzymes. Her condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock/Hypotension: The patient continues to be dependent on three pressors (levophed, neo, and vasopressin) to maintain blood pressure. This indicates ongoing hypotension, which can lead to organ perfusion deficits and further complications.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has respiratory failure and evidence of ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, and the need for mechanical ventilation. ARDS can progress to respiratory failure and require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has signs of DIC, including thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer levels, and fibrin degradation products. DIC can lead to bleeding complications and organ dysfunction.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has anur"
