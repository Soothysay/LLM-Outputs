","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), and prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She presents to the ICU with hypotension from home hemodialysis (HD). The patient has an ineffective coping mechanism and impaired skin integrity. She has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and type I diabetes mellitus (DM). There are concerns about a possible line infection, pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and septic shock.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension is a concern for line infection. Surveillance cultures will be repeated, and empiric antibiotics will be continued. The possibility of volume overload is also considered.
2. ESRD/Volume Overload: The patient's renal planning for HD today is uncertain due to her hypotension and pressor requirement. Total body volume overload is noted.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can be a result of poor vascular access or prolonged bed rest.
4. Ineffective Coping Mechanism: The patient is experiencing difficulty participating in her care plan, but this can be negotiated at the moment. Psychiatry involvement may be recommended if the patient continues to refuse care.
5. Anemia: The patient may have anemia of chronic disease due to ESRD, but bloody stools are also reported. Guaiac stools"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) who presents from hemodialysis (HD) with hypotension. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications.

The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension with a blood pressure of 91/54 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 bpm, and a slightly elevated respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 99% with the use of a nasal cannula.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, suggesting no ongoing myocardial infarction. Renal function is compromised as indicated by the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient also has anemia, likely due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), but further investigation is needed to rule out acute blood loss.

The patient has a history of multiple line infections, including MRSA, and there is concern for another line infection given the rising white blood cell count, ongoing pressor requirement, and tachycardia. Cultures have not yet shown growth, but surveillance cultures will be repeated. The patient also has evidence of volume overload, as seen on the chest X-ray, which may contribute to her hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with type I diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the MICU with hypotension and is presumed to have sepsis, possibly due to a line infection or pneumonia. Blood cultures were negative. The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. She is not clinically in shock and is being monitored for weaning off vasopressors. She is volume overloaded, as per physical examination and chest X-ray, so no additional fluids will be given. The plan includes ongoing HD and further management as per the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension and presumed sepsis indicates a serious infection. It is crucial to identify and treat the source of infection promptly to prevent further complications.
2. Line infection: Given the negative blood cultures, a line infection should be considered as a potential source of sepsis. Regular monitoring of the patient's lines and appropriate measures to prevent and manage line-related infections are necessary.
3. Pneumonia: Another possible source of sepsis could be pneumonia. Clinical assessment, including respiratory symptoms and imaging studies, should be performed to rule out or confirm this condition.
4. Volume overload: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, as indicated by"

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She presents from a healthcare facility with hypotension and is currently in the ICU.

Overnight, the patient's blood pressure remained low, ranging from 70-72 mmHg, and levophed was restarted at a low dose. Lactate levels were elevated. The patient initially refused a finger stick but later agreed to it. A transthoracic echo did not show any significant changes compared to the previous study. Dialysis was deferred until the patient's blood pressure stabilizes. A sacral wound culture was obtained.

The patient has allergies to clindamycin, Zemplar (paricalcitol), levofloxacin, trazodone, doxycycline, haldol (haloperidol lactate), and an unknown medication. The last doses of antibiotics, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), were administered on 11/22/2145 at 9:00 AM and 11/24/2145 at 6:30 AM, respectively.

   # Hypotension: Ongoing pressor requirement, weaning levophed as
   tolerated.  Pneumonia vs. occult infection vs. intraabdominal process.
   Abdominal pain appears to be a chronic issue.  would consider CT A/P in
   future if pain worsens.
   -Will wean pressors and assess need for BP support by mental status.
   - continue empiric vanco/zosyn for now for pneumonia
   - TTE: unchanged
   - C. Diff negative
   - Wound culture pending
   - trend lactate today

   #Volume/ESRD: Renal planning for HD today.  Unclear if she will be able
   to tolerate HD and may need CVVH given hypotension and pressor
   requirement.
   -Total body volume overloaded.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery. She presents from a healthcare facility with hypotension and has multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease, anemia, and ineffective coping. The patient's abdominal pain appears to be chronic, and there are concerns about possible infections such as pneumonia or intraabdominal processes. The patient's blood glucose levels have been erratic, and she requires ongoing pressor support. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet. The patient's mental status is being monitored for any changes related to her blood pressure. The patient's wound culture is pending, and she is receiving empiric antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. Renal planning for hemodialysis is underway, but it is unclear if the patient will tolerate it due to hypotension and pressor requirement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires ongoing pressor support, indicating a potential cardiovascular complication. The cause of the hypotension needs further investigation, and the patient may require further intervention to stabilize her blood pressure.
2. Infection: There are concerns about possible infections, including pneumonia or intraabdominal processes. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, and the wound culture is pending. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent the progression of these infections.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with Type I diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension during hemodialysis. She has been on various antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and is currently being treated with norepinephrine for persistent hypotension. Her vital signs are stable, but she has an increased lactate level indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. She has a history of allergies to clindamycin, levofloxacin, and haldol. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except as noted above. The patient is on a peritoneal dialysis regimen and has been receiving regular insulin for glycemic control. She has multiple lines and a dialysis catheter in place. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and troponin T levels. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, and purposeful movements with intact orientation. The patient's condition remains critically ill, and further plans will be made based on the resident's note.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypotension. The note mentions several events that occurred over the past 24 hours, including blood cultures taken from new arterial and hemodialysis lines, CT torso showing a possible splenic laceration, and extensive peripheral vascular disease. The patient has multiple allergies, including clindamycin, Zemplar (paricalcitol), levofloxacin, trazodone, doxycycline, haldol (haloperidol), and an unknown medication. 

The patient is currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine and lorazepam. They are also on other ICU medications and have ongoing medical and family history. The review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of hypotension.

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate between 99-111 bpm, blood pressure at 77/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The fluid balance indicates a negative balance of 1,900 mL, with total input of 1,100 mL and total output of 3,000 mL. 

The respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula, with SpO2 at 100%. The ABG results show pH at 7.26, PCO2 at 34 mmHg, PO2 at 87 mmHg, and HCO3- at 18 mEq/L. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, with no acute distress. PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic, and bilateral crackles at the bases of the lungs. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present and mild distension. The extremities show trace edema bilaterally. The skin is not assessed, and the neurologic examination is incomplete.

The lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/troponin-T, ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase/TBili, lactic acid, albumin, LDH, calcium/magnesium/phosphate are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal. The imaging studies show evidence of a possible splenic laceration, cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, increased massive ascites, and a soft tissue mass in the right pelvis likely representing a right ovarian remnant.

The patient's assessment and plan include ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, renal failure (end-stage renal disease), diabetes mellitus type 1, and hypotension (not in shock). The potential medical complications that can arise include infection due to the presence of an indwelling catheter, further bleeding from a possible splenic laceration, worsening renal function, and complications related to diabetes mellitus."

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged female with a chief complaint of hypotension. She has a history of ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, renal failure (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type I, and hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on multiple medications including norepinephrine, lorazepam, and various antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 77/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient has crackles at the bases of her lungs bilaterally, soft non-tender abdomen with distention, trace edema in both lower extremities, and no skin abnormalities noted. Her labs show elevated creatinine, BUN, glucose levels, and slightly low hemoglobin. The patient's imaging reveals findings consistent with a splenic laceration, cardiomegaly with pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, increased ascites, and a possible ovarian remnant in the pelvis. The patient's medical team is considering further evaluation and treatment options based on these findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Splenic laceration: This could potentially lead to ongoing internal bleeding and worsening hypotension if not addressed promptly.
2. Cardiomegaly with pleural effusions and atelectasis: These"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presents with persistent hypotension. She has a history of massive ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, and a splenic laceration. The patient is currently tolerating no pressors and the source of hypotension is unclear. Possible causes include cardiogenic shock from decompensated heart failure, sepsis, or less likely pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's chest CT will be reviewed with radiology to look for PE. Pan-cultures are negative and follow-up chest CT read will be done if no obvious infection is found, after which antibiotics will be discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock from decompensated heart failure: This can lead to poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pan-cultures are negative, indicating no current bloodstream infection. However, sepsis cannot be completely ruled out as a cause of hypotension.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient is not hypoxemic, PE is a possibility that should be considered. A chest CT will be reviewed to look for evidence of PE.
4. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,900 mL, indicating fluid loss. This could contribute to hypotension"

   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology.  Confirmed by A-line yesterday.  CT
   with finding of possible splenic laceration with unclear clinical
   significance.  Consider further imaging PRN.  Cardiac unlikely given
   echo findings, ECG and CE
s, infectious is more likely but no culture
   growth, must also consider PE, RV infarct, decompensated heart failure
   given recent echo findings of dilated RV.
   - Discuss CT Torso with radiology regarding question of PE, Check
   LENI
   - wean pressors as tolerated and go by mental status with MAP > 55,
   trend lactate
   - d/c antibiotics today
   - TTE: with dilated RV
   - C. Diff negative
   - Wound culture pending
   - trend lactate today

   # Diarrhea: resolved, follow stools.  Given nursing home resident
   taking abx as outpatient would rule out C. Diff infection.
   - c. diff studies negative x1
   - guaiac stools.

   # CAD: Continue outpatient medications except BP meds
   - hold lisinopril, atenolol
 restart when able

   # Diabetes: Last A1c was 7.4, will add low dose insulin today.
   - Continue insulin regimen.
   - Clarify home doses.

   # Anemia: Likely Anemia of chronic disease due to ESRD, but given
   report of bloody stools, and patient mildly off baseline would guaiac
   stools.  Ferritin 490 in [**Month (only) **] so not likely to be iron deficient
   unless having acute blood loss in stools.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) who presented to the hospital with hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology. It was confirmed by an arterial line yesterday, and a CT scan showed a possible splenic laceration with unclear clinical significance. The cardiac cause is unlikely given the echo findings, ECG, and cardiac enzymes. An infectious cause is more likely but no culture growth has been observed. Other possible causes to consider are pulmonary embolism (PE), right ventricular (RV) infarct, or decompensated heart failure.

2. Volume/ESRD: The patient has total body volume overload but improved after net fluid removal. Renal dialysis was performed yesterday.

3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea has resolved. Given her nursing home residency and antibiotic use, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection is a possibility, but studies have been negative. Guaiac stools should be followed to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. CAD: The patient's coronary artery disease requires continuation of outpatient medications except for blood pressure medications. Lisinopril and atenolol should be held temporarily and restarted when appropriate.

5. Diabetes: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI) who presents from home with hypotension. She has multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and mental health issues. The patient's condition is unstable, and she requires intensive care unit (ICU) care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient presents with hypotension of unclear etiology. Possible causes include sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary embolism (PE), right ventricular infarction (RVI), or decompensated heart failure. Further imaging and diagnostic tests are needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Possible Splenic Laceration: A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a possible splenic laceration, which may be related to the hypotension. The clinical significance of this finding needs to be assessed, and additional imaging may be necessary.

3. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's recent echocardiogram showed dilated right ventricle (RV), suggesting possible cardiac dysfunction. This could be due to RVI or decompensated heart failure. Further evaluation is required to confirm the diagnosis.

4. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient's wound culture is pending. She also had a history of MRSA line infections in the past. Therefore, infection remains a concern and"

The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is of unclear etiology. A arterial line confirmed the hypotension, and a CT scan showed a possible splenic laceration with unclear clinical significance. The cardiac cause is unlikely given echo findings, ECG, and cardiac enzymes. An infectious cause is more likely but no culture growth. Other potential causes include pulmonary embolism (PE), right ventricular (RV) infarct, or decompensated heart failure. Further imaging, such as a CT torso, should be considered to rule out PE. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) should be monitored, and the decision to wean pressors should be based on mental status with mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 55.

   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology.  Cardiogenic shock is possible given
   improvement with afterload reduction and echo findings. Septic shock is
   less likely as there has been no culture growth. Unlikely to be PE
   given negative LENIs and no e/o this on imaging. CT with finding of
   possible splenic laceration with unclear clinical significance but
   stable HCTs no e/o bleed.  In any case hypotension is reoslving at this
   point.

   # Diabetes: Last A1c was 7.4
   - Continue insulin regimen.
   - Clarify home doses.

   # Anemia: Likely Anemia of chronic disease due to ESRD. Ferritin 490 in
   [**Month (only) **] so not likely to be iron deficient unless having acute blood
   loss in stools.
   - Hct with slow downward drift likely related to phlebotomy and
   dilution

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI) who presented to the hospital with hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with possible cardiogenic shock due to improvement with afterload reduction and echocardiogram (echo) findings. Sepsis is less likely as there has been no culture growth. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also unlikely given negative lower extremity Doppler ultrasound (LENS) and no evidence on imaging. The patient has a history of MRSA line infections and presents from home with hypotension.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Other lab results indicate elevated creatinine (Cr), glucose levels, troponin-T, lactate acid, and lactic acid, while calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) levels are within normal range.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure (BP) ranging from 95/55 mmHg to 114/63 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) is between 88-107 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 95% on nasal cannula.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who has been admitted to the ICU. She presented with persistent hypotension and an unknown source of hypotension. The possible causes include cardiogenic shock from decompensated heart failure, sepsis, and less likely pulmonary embolism (PE) as she is not hypoxemic. Pan-cultures have been negative, indicating no signs of infection.

The patient also has a clot at the end of her HD line and a splenic infarct, for which she has been started on heparin. She has a history of retinal hemorrhage, and there is a concern about the risks of ocular hemorrhage with the use of aspirin (ASA), Plavix, and heparin. The plan is to consult an ophthalmologist to weigh in on these risks and consider stopping anticoagulation if the risks are too high.

The patient's volume status needs to be addressed, and she will be placed on fluid restriction. Her diabetes mellitus (DM) requires management, including the initiation of basal long-acting insulin in addition to regular insulin sliding scale.

Regarding access, a new intravenous (IV) line is needed, and a guided percutaneous internal jugular central catheter (PICC) will be placed. The femoral line will be discontinued.

The patient is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. She is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker. There are no ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) concerns at this time.

Code status is full code, and the patient will be transferred to the floor once her condition improves."
