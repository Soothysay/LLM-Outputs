","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of OCD, previous overdose, anorexia, alcohol use, and ileostomy, currently in fulminant liver failure. She has multiple medical complications including hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, acid-base imbalance, hypoxia, psych issues, headache, hypercholesterolemia, and poor access. The assessment suggests possible Tylenol ingestion as the cause of liver failure, but other causes like medication reactions or vascular problems are also considered. The plan includes monitoring liver function, conducting further investigations, and considering liver transplantation. Renal failure is likely secondary to liver failure, and other complications such as DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP should be managed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to severe liver dysfunction, the patient may develop altered mental status and confusion.
2. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to liver failure increases the risk of infections, including pneumonia and sepsis.
3. Hepato-renal syndrome: Prolonged liver dysfunction can lead to kidney damage, resulting in acute kidney injury or failure.
4. Coagulopathy: Liver failure can disrupt normal blood clotting mechanisms, leading to an increased risk of bleeding.
5. Hepatic hydrothorax: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space can occur due to liver dysfunction.
6. Hepatomeg"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of OCD, stable recently but with past history of OD, anorexia, and alcohol use. She presents with ileostomy and is in fulminant liver failure. The cause of liver failure is unclear and differential diagnoses include medication toxicity (simvastatin, bactrim), Tylenol ingestion, autoimmune hepatitis, vascular issues, and infectious causes. Most likely toxin is Tylenol, although it may be possible that Tylenol ingestion occurred after liver failure started.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 103/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and face tent.

On physical examination, the patient is lightly jaundiced and feels generally unwell. She has scleral icterus, clear oropharynx, equal and round pupils, no jugular venous distention, no thyroid enlargement, no liver auscultation findings, and tender abdomen with ileostomy in the right upper quadrant. She has asterixis, upgoing toes bilaterally, and normal strength.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), low albumin, elevated lactate levels, and other abnormal values. Imaging studies are pending.

The plan includes monitoring mental status, conducting full abdominal ultrasound"

   # Liver Failure:  Most likely etiology Tylenol overdose given elevated
   level at OSH, persistent elevated level here. Started on Mucomyst (PO
   at OSH, IV here). [**Month (only) 8**] also have had other precipitating factors
   including other medication effects (simvastatin, bactrim), vascular,
   infectious.  Given fulminant nature of hepatic failure will need
   evaluation for possible transplant.
   - Liver and transplant following
   - F/u labs, viral studies, AI w/u
   - mucomyst IV protocol
   - monitor finger sticks
   - Tylenol level Q hour until peak determined. Peak determined so will
   increase interval of checks. Should continue to trend down
   - Will need to lighten sedation to enable serial neuro exams to assess
   mental status for encephalopathy as well as cerebral edema given
   increased risk of edema with acute hepatic failure
   - Trend coags
   - Will start Vanc/Zosyn per hepatology recs, low threshold for
   antibiotic given increased risk of infection

   Lighten sedation to enable serial neuron exams
   - EKG, CXR, Echo
   - Antibody screen, etc

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of OCD, ileostomy, and alcohol use admitted to the ICU with acute fulminant hepatic failure and acute renal failure. She received four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for INR reversal and was given Lasix to treat pulmonary edema. However, she continued to desaturate, leading to intubation for airway protection and hypoxemic respiratory failure. A nasogastric tube was also placed, and a right internal jugular (RIJ) catheter was inserted under ultrasound guidance.

The patient has a background of Tylenol overdose, anorexia, and alcohol use. Her liver function tests are significantly elevated, indicating liver damage. She has a history of medication effects, vascular issues, and infections as potential precipitating factors for her condition. An evaluation for possible liver transplant is needed due to the fulminant nature of her hepatic failure.

She is currently on Mucomyst IV protocol, and her Tylenol level will be monitored every hour until the peak is determined. The patient's mental status is difficult to assess due to sedation, so efforts will be made to lighten sedation for serial neuro exams. Trending coagulation studies is important, and antibiotics have been started due to an increased risk of infection.

The patient's renal function is impaired, likely secondary to liver failure. Hepatorenal syndrome is less likely given her high"

   yet to be identified but certainly toxic and ischemic insult are most
   likely with brisk evolution of significant hepatitis--new medications
   are only Bactrim and statin.  Acute infectious hepatitis is possible
   and will need to be more completely evaluated.  With severe and
   fulminant hepatic failure both investigations of source and rapid
   evaluation for treatment and consideration of transplant will be
   needed.
   Hepatic Failure- concern for tylenol ingestion, on NAC, -Viral studies

","The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted with fulminant hepatic failure. The cause of the hepatic failure is yet to be identified, but toxic and ischemic insults are the most likely causes. The patient has shown a rapid evolution of significant hepatitis, and new medications include Bactrim and a statin. Acute infectious hepatitis is also possible and needs further evaluation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 114/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on invasive ventilation support.

Physical examination reveals crackles in the respiratory/chest area and scattered petechiae on the skin. Neurologically, the patient is sedated and not assessed for movement or tone.

Lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin levels, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal renal function tests (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen).

Imaging shows a chest X-ray, but no significant findings are mentioned.

The patient's assessment and plan include concerns for possible Tylenol ingestion, treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and evaluation for viral studies (including HIV). An abdominal ultrasound shows patent portal veins, and pre-transplant evaluation is needed (including chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram). The"

   Total time spent: 80 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old female admitted with fulminant hepatic failure, likely due to Tylenol overdose. She is currently on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for potential acetaminophen toxicity. There is also ongoing workup for viral and medication-related causes.

The patient is critically ill and has several medical complications:

1. Hepatic Failure: The patient has evidence of severe liver dysfunction, indicated by elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin levels, and coagulopathy (INR >4).

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, likely secondary to hepatic failure and possible Tylenol toxicity. She is receiving volume challenges and being closely monitored. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) may be considered if needed.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR indicates significant bleeding risk. A head CT has been ordered due to the presence of a significant headache, which raises concern for cerebral edema or bleeding.

4. HypoNa: The patient's sodium levels are low. NAC is being given in dextrose 5% in water (D5W), which can contribute to hyperglycemia. The plan is to start 3% normal saline (NS) and closely monitor sodium levels.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, central venous access, deep vein thrombosis (D"

   Assessment and Plan
   Fulminant hepatic failure complicated by respiratory failure, renal
   failure, fevers.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, multifactorial.  Suspect component
   of ARDS, volume overload (CHF), pneumonia, encephalopathy.  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, maintain SaO2 >90%
   HEPATIC FAILURE -- resolving, tranplantation not indicated.  Attributed
   to Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim reaction, possible acetominophen, and
   possible contribution of EtOH.  Continue to monitor.  Hepatology
   service to f/u.
   RENAL FAILURE -- complication of acute fulminant hepatic failure,
   probable ATN (hypovolemia, vasopressors).  Requiring dialysis.  Recent
   creatinine rise on dialysis somewhat concerning.
   FEVERS -- uncertain etiology, but concerns for active infection (5%
   bandemia recently)  include VAP (bilateral lower lobe consolidation by
   CT scan), line-related infection, hepatobiliary infection (ex.
   acalculous choleystitis), CNS infection (ICP site).  Repeat RUQ US.
   Bronchoscopy with protected brush.  Hold empirical antimicrobials
   unless hemodynamic instability.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF @ goal.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded in context of resussication.  Plan to
   net diurese (lasix and dialysis).
   CNS hematoma -- right frontal, bolt site.  Plan for re-imaging to
   assess progress or regression.  Plan head CT w/o contrast.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with acute hepatic failure, initially admitted to the MICU service, intubated, and then transferred to the Transplant Surgical service for evaluation of possible need for liver transplant. The patient has improved liver function since transfer to Transplant Surgery. However, the hospital course has been complicated by ARDS, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, intracranial hemorrhage at ICP site, drug rash (all antimicrobials discontinued), and persistent fevers. Transplant was avoided, and the patient was extubated yesterday but experienced hypoxemia, leading to reintubation.

The patient is currently mechanically ventilated via endotracheal tube, awake, tracks with eyes, but does not attempt to speak or communicate. The patient requires hemodialysis and is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy. Allergies include Bactrim (oral). The patient has a history of liver failure and received antibiotics until 11/12/2187. The patient is receiving various ICU medications including fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure and recent development of hypoxemia. Physical examination findings include trace bilateral edema, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no jaundice or rash. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F with OCD (stable recently, but h/o OD, anorexia and alcohol use in
   past), ileostomy, with resolving fulminant liver failure, renal
   failure, hypoxic respiratory failure and intracranial hemorrhage.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial in etiology including ARDS
   / pulmonary edema / pleural effusions. CT confirms ground glass
   opacties and potential overlying infection with background pleural
   effusions.
   - Monitor I/Os via dialyis and diuresis. Will check pm I/Os with goal
   negative 1L.
   - F/U sputum cultures
   - bronch  Today
   - Holding ABx for now
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr on admission 4.4 now. Etiology remains unclear. DDx
   includes ATN, pre-renal, less likely AIN given negative. Urine
   Eosinophils.  Dialysis today. Renal following closely
   - F/U renal reccs
   - dialysis today
   .
   # Fevers: patient spike fever to 102 overnight.  WBC trending down from
   peak 25.  Sources still include line infections (Central, Dialysis
   Line, A-Line) UTI, lines, PNA, acalculus cholecystitis and
   and.meningitis. Nursing stated that dialysis line had small amount of
   drainage this AM. CT chest now being read as consolidation concerning
   for PNA. Holding Abx. Less likely drug fever given that precipitants
   have been pulled off. (Vanc / Zosyn / Fluc)
   - discuss with renal regarding potential replacement of dialysis line.
   - pull Central
   - Considering pulling A-Line
   - hold of on abx
   - bronch today
   - LP today
   - trend CBC and obtain diff
   - trending lipase/amylse (decreasing)
   - trending LFTs
   - Stool Studies sent
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with Resp compensation: Bicarb 17 today. Metabolic
   acidosis is likely secondary to ostomy drainage and bicarb loss, ARF
   also may be contributing. Small gap reamins possibly [**3-3**] uremia. [**Month (only) 8**] be
   potentially worsening pt
s status for extubation as she may be
   overbreathing secondary to metabolic acidosis. Should correct Acid-Base
   status prior to extubation.
   -          Begin Loperimide to attempt to slow down Bicarb loss
   -          Serial Chemistries
   -          Will consider oral bicarb if continues to worsen.
   .
   # Hepatic Failure: Resolving. Hepatology following.
   - Trending LFT's
   .
   # Right frontal subcortical hemorrhage/ Edema: [**3-3**] intracranial bolt
   and coagulopathy. Stable Head CT overnight (wet read)
   - on keppra for 10 day course starting [**11-8**]
   - Keeping PLT>100 per neurosurgery
   - f/u final head CT read
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: reveiew by hematology and thought to be secondary
   to alloimmunization and possible hypersplenism
   - f/u with blood bank re HLA matching
   .
   # Drug Rash: Resolved. Thought to be [**3-3**] Zosyn but Vanc or fluconazole
   also possible
   .
   # Anemia: has been running 25-30, iron/ TIBC ratio 17% indicating mild
   iron deficiency. Hct 24.8
   - follow HCT's
   - Transfuse <21
   - iron supplements
   .
   # Access: Will d/c IJ, A-Line. Place peripherals. Discuss with renal
   potentially changing dialysis line..
   # FEN: replete lytes prn, tube feeds via dobhoff (adjusted today)
   # PPx: subq heparin, lansoprazole
   # Access: PIV
   # Code: presumed full

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 37-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with liver failure. The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim) and has undergone multiple antibiotic courses including Ciprofloxacin and Fluconazole. The patient is currently on various medications such as Pantoprazole (Protonix) and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis). 

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever with a maximum temperature of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit and a current temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, but their heart rate is elevated at 111 beats per minute. The respiratory rate is normal, and the patient's oxygen saturation is at 97%. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,881 mL and output of 2,239 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 358 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The tidal volume is set at 465 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 8 cmH2O, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%. The patient's respiratory system compliance is good with a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 61. 

Physical examination findings include an undetermined peripheral vascular assessment due to the lack of pulses assessed, unassessed skin, and an unassessed neurologic examination. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) and creatinine (Cr), as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hct) and platelets (Plt). Other lab abnormalities include increased levels of lactate, D-dimer, and lactic acid, along with decreased levels of albumin and magnesium (Mg++). 

The patient's assessment includes ongoing management in the ICU with nutritional support, glycemic control, and dialysis catheter placement. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are also being implemented. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis due to the presence of fever and elevated WBC count, hepatic encephalopathy related to the patient's liver failure, and further deterioration of renal function indicated by the increased levels of creatinine. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening lung function or ventilator-associated complications. 

Please note that the patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: Pt is a 52F with OCD (stable recently, but h/o OD,
   anorexia and alcohol use in past), ileostomy, with resolving fulminant
   liver failure, renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure and
   intracranial hemorrhage.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: A-a gradient of 148, PA02/Fio2 267 c/w acute
   lung injury. thought to be secondary to ARDS but CT now with evidence
   of consolidation concerning for PNA.
   - diuresis: lasix 80mg IV x 1
   - sputum cultures
   - bronch in am
   - obtain CBC with diff
   - defer abx unless clinical picture changes, will avoid Zosyn given ?
   of drug rash
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr on admission 3.4 likely due to tylenol toxicity vs
   hepatorenal vs ATN, followed by renal team and has had CVVH; Cr now
   4.4. last dialyzed on [**11-13**]. Urine output 600 today. Worsening
   creatinine for unclear reasons. FEna 16% and FeUrea 75% suggesting that
   this is not pre-renal or due to overdiuresis. Consider AIN in the
   setting of fever and rash.
   - appreciate renal reccs
   - obtain urine eos
   .
   # Fevers: patient spike fever to 102 on [**11-7**] and 101 [**11-8**], pan culture
   negative. has had low grade temps 99.9-100.8 since [**11-9**], with tmax
   101.4 today.  WBC trending down from peak 25 on [**11-10**] -> 11 today, +
   left shift with 90% segs. CT chest now being read as consolidation
   concerning for PNA, but patient's WBC has actually trended down. Vanc
   and Zosyn dc'ed on [**11-9**]. Sources include UTI, lines, PNA, acalculus
   cholecystitis and, given recent intracranial instrumentation,
   meningitis or brain abcess. It is also possible that this is a drug
   fever in the setting of a rash.
   - hold of on abx
   - send blood cultures, UA, urine Cx, c.diff, sputum cx
   - bronch in am
   - trend CBC and obtain diff
   - head CT to evaluate for mass effect, if no mass effect consider LP;
   can not obtain CT with contrast or MRI with gad given ARF
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis with resp compensation: ph 7.41,pCO2 28, bicarb
   16. Per winter's formula, expected pC0 is 30 indicated just slight over
   complensation. Metabolic acidosis is likely [**3-3**] renal failure and
   uremia. Pt has a small gap of 4; lactate nl, possibly [**3-3**] uremia.
   .
   # Hepatic Failure: Resolving. Thought to be secondary to tylenol vs
   bactrim. Peak AST 9582, ALT [**Numeric Identifier 1266**], bili 6.9, INR 5.6, PTT 129 which
   have now improved to PTT 36, INR 1.2, ALt 94, AST 54, bilirubin 3.1.
   The patient was evaluated by transplant but now no longer requires
   liver transplant.
   - follow LFT's

   # Right frontal subcortical hemorrhage/ Edema: [**3-3**] intracranial bolt
   and coagulopathy. Bolt removed on [**2187-11-5**]. Edema tx'd with mannitol.
   Size of hemorrhage remains stable.
   - on keppra for 10 day course starting [**11-8**]
   - keep PLT>100 per neurosurgery
   - repeat head CT

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of OCD, ileostomy, resolving fulminant liver failure, renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and intracranial hemorrhage. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has an A-a gradient of 148 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 267, indicating severe hypoxemia. There is evidence of consolidation on the CT scan, which is concerning for pneumonia (PNA). The patient may require bronchoscopy and further antibiotic therapy.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened despite CVVH, suggesting that the renal failure is not pre-renal or due to overdiuresis. AIN (Acute Interstitial Nephritis) should be considered in the setting of fever and rash. The patient's urine output is 600 mL/day, and FENa is 16% with FeUrea 75%.
3. Fevers: The patient has had a persistent low-grade temperature since November 9th, with a peak temperature of 101.4 today. The WBC count has trended down, but there is still evidence of consolidation on the CT chest, suggesting a possible source of infection such as PNA. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures should be obtained.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is showing signs of fever with a temperature of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has a history of liver failure and allergies to Bactrim. The patient received non-contrast CT of the head, and all cultures were sent for pan culture. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and a respiratory rate within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,881 mL and output of 2,239 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 358 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Liver enzymes such as AST and ALT are elevated, as well as bilirubin levels. Kidney function tests reveal elevated creatinine levels, while electrolytes show imbalances in sodium, potassium, and calcium levels. Other lab results indicate elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and lactic acid levels.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 61. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows normal oxygenation but slightly lower carbon dioxide levels.

Physical examination findings include the patient being thin, with normal cardiovascular and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, encephalopathy, s/p fulminant hepatic failure
   complicated by acute renal failure and persistent fevers.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  multifactorial; evidence for diffuse alveolitis
   or fluid [pulmonary edema, cardiogenic (bilateral effusions) and/or
   non-cardiogenic --> at risk for ARDS, neurogenic pulmonary edema],
   pneumonia (bibasilar infiltrates).  Plan continue mechanical
   ventilation, net diuresis, monitor ABG.  Work towards SBT, follow RSBI.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1815**], but may be ATN (also possible
   drug-related or AIN).  Non-oliguric; plan for continued net diuresis
   and dialysis as needed)
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- poorly communicative.  Inconsistent responses
   (nods) [**Month (only) 8**] be consequence of increased intracranial pressure,
   encephalopathy.  Need to exclude
   FEVERS -- multiple possible sources, including VAP, line-related
   infection (esp. left SC catheter, left groind catheter), biliary
   infection (rising alk phos), pancreatitis (elevated amylase/lipase), or
   CNS infection.  Also consider drug-related fever.  Check WBC
   differential.  Bronchoscopy.  LP.  Would like to remove central lines,
   and resite dialysis catheter.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF @ goal.
   HEPATIC FAILURE -- s/p fulminant failure, did not require liver
   transplant.
   ANEMIA -- ACD, phelebotomy.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, encephalopathy, and a history of fulminant hepatic failure complicated by acute renal failure and persistent fevers. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated, but remain non-communicative. The patient's condition is multifactorial, with evidence of diffuse alveolitis or fluid (pulmonary edema), pneumonia, and possible acute kidney injury. There are several potential sources for the fever, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, line-related infection, biliary infection, pancreatitis, or central nervous system infection. The patient requires continued mechanical ventilation, net diuresis, and dialysis as needed. Nutritional support is also necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) - due to diffuse alveolitis or fluid in the lungs.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) - a common infection in patients who are intubated for an extended period.
3. Line-Related Infection - infections associated with central lines and catheters.
4. Biliary Infection - infection of the bile ducts, indicated by rising alkaline phosphatase levels.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) - possible cause of renal failure in this patient.
6. Drug-Related Complications - potential adverse effects of medications administered to the patient.
7. Central Nervous System Infection - infection affecting the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, encephalopathy, s/p fulminant hepatic failure
   complicated by acute renal failure and persistent fevers.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  multifactorial; evidence for diffuse alveolitis
   or fluid [pulmonary edema, cardiogenic (bilateral effusions) and/or
   non-cardiogenic --> at risk for ARDS, neurogenic pulmonary edema],
   pneumonia (bibasilar infiltrates).  Plan continue mechanical
   ventilation, net diuresis, monitor ABG.  Work towards SBT, follow RSBI.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- unclear [**Name2 (NI) 1815**], but may be ATN (also possible
   drug-related or AIN).  Non-oliguric; plan for continued net diuresis
   and dialysis as needed)
   NEUROLOGICAL STATUS -- poorly communicative.  Inconsistent responses
   (nods) [**Month (only) 8**] be consequence of increased intracranial pressure,
   encephalopathy.  Need to exclude
   FEVERS -- multiple possible sources, including VAP, line-related
   infection (esp. left SC catheter, left groind catheter), biliary
   infection (rising alk phos), pancreatitis (elevated amylase/lipase), or
   CNS infection.  Also consider drug-related fever.  Check WBC
   differential.  Bronchoscopy.  LP.  Would like to remove central lines,
   and resite dialysis catheter.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF @ goal.
   HEPATIC FAILURE -- s/p fulminant failure, did not require liver
   transplant.
   ANEMIA -- ACD, phelebotomy.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is evidence of diffuse alveolitis or fluid in the lungs, which may be causing pulmonary edema. Pneumonia is also a possibility with bibasilar infiltrates.

2. Encephalopathy: The patient's neurological status is poorly communicative, with inconsistent responses. Increased intracranial pressure and encephalopathy are possible causes for these symptoms.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to ATN (acute tubular necrosis), drug-related causes, or AIN (acute interstitial nephritis). Non-oliguric with continued net diuresis and dialysis as needed.

4. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be due to various sources such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), line-related infection, biliary infection, pancreatitis, or CNS infection. Drug-related fever is also a possibility. Further investigations, such as bronchoscopy and lumbar puncture, may be needed to identify the source of infection.

5. Hepatic failure: The patient had a previous episode of fulminant hepatic failure but did not require a liver transplant.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is attributed to acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-inch, 39 kg female with a history of liver failure, on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been febrile and underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. The arterial line was stopped, and blood cultures were obtained from the left subclavian central line and left femoral dialysis catheter. The patient has allergies to Bactrim and is currently on prophylactic heparin. The patient's medical and family history is unchanged from admission. Review of systems is also unchanged except for the recent events mentioned above.

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.8 degrees Fahrenheit) and current temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius (99.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The patient's heart rate is within normal range, with a slight variation of 96 beats per minute. Blood pressure is within normal range as well, ranging from 112/62 to 134/78 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within normal limits at 17 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Weight has increased from 37 kg at admission to 39 kg currently. Central venous pressure is low at 1 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 988 mL and output of 5,615 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 4,627 mL. Blood products totaling 415 mL were given"

   failure, hypoxic respiratory failure and intracranial hemorrhage.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial in etiology including ARDS
   / pulmonary edema / pleural effusions. CT confirms ground glass
   opacties and potential overlying infection with background pleural
   effusions.

   # Fevers: patient spike fever to 102 overnight.  WBC trending down from
   peak 25.  Sources still include line infections (Central, Dialysis
   Line, A-Line) UTI, lines, PNA, acalculus cholecystitis and
   and.meningitis. Nursing stated that dialysis line had small amount of
   drainage this AM. CT chest now being read as consolidation concerning
   for PNA. Holding Abx. Less likely drug fever given that precipitants
   have been pulled off. (Vanc / Zosyn / Fluc)
   - discuss with renal regarding potential replacement of dialysis line.

   # Metabolic acidosis with Resp compensation: Bicarb 17 today. Metabolic
   acidosis is likely secondary to ostomy drainage and bicarb loss, ARF
   also may be contributing. Small gap reamins possibly [**3-3**] uremia. [**Month (only) 8**] be
   potentially worsening pt
s status for extubation as she may be
   overbreathing secondary to metabolic acidosis. Should correct Acid-Base
   status prior to extubation.
   -          Begin Loperimide to attempt to slow down Bicarb loss
   -          Serial Chemistries

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of OCD, ileostomy, resolving fulminant liver failure, renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and intracranial hemorrhage. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, renal failure, fevers, metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, hepatic failure, right frontal subcortical hemorrhage/edema, thrombocytopenia, drug rash, anemia, and access issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure due to ARDS, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and potential underlying infection. Monitoring I/Os via dialysis and diuresis, checking for negative fluid balance, obtaining sputum cultures, performing bronchoscopy, and holding antibiotics for now are recommended.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating ongoing renal failure. The etiology of renal failure is unclear, and differential diagnoses include acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and less likely acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Dialysis today and close renal follow-up are advised.

3. Fevers: The patient had a spike fever overnight, and sources of infection may include line infections (central, dialysis line, arterial line), urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia (PNA), acalculous cholecyst"

   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial in etiology including ARDS
   / pulmonary edema / pleural effusions. CT confirms ground glass
   opacties and potential overlying infection with background pleural
   effusions. Had bronchoscopy yesterday which is negative to date.
   Appearance of fluid c/w possible DAH. CXR this am overall improved with
   increased aeration likely partly because dialyzed, negative 4.5 liters.
   UOP has also picked up recently. Currently on minimal vent settings,
   essentially tolerating SBT overnight
   - Monitor I/Os via dialyis and diuresis. Goal negative 1L. Try to
   minimize input given no HD access and pulm status much improved with
   net negative
   - F/U sputum, BAL cultures
   - Extubate today
   - Holding ABx for now given no obvious infectious process
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr 3.7 now after HD yesterday. Etiology remains
   unclear. DDx includes ATN, pre-renal, less likely AIN given negative.
   UOP has improved. Renal following closely, will try to hold off on
   dialysis to give line holiday until MOnday
   - F/U renal recs
   - dialysis Monday unless needs more acutely but no HD access
   .
   # Fevers: patient spiked fever overnight.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been [**3-3**] bronch.
   WBC trending down from peak 25 to 9.7.  Sources still include line
   infections (Central, Dialysis Line, A-Line) UTI, lines, PNA, acalculus
   cholecystitis and and.meningitis. No evidence of infection on LP or BAL
   making pneumonia, meningitis less likely. Nursing stated that dialysis
   line had small amount of drainage this AM. Holding Abx. Less likely
   drug fever given that precipitants have been pulled off. (Vanc / Zosyn
   / Fluc). Will need to follow fever curve since fever overnight may have
   been [**3-3**] bronch.
   - discussed with renal regarding potential replacement of dialysis
   line, will try to hold off until Monday to give line holiday.
   - pulled Central, HD, arterial line
   - hold of on abx
   - F/U culture results

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of OCD, ileostomy, and past issues with anorexia, alcohol use, and liver failure. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and intracranial hemorrhage. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial in etiology, including ARDS, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Her renal failure etiology remains unclear, with differential diagnoses including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and less likely acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient has also had fevers overnight, which may be attributed to line infections, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, or other sources. Her ECG changes are nonspecific and do not indicate cardiac ischemia. The patient's metabolic acidosis is secondary to ostomy drainage and bicarbonate loss, as well as renal failure. Her hepatic failure is resolving, and she has resolved thrombocytopenia, drug rash, and anemia. The patient's right frontal subcortical hemorrhage/edema is stable, and she has been prescribed anticonvulsant medication. The plan includes monitoring I/Os via dialysis and diuresis, following up with sputum and BAL cultures, and possibly extubating the patient today"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with liver failure and on dialysis in the ICU. The patient has been febrile and had an arterial line placed on 11/15/2187. Blood cultures were obtained from the arterial line, left subclavian central line, and femoral dialysis catheter. The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim and is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Vital signs show a fever, normal blood pressure, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 37 kg to 39 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 988 mL and output of 5,615 mL with a negative balance of -4,627 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a respiratory rate of 16, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 52. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, as well as low platelet count and albumin levels. Imaging is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and recent blood cultures suggest the possibility of an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction or injury,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU for several days and has experienced multiple medical complications. The patient has hepatic failure, renal failure, and encephalopathy. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's fever was evaluated and may be due to various sources. He is also on prophylactic medication for seizures. The patient's nutritional support includes tube feeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and persistent. It appears to be improving, but he still requires mechanical ventilation. There is a plan to work towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and possibly extubation.
2. Hepatic Failure: The patient has resolving hepatic failure. Monitoring will continue, but it seems to be improving.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is some improvement in urine output, and the patient is tolerating hemodialysis (HD).
4. Encephalopathy: The patient had elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to hepatic failure. The extent of CNS injury is unclear, and better assessment will be needed once the patient is extubated.
5. Fever: The patient had a fever following bronchoscopy, and multiple possible sources are being evaluated. The goal is to disconnect all lines.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with OCD, ileostomy, resolving fulminant liver failure, renal failure, resolving hypoxic respiratory failure, and intracranial hemorrhage. She was extubated and is currently on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen. Her urine output has improved, but she still requires close monitoring of her fluid and electrolyte balance due to fluid overload and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's central line, dialysis line, arterial line, and urinary catheter need to be evaluated for potential sources of infection. Her liver function tests are resolving, and she is being followed by hepatology. The patient's thrombocytopenia has resolved, but she still has mild iron deficiency anemia. She has a right frontal subcortical hemorrhage with edema, which is being managed with an intracranial bolt and coagulopathy. The patient's ECG changes are non-specific and do not indicate cardiac ischemia. Her metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to ostomy drainage and bicarbonate loss. The patient's overall condition is improving, but she requires ongoing monitoring and management of her various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had resolving hypoxic respiratory failure, and although she is now extubated, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if her pulmonary status deteriorates.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has ongoing renal failure with a"

   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial in etiology including ARDS
   / pulmonary edema / pleural effusions. CT confirms ground glass
   opacties and potential overlying infection with background pleural
   effusions. Had bronchoscopy yesterday which is negative to date.
   Appearance of fluid c/w possible DAH. CXR this am overall improved with
   increased aeration likely partly because dialyzed, negative 4.5 liters.
   UOP has also picked up recently. Currently on minimal vent settings,
   essentially tolerating SBT overnight
   - Monitor I/Os via dialyis and diuresis. Goal negative 1L. Try to
   minimize input given no HD access and pulm status much improved with
   net negative

   # Renal Failure: Cr 3.7 now after HD yesterday. Etiology remains
   unclear. DDx includes ATN, pre-renal, less likely AIN given negative.
   UOP has improved. Renal following closely, will try to hold off on
   dialysis to give line holiday until MOnday
   - F/U renal recs
   - dialysis Monday unless needs more acutely but no HD access
   .
   # Fevers: patient spiked fever overnight.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been [**3-3**] bronch.
   WBC trending down from peak 25 to 9.7.  Sources still include line
   infections (Central, Dialysis Line, A-Line) UTI, lines, PNA, acalculus
   cholecystitis and and.meningitis. No evidence of infection on LP or BAL
   making pneumonia, meningitis less likely. Nursing stated that dialysis
   line had small amount of drainage this AM. Holding Abx. Less likely
   drug fever given that precipitants have been pulled off. (Vanc / Zosyn
   / Fluc). Will need to follow fever curve since fever overnight may have
   been [**3-3**] bronch.

   likely cerebral TWI given h/o hemorrhage. Will trend biomarkers to R/O
   MI, follow serial ECGs, hold off on treatment for now (ASA, plavix,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of OCD, ileostomy, resolving fulminant liver failure, renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and intracranial hemorrhage.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on minimal ventilator settings and tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). There is a need to monitor I/Os via dialysis and diuresis, with a goal of negative 1L. The patient's pulmonary status has improved, but they still have pleural effusions and potential overlying infection.

2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is currently 3.7 after undergoing dialysis yesterday. The etiology of renal failure remains unclear, with possible causes including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, or less likely acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient's urine output has improved, and they will try to hold off on dialysis until Monday.

3. Fevers: The patient spiked a fever overnight, and the source could be line infections (central, dialysis line, arterial line), urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, or acalculous cholecystitis. No evidence of infection on lumbar puncture (LP) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) makes pneumonia and meningitis less likely. The dialysis line had a small amount of drainage this morning, which could indicate an infection.

4. ECG changes: The patient has diffuse twave inversions (TWI) on the ECG this morning. These TWIs do not correlate with vascular territories and are unlikely to be cardiac ischemia. They are more likely cerebral TWIs given the patient's history of hemorrhage. Biomarkers will be trended to rule out myocardial infarction (MI), and serial ECGs will be followed.

5. Metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation: The patient has metabolic acidosis secondary to ostomy drainage and bicarbonate loss, as well as acute kidney injury (AKI). A small gap remains, possibly due to uremia. Loperamide has been given to decrease ostomy output, and banana flakes have been added to the tube feeds (TF).

6. Hepatic failure: The patient's hepatic failure is resolving, but hepatology will be followed closely. Trending liver function tests (LFTs) is important.

7. Right frontal subcortical hemorrhage/edema: The patient has a stable head CT, and an intracranial bolt has been placed. Coagulopathy is being managed with a platelet count >100 per neurosurgery recommendation.

8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia has resolved"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-inch tall and 39 kg weight individual currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of liver failure, allergies to Bactrim, and a recent 500cc nasal bleed. The patient is receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis, other ICU medications, and infusions. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 122/68 to 132/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 9 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,254 mL, output of 1,880 mL, and a negative balance of -626 mL. The patient is not receiving respiratory support and has normal arterial blood gas values. Physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, but peripheral pulses and neurologic assessments are not evaluated. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and D-dimer levels, along with elevated liver enzymes and cardiac biomarkers. Additional lab values reveal imbalances in electrolytes, kidney function, and cardiac enzymes. The patient is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube, has multiple IV lines, and is on prophylactic measures for"

","The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including OCD, ileostomy, resolving fulminant liver failure, renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and intracranial hemorrhage. She is currently extubated and sating well on 2 liters of oxygen. Her urine output has recently improved, which may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of prior fluid overload. She remains afebrile and is not on antibiotics at this time.

The assessment and plan include monitoring her inputs and outputs via diuresis, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1 liter. The patient will be closely followed for renal function, and dialysis will be reassessed on Monday. Sputum and BAL cultures are being followed, and the decision to hold antibiotics will be reassessed based on culture results.

Her renal failure is likely secondary to ATN, and her creatinine level is stable at 4.1. Her urine output has improved, and she will continue to be closely monitored for renal function. Dialysis may be delayed until Monday to give a line holiday.

The previous fevers are resolved, and the potential source was the dialysis line. The patient still has central, dialysis, and arterial lines, as well as a urinary tract infection, which has been ruled out. Cholecystitis and meningitis have also been ruled out. Antibiotics have been held, and the decision to replace the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of OCD, ileostomy, and multiple medical conditions including fulminant liver failure, Tylenol overdose, renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and intracranial hemorrhage. She has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has had several complications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She is extubated and sating well on 2 liters of oxygen.

The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status, but still has ongoing renal failure with a creatinine level of 4.1. She has been diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and her urine output has improved. There is a plan to hold off on dialysis until Monday unless needed more acutely.

The patient was previously febrile, but is now afebrile. The source of the fever was potentially the dialysis line, which has been removed. Other potential sources of infection, such as urinary tract infection (UTI), lines, pneumonia (PNA), and cholecystitis, have been ruled out. Antibiotics have been held off for now.

The patient also has ECG changes with diffuse"
