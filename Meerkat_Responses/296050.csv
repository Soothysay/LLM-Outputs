   - Cardiology consult
   - Hold AC for now given recent surgery, discussed with surgical team
   - Place on verapamil gtt  for ease of titration off if patient becomes
   hypotensive
   - optimize pain control
   - treating infectious process empirically
   - may need central line
   - consider CTA chest if becomes hypoxemic to evaluate for PE if not
   clearly a volume overload issue
   .
   ARF: Baseline Cr of 1.5, likely a result of poorly controlled
   diabetes.  Current Cr this AM is 2.3 from 1.7 on transfer.  FENA 0.4%.
   Suspect this may be due to component infection combined with transient
   hypotension in setting afib/flutter RVR causing ischemia of renal
   medullary cells with possible component ATN.
   - check urine sediment
   - mantain euvolemic to slightly positive
   - hold diuretics for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CABG, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He presented to the ICU with his third episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient underwent cardiac surgery and umbilical hernia repair and is currently experiencing several medical complications. 

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR. Despite receiving multiple medications, including amiodarone, diltiazem, Lopressor, and verapamil, the patient's heart rate remains elevated. A cardiology consult has been placed.
2. Fever: The patient has had a fever with a maximum temperature of 102.4Â°F. The cause of the fever is currently unknown, but it could be due to post-surgical complications, atelectasis, drugs, or infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.5, but it has increased to 2.3 this morning. The FENA is 0.4%, suggesting a possible component infection combined with transient hypotension in the setting of atrial fibrillation/flutter RVR, leading to ischemia of renal medullary cells and possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's recent troponin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CABG, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU after undergoing cardiac surgery and umbilical hernia repair. The patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was initially treated with amiodarone, diltiazem, and Lopressor without success. Verapamil was then administered, which effectively controlled the heart rate. However, the patient's heart rate increased again, and another dose of verapamil was given along with pre-treatment of calcium gluconate. The patient's fever, elevated creatinine levels, and history of poorly controlled diabetes suggest acute renal failure (ARF), which may be due to a combination of component infection and transient hypotension caused by atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a known ejection fraction (EF) of 55% on recent echocardiogram. Other assessments and plans include managing the patient's diabetes, investigating the cause of his fever, monitoring for complications related to his recent surgery, and addressing his chronic venous ulcerations."

   persistent Aflutter at 150 with relatve hypotension. [**Month (only) 60**] actually be in
   flutter given rate of 150.  Has been bolused with 150mg of amiodarone
   x2 without much effect last night then tried dilt gtt- this has worked
   for him in the past but not now.
   Will try IV Verapamil drip with small po load, Consult cards, discuss
   role of CVL thoutgh with TR may not be that helpful in assessing vol
   status and CXR looks overloaded so would not favor blousing.
   Control all sympathetic tone, antipyretics, pain meds
   2. ARF: ddx pre renal versus ATN, got IVF in OR and is maintaining UOP
   2. Fever: No definite source of infection, but recently post-op with

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), and currently recovering from a cholecystectomy with conversion to open surgery due to a complication. He is also experiencing an inguinal hernia repair. The patient is experiencing hypotension and persistent atrial flutter at a rate of 150 beats per minute (flutter). He has been given multiple doses of amiodarone without significant effect. Verapamil has been tried with some improvement, but the effect is not sustained. The patient also has a fever of up to 102.4Â°F and is on antibiotics empirically for suspected infection. His vital signs are unstable with fluctuating blood pressure, elevated heart rate, low oxygen saturation, and altered respiratory rate. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, potassium, and troponin levels, indicating possible acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal failure. The patient's blood glucose level is high, and there are abnormalities in liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent atrial flutter with relative hypotension: The patient's persistent atrial flutter at a rate of 150 beats per minute may lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion, resulting in hypotension. This could potentially progress to cardiogenic shock if not adequately managed.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or"

The patient is currently experiencing hypotension and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He has been given multiple doses of amiodarone without effect and is now being switched to diltiazem. The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and cardiac enzymes are being cycled. The patient is also showing signs of acute renal failure (ARF), with a potential diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He is receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and maintaining urine output. The patient has a fever but no definite source of infection, possibly related to post-operative complications such as bile in the abdomen. Empiric antibiotics (Vanc, Zosyn, Flagyl) have been started. The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is on Lantus insulin and RISS. A wound consult has been requested for chronic ulceration. In the ICU, the patient is on mechanical ventilation (MPO post-op) and will continue to be monitored closely."

   Assessment and Plan
   62M with hx of CABG, HTN, IDDM, POD1 from CCY and umbilical hernia
   repair transferred from 12R with his third episode of afib w/RVR
   RHYTHM: patient appears to be in Afib w/RVR, last ECg actually shows
   atrial flutter at 3:1, multiple reasons to go into afib/flutter due to
   recent post op, infection, overload, less likely PE
   - converted SR 7pm
    - SR, continue Lopressor
   - add amiodarone 200mg PO BID for 7 days
   - cardiology following
   - consider CTA chest if becomes hypoxemic to evaluate for PE if not
   clearly a volume overload issue
   .
   ARF: Baseline Cr of 1.5, likely a result of poorly controlled
   diabetes.  Current Cr this AM is 2.4 from 1.7 on transfer.  FENA 0.4%.
   Suspect this may be due to component infection combined with transient
   hypotension in setting afib/flutter RVR causing ischemia of renal
   medullary cells with possible component ATN.
   - diurese, if not negative by early afternoon, give IV lasix
   - goal 1 liter negative today, given volume overload
   - will benefit from increased perfussion to kidneys given in SR
   .
    CAD: causes of afib can be due to infarction.  Patient with slightly
   elevated Tn with flat CK.  Will continue Statin
   - ruled out for ACS with serial enzymes and ECG
   - ASA daily
   .
   PUMP: Known EF of 55% on recent ECHO.  Will hold antihypertensives.
   - repeat TTE EF 70%, likely diastolic HF given HTN
   .
   Diabetes: HbA1c of 7.3 in [**2153-2-17**] with peripheral neuropathy and
   retinopathy.
   - continue Lantus 31U qhs and Regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   Fevers: Unknown etiology at this point, but could be post surgical,
   atelectasis, drugs, or infection, among others.  Will empirically
   continue with Zosyn/Vanco as per past sensitivites.
   - continue Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
   - f/u cultures NGTD
   - cx if spikes
   .
   CCY/Umbilical hernia repair: Patient appears to be hemodynamically
   stable since surgery aside from rhythm issues.  Surgery will continue
   to follow closely.
   -          Continue morphine PCA for pain control,  stopped basal rated
   given somewhat somnolent
   -          Incentive spirometry
   .
   Anemia: post operative, check PM CBC, check iron labs
   Chronic venous ulcerations: Will dress daily.  Wound Consult placed

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after undergoing a cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CCY) with umbilical hernia repair. The patient presented with his third episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR) and atrial flutter. 

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature of 38.9Â°C (102Â°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 139/66 mmHg to 152/120 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 118 kg, and his height is 71 inches. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 24.3%, platelet count of 178 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 170 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.08 ng/mL, and his sodium level is 135 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated levels of CK, CKMB, and LDH, as well as slightly low levels of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. 

The patient's medical history includes poorly controlled diabetes, which may have contributed to acute renal failure (ARF) with a baseline creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and current creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL. The fractional excretion of sodium (FENA) is 0.4%, suggesting a possible component of infection combined with transient hypotension in the setting of AFib/RVR causing ischemia of renal medullary cells with possible component acute tubular necrosis (ATN). 

The patient's cardiac history includes a known ejection fraction (EF) of 55% on recent echocardiogram, but a repeat TTE EF is 70%, indicating diastolic heart failure likely due to hypertension. 

The patient's diabetes management includes ongoing use of Lantus insulin 31 units at bedtime and regular insulin sliding scale. 

The patient's fevers are of unknown etiology, but could be post-surgical, atelectasis, drugs, or infection, among others. Empirical coverage with Zosyn/Vanco as per past sensitivities has been continued, with plans to follow up with cultures and chest X-ray if warranted. 

The patient's surgical history includes CCY and umbilical hernia repair, and he appears to be hemodynam"

   62M with hx of CABG, HTN, IDDM, POD1 from CCY and umbilical hernia
   repair transferred from 12R with his third episode of afib w/RVR
   RHYTHM: patient appears to be in Afib w/RVR, last ECg actually shows
   atrial flutter at 3:1, multiple reasons to go into afib/flutter due to
   recent post op, infection, overload, less likely PE
   -Received 150mg IV amiodarone twice. Then 10mg IV diltiazem, followed
   by gtt to 15mg/hr. Then Lopressor 5mg IV times 2. HR persisted in 150s,
   then was given verapamil 10mg IVx1 and had excellent response to HR
   90s. Was then given 50mg PO lopressor and eventually HR still climbed
   back into 150s by 7am
   - Was given another 10mg IV verapamil with pre-treatment with 2gm IV
   calcium gluconate
   - Cardiology consult
   - Hold AC for now given recent surgery, discussed with surgical team
   - Place on verapamil gtt  for ease of titration off if patient becomes
   hypotensive
   - optimize pain control
   - treating infectious process empirically
   - may need central line
   - consider CTA chest if becomes hypoxemic to evaluate for PE if not
   clearly a volume overload issue
   .
   ARF: Baseline Cr of 1.5, likely a result of poorly controlled
   diabetes.  Current Cr this AM is 2.3 from 1.7 on transfer.  FENA 0.4%.
   Suspect this may be due to component infection combined with transient
   hypotension in setting afib/flutter RVR causing ischemia of renal
   medullary cells with possible component ATN.
   - check urine sediment
   - mantain euvolemic to slightly positive
   - hold diuretics for now
   .
    CAD: causes of afib can be due to infarction.  Patient with slightly
   elevated Tn with flat CK.  Will continue Statin
   - ruled out for ACS with serial enzymes and ECG
   - ASA daily
   .
   PUMP: Known EF of 55% on recent ECHO.  Will hold antihypertensives and
   Bumex at this time.
   .
   Diabetes: HbA1c of 7.3 in [**2153-2-17**] with peripheral neuropathy and
   retinopathy.
   - continue Lantus 31U qhs and Regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   Fevers: Unknown etiology at this point, but could be post surgical,
   atelectasis, drugs, or infection, among others.  Will empirically
   continue with Zosyn/Vanco as per past sensitivites.
   - continue Vanco/Zosyn, added flagyl yesterday
   - f/u cultures
   .
   CCY/Umbilical hernia repair: Patient appears to be hemodynamically
   stable since surgery aside from rhythm issues.  Surgery will continue
   to follow closely.
   -          Continue morphine PCA for pain control, add basal rate
   -          Incentive spirometry
   .
   Anemia: post operative, check PM CBC
   Chronic venous ulcerations: Will dress daily.  Wound Consult placed

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CABG, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He is currently in the ICU after undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and umbilical hernia repair. The patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which was initially treated with amiodarone and diltiazem. However, the patient's heart rate persisted in the 150s, so verapamil was administered with a good response, achieving a heart rate of 90s. The patient was then started on oral metoprolol and eventually his heart rate climbed back into the 150s. Another dose of verapamil was given along with pretreatment of calcium gluconate. A cardiology consult was ordered. The patient's pain control is being optimized, and the infectious process is being treated empirically with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. A central line may be necessary. The patient's recent creatinine levels have increased from 1.7 to 2.3, indicating acute kidney injury (ARF), likely due to a combination of component infection and transient hypotension during atrial fibrillation/RVR. Renal function is being closely monitored, and urine sediment is being checked. The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.5, and FENA is 0.4%. The patient's diabetes is being managed with Lantus and regular"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of RVR (likely referring to right ventricular failure), hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has undergone several interventions and tests.

From the note, it appears that the patient's condition has been unstable, with repeated episodes of fever and changes in vital signs. The patient's temperature has been consistently elevated, ranging from 38.9Â°C to 102.0Â°F. Blood cultures were taken on 04/25/2153 at 05:38 PM, indicating a concern for infection.

The patient's blood pressure has fluctuated, with readings ranging from 126/65 mmHg to 152/120 mmHg. Heart rate has been within normal limits, but respiratory rate is on the higher end of the normal range. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 96% with the use of a nasal cannula.

The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission, with a current weight of 118 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,092 mL and output of 1,950 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating some fluid loss.

Regarding lab results, the patient has an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and decreased platelet count. Creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting impaired kidney function. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, indicating no ongoing myocardial infarction. Glucose levels are elevated,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and previous open cholecystectomy (CCY) and umbilical hernia repair. He is currently admitted to the ICU for his third episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient has experienced a precipitous drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 24.3% to 22.5% within 24 hours. This drop is concerning for anemia, potentially due to iron deficiency, as indicated by low ferritin levels and previous outpatient iron therapy. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) remains at 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.8Â°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/59 to 144/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry reading of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 118 kg, with a height of 71 inches.

The patient has received various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole. His fluid balance shows an intake of 2,423 mL, including 230 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TF), and an output of 3,966 mL, including 690 mL of urine output. The patient's blood products have been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

The patient's lab results reveal a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 10.1 to 13.1 thousand cells/mmÂ³, hemoglobin (Hb) levels from 7.6 to 19.2 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count from 164 to 226 thousand cells/mmÂ³, creatinine (Cr) levels from 1.7 to 2.4 mg/dL, troponin-T levels from 0.08 to 0.10 ng/mL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels from 31 to 34 mg/dL, glucose levels from 135 to 172 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including potassium (K+) levels from 3.3 to 5.3 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) levels from 134 to 142 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) levels from 96 to 104 mEq/L, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels from 19.2 to 22.5 mEq/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anemia: The patient's HCT drop suggests anemia, which could be due to iron deficiency. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygen saturation"

   clearly a volume overload issue
   - hold coumadin given drop HCT
   - ASA
   .
   ARF: Baseline Cr of 1.5, likely a result of poorly controlled diabetes.
   FENA 0.4%. Suspect this may be due to component infection combined with
   transient hypotension in setting afib/flutter RVR causing ischemia of
   renal medullary cells with possible component ATN.
   - Cr back down to baseline
   - diurese with home bumex dose, negative 1.5 liters yesterday

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension (HTN), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and a recent operation for cholecystectomy (CCY) and umbilical hernia repair. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to his third episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib w/RVR).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 38.2 degrees Celsius, current temperature (Tcurrent) of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 133/59 mmHg to 144/67 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 8 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%, and sinus rhythm (SR) heart rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,423 mL of total fluids, with 1,140 mL given orally, 1,283 mL given intravenously, and 230 mL given through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The output includes 3,966 mL of urine, -1,543 mL of fluid balance deficit, and -460 mL of drain output.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 6.5 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 226 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 31 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.3 mg/dL, glucose of 170 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4.2 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 134 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 96 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 7.4 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.0 mg/dL, phosphate (PO4) of 2.4 mg/dL, and albumin of 3.0 g/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Anemia: The patient has a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, which is consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The patient should be transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and placed back on iron supplementation.

2. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but there is a concern for future episodes of atrial fibrillation. The plan includes continuing Lopressor, adding amiodarone 200mg orally twice a day for 7 days, and consulting cardiology for further evaluation.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR) following a planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy that was converted to an open procedure. He has a history of anemia, and his hemoglobin level is 6.5 g/dL. The patient is hemodynamically stable, with vital signs within normal range. He is currently receiving prophylactic heparin and other medications. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His creatinine level is slightly elevated, but trending down. The patient has been experiencing fevers, and empiric antibiotics have been started. There is a concern for hematoma in the gallbladder fossa, which may be old. The patient is at risk for respiratory complications due to compression of airways by an enlarged liver and elevated hemidiaphragm on the right side. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with insulin and medication. A consult for wound care has been requested for chronic ulceration. The patient's family has been informed about his condition and the plan is to transfer him to the floor once stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma expansion or rupture: The concern for hematoma in the gallbladder fossa needs to be monitored closely, as it can potentially expand or rupture, leading to further complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with atrial fibrillation (afib) and rapid ventricular response (RVR) who underwent a planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy but was converted to an open procedure. The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (HCT) level of 17, and there are concerns about a hematoma in the gallbladder fossa. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and will have a stat abdominal computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the hematoma. The patient's coagulation profile is being monitored, and he is on heparin prophylaxis.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation, for which a cardiology consult has been requested. Chemical cardioversion with ibutilide was attempted, and the patient was successfully converted back to sinus rhythm. Low-dose amiodarone is being started.

The patient is experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), and the differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is being closely monitored for urine output (UOP) and trends in creatinine, which remains stable at 2.4 but above baseline.

The patient has fevers, with a downward trend. No definitive source of infection has been identified, but there are concerns about post-operative complications such as bile in the abdomen. The patient is on empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin,"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Large hematoma extending from the gallbladder fossa inferiorly. High
   density within the upper portion of the hematoma likely represents more
   acute
   bleeding. Active extravasation cannot be assessed without IV contrast.
   2. Second pocket of fluid anterior to the left lobe of the liver
   containing
   air pockets and heterogeneous fluid, likely postoperative sequelae, but
   possibly communicating with the large hematoma in the gallbladder
   fossa.
   3. Bilateral pleural effusions and lung base airspace opacities which
   could
   represent extensive atelectasis. Other considerations include
   aspiration or
   pneumonia.
   4. Unchanged appearance of enlarged kidneys with perinephric stranding,
   consistent with renal disease as discussed on recent ultrasound
   examinations.
   5. Stable appearance of calcified splenic lesion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CABG, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 1. He underwent cholecystectomy and umbilical hernia repair surgery. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has anemia with a precipitous drop in hemoglobin concentration, which may be due to iron deficiency. He also has renal failure, possibly as a result of poorly controlled diabetes. The patient's cardiac function is normal, and his diabetes management plan should be continued. He has fevers of unknown etiology, and antibiotics have been started empirically. The patient's surgical wounds are being monitored closely, and wound care will be provided. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient had a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration and a hematoma extending from the gallbladder fossa inferiorly with high density within the upper portion, indicating more acute bleeding. This could lead to further bleeding complications.
2. Renal failure: The patient has an elevated baseline creatinine level and a recent acute decline in kidney function. This may be due to component infection combined with transient hypotension in the setting of atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response, causing ischemia of renal medullary cells and possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). He is currently in the ICU after undergoing cholecystectomy (CCY) and umbilical hernia repair. The patient experienced a significant drop in hematocrit (HCT) and was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He has been placed on hold for coumadin, ASA, and heparin SQ. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR), and he is being continued on Lopressor. Amiodarone 200mg PO BID for 7 days has been added, and cardiology follow-up has been scheduled. The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr) level is 1.5, likely due to poorly controlled diabetes. He has a FENA of 0.4%, suggesting possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib/RVR). The patient's cardiac ejection fraction (EF) is known to be 55% on recent echocardiogram (ECHO), but it has now improved to 70%, indicating diastolic heart failure given hypertension. The patient's HbA1c level was 7.3 on [**2153-2-17**], indicating peripheral neuropathy and retin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CABG, HTN, IDDM, and recent surgery for CCY and umbilical hernia repair. He was transferred to the ICU due to his third episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct) yesterday, which was attributed to bleeding in the gallbladder fossa. Surgery did not intervene, and the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), resulting in stable Hct levels.

Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct drop indicates acute anemia due to the GB fossa bleed. Iron deficiency is confirmed by iron labs, and the patient is on outpatient iron therapy. The goal Hct is set at 27, with transfusion for Hct less than 24 indicating active bleeding. The patient will continue iron supplementation orally when having bowel movements and will be closely monitored by surgery.
2. Rhythm: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm (SR), but has had three episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He will continue on Lopressor and be started on amiodarone 200mg PO BID for 7 days. Cardiology will follow up, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) chest may be considered if the patient becomes hypoxemic to evaluate for pulmonary embolism"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous percutaneous atrial fibrillation (PAF) who underwent an open cholecystectomy that was initially planned as laparoscopic. The patient is currently in the ICU from being transferred from the floor. He presented with a rapid aflutter and hemodynamic stability. He did not respond to amiodarone, diltiazem, lopressor, or verapamil for rate control. After receiving 2 mg of ibutilide, he was successfully converted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient is now on oral amiodarone and lopressor per electrophysiology recommendations.

The patient's pain medications and antipyretics have been given due to no definite source of infection, although there is a question of bile leak during surgery. Empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl have been started, and the overall fever curve is trending down. The patient has a chronically elevated right hemidiaphragm with compression of the right lower lobe airways, increasing the risk of pneumonia. Acute kidney injury (ARF) is suspected to be either pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and the patient is autodiuresing with creatinine returning to baseline. The patient is volume overloaded, so bumex has been restarted. The hemoglobin (H"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous cardiac surgeries, including CABG and open chest surgery for atrial fibrillation (PAF). He was transferred to the ICU from the floor with complaints of a rapid heartbeat (aflutter) and a drop in hematocrit (Hct). The patient's fever has been resolved, and he is currently in sinus rhythm after being converted back from atrial fibrillation using ibutilide. His Hct levels are now stable after receiving a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient has a hematoma on the abdominal CT but does not require surgical intervention. There are bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, possibly due to the compression of right lower lobe airways by an elevated right hemidiaphragm. The patient is autodiuresing and has been incentive spirometer trained. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and is being managed with insulin and diet. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and he is awake and alert. Potential medical complications that can arise include anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure (ARF), fevers of unknown origin, hypoxemia, and fluid overload."

   62 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG and PAF s/p open CCY (lap converted to
   open) and hernia repair on [**4-23**] transferred to ICU from floor with
   aflutter, HD stable.  Now back in NSR.  Other issues have been fevers,
   now resolved/source unclear, and Hct drop, now stable after transfusion
   of 2U PRBC.
   1. Anemia: Hct 17-19 yest am, now stable (~27) on past 3 checks after
   2U PRBC.  Hematoma on abd CT, but surgery feels no need to intervene.
   Decrease Hct checks to [**Hospital1 **], tf for Hct<24.  Restart asa coumadin when
   ok per surgery.
   2 Afib: Did not respond to amio 150 x2, dilt gtt, lopressor, or
   verapamil gtt.  Finally converted back to NSR hours after receiving 2mg
   ibutilide on [**4-25**] afternoon.  Now on po amio and lopressor and still in
   SR.  Plan to cont amio x7d per EP.
   3 ARF: ddx pre renal versus ATN, now starting to autodiurese and Cr
   back to b/l
   4 Fevers: now afebrile x 48hrs.  Never had definite source of
   infection, but recently post-op with question of bile leak in abdomen.
   Hematoma also possible nidus for infection.  Finally, chronically
   elevated R hemi-diaphragm w/compression of RLL airways --> increased
   risk pna.  All cxs NGTD.  Empiric 7d course of vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.
   5.  DM2: Cont lantus (increase given elevated BS yest) + RISS.
   6.  Hypoxemia - likely [**1-20**] vol overload, pleural effusions,
   atelectasis, splinting.  Autodiuresing (on home bumex).  OOB to chair,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and pulmonary artery fistula repair. He also had a hernia repair on April 23rd. The patient was transferred to the ICU from the floor with complaints of a rapid aflutter and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct).

The patient experienced unexplained Hct drop yesterday, which was stable after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). A CT scan showed a large hematoma in the gallbladder fossa, and surgery did not intervene. The patient also had bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral atelectasis, which could be due to infiltrate or other causes.

The patient's vital signs are generally stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C (98.9Â°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/57 to 166/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and is being managed with insulin and dietary restrictions. He also has a history of congestive heart failure and is on bumex, a diuretic.

   Pulmonary: persistently hypoxic and requiring 3L NC.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   splinting.  Pain control, IS.  Keep net out today as tolerated.
   Autodiuresing currently.
   .
   ARF: Baseline Cr of 1.5, likely a result of poorly controlled diabetes.
   FENA 0.4%. Suspect this may be due to component infection combined with
   transient hypotension in setting afib/flutter RVR causing ischemia of
   renal medullary cells with possible component ATN.
   - Cr back down to baseline
   - diurese with home bumex dose, negative 1.5 liters yesterday
   - volume overload
   - will benefit from increased perfussion to kidneys given in SR
   .
   CAD: causes of afib can be due to infarction.  Patient with slightly
   elevated Tn with flat CK.  Will continue Stati
   - ruled out for ACS with serial enzymes and ECG
   - ASA daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CABG, hypertension, and IDDM. He was admitted to the ICU for his third episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient also had a gastrointestinal bleed resulting in acute anemia, for which he received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His hemoglobin (Hct) level is currently stable. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.1Â°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/58 mmHg to 155/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

The patient is receiving several medications, including amiodarone, metoprolol, oxycodone as needed, bumex, albuterol, and pantoprazole. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct level dropped due to a gastrointestinal bleed. He received PRBCs and his Hct is now stable. Iron deficiency anemia is suspected, and the patient will be placed on iron supplementation as an outpatient. Transfusion criteria will be based on H"

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CABG, HTN, IDDM, and POD1 from CCY and umbilical hernia repair. He presented to the ICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR) and a gastrointestinal bleed from the greater curvature of the stomach. The patient's Hct has stabilized at 27% after experiencing acute anemia intra and post-operatively. He is currently on various medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, trazodone, atorvastatin, PPI, bumex, albuterol, and oxycodone as needed.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.1Â°F), current temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/58 mmHg to 155/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.33.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished, not in acute distress, and overweight/obese. His cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds without any murmurs. His peripheral vascular examination is unremarkable.

   62 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG and PAF s/p open CCY (lap converted to
   open) and hernia repair on [**4-23**] transferred to ICU from floor with
   aflutter, HD stable.  Now back in NSR.  Other issues have been fevers,
   now resolved/source unclear, and Hct drop, now stable after transfusion
   of 2U PRBC.
   1. Anemia: Hct 17-19 yest am, now stable (~27) on past 3 checks after
   2U PRBC.  Hematoma on abd CT, but surgery feels no need to intervene.
   Decrease Hct checks to [**Hospital1 **], tf for Hct<24.  Restart asa coumadin when
   ok per surgery.
   2 Afib: Did not respond to amio 150 x2, dilt gtt, lopressor, or
   verapamil gtt.  Finally converted back to NSR hours after receiving 2mg
   ibutilide on [**4-25**] afternoon.  Now on po amio and lopressor and still in
   SR.  Plan to cont amio x7d per EP.
   3 ARF: ddx pre renal versus ATN, now starting to autodiurese and Cr
   back to b/l
   4 Fevers: now afebrile x 48hrs.  Never had definite source of
   infection, but recently post-op with question of bile leak in abdomen.
   Hematoma also possible nidus for infection.  Finally, chronically
   elevated R hemi-diaphragm w/compression of RLL airways --> increased

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and pulmonary artery flutter mapping (PAF) with open chest procedure. He also had a hernia repair on April 23rd. The patient was transferred to the ICU from the floor due to atrial flutter and hemodynamic instability, but is now back in normal sinus rhythm. The patient experienced fevers, which have since resolved, and a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) level, which has stabilized after receiving a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). 

The patient's current issues include anemia with a hematocrit level of 17-19% yesterday morning, now stable at around 27% after the transfusion. There is also a hematoma on his abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, but no intervention is required at this time. Hematocrit checks will be decreased to the hospital's transfusion service for levels below 24%. Coumadin will be restarted when approved by the surgery team.

Regarding the patient's atrial fibrillation (Afib), he did not respond to amiodarone 150 mg twice daily, diltiazem gastrointestinal tube (gtt), lopressor gtt, or verapamil gtt. He was eventually converted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) hours after receiving 2 mg of ibutilide"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who underwent open coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and pulmonary artery fistula repair on [4-23]. He was transferred to the ICU from the floor with an aflutter, hemodynamic stability, and fever. The patient is now back in sinus rhythm (SR) after receiving ibutilide on [4-25]. He has experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct), which has now stabilized at around 27% following a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal range. His platelet count (Plt) has been fluctuating but remains within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped significantly, indicating a possible anemia. The patient received a transfusion of PRBCs, which helped stabilize the Hct level. Close monitoring of Hct levels is necessary, and transfusion may be required if the Hct falls below 24.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient initially presented with an aflutter, which was unresponsive to multiple medications such as amiodarone, diltiazem, lopressor, and verapamil. Eventually, the patient was converted back to SR after receiving ibutil"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and open cholecystectomy (CCY), as well as hernia repair. He was transferred to the ICU from the floor with symptoms of rapid aflutter and a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) level. The patient is now back in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). 

The patient has experienced fevers that have since resolved, and his Hct level has stabilized after receiving a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct level was previously low but has now stabilized at around 27% for the past 48 hours after receiving the PRBC transfusion. The frequency of Hct checks has been decreased to once daily, and transfusion will be considered for Hct levels below 24%. The patient will also restart taking aspirin (asa) when it is deemed appropriate by the surgery team.

2. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient did not respond to amiodarone 150 mg twice daily, diltiazem gargle, Lopressor, or verapamil gargle. However, he was successfully converted back to NSR hours after receiving 2 mg of ibutilide on April 25th afternoon. The patient is currently on oral am"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension (HTN), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and recent surgery for CCY/umbilical hernia repair. The patient presented with his third episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR) but is now in sinus rhythm. He is currently on post-operative day 7.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/61 mmHg to 144/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and no murmurs or peripheral edema.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Kidney function is within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. Electrolytes are also within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium at 5.8 mEq/L. Blood glucose levels are elevated but being managed with insulin therapy.

The patient's anemia is being monitored closely due to a previous gastrointestinal bleed. The goal hematocrit (Hct) is set at 27%, and transfusion is considered if the Hct falls below"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AFib) who underwent open coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, conversion from laparoscopic to open procedure, and hernia repair on April 23rd. He was initially admitted to the floor and later transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (HD stable). The patient is now back in normal sinus rhythm (NSR).

Key Issues:
1. Anemia: The patient had a drop in hemoglobin concentration but has stabilized after receiving a blood transfusion.
2. AFib: The patient initially did not respond to amiodarone, diltiazem, lopressor, and verapamil but reverted to NSR hours after receiving 2 mg of ibutilide. He will continue taking oral amiodarone for one week and lopressor.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has resolved, with creatinine levels returning to baseline.
4. Fevers: The patient's fevers have resolved, but the source of infection remains unclear. There were concerns about a possible bile leak in the abdomen post-operation, as well as a hematoma that could have served as a site for infection. The patient's right hemidiaphragm was chronically elevated, causing compression of the right"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery, atrial fibrillation, and open coronary artery bypass grafting (CCY) surgery with conversion from laparoscopic to open procedure. He also had a hernia repair on April 23rd. The patient was transferred to the ICU from the floor with atrial flutter and hemodynamic stability. He is now back in normal sinus rhythm. The patient had fevers that are now resolved, and a drop in hematocrit level, which has stabilized after a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

24-hour events include ambulation and tolerance of oral intake. The patient's allergies are unknown. His last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Piperacillin, and Metronidazole on different dates.

Vital signs as of April 30th at 12:09 PM show a temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.5Â°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/58 mmHg to 144/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's weight is currently 118 kg and height is 71 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,610 mL and output of 2,550 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 940 mL. The patient is not on respiratory support, and his ABG results are unavailable.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. The cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. The respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds, and the abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. No muscle wasting or cyanosis is noted, and the patient is unable to stand.

Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, oriented to time, place, person, and situation, and able to follow simple commands. Movement, tone, and skin assessment are not performed.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 248 K/uL, platelet count of 200 K/uL, sodium of 138 mg/dL, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride of 101 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 28.5%, BUN of 26.2 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, glucose of 172 mg/dL, and albumin of 3.0 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include anemia that is stable, atrial fibrillation initially unresponsive to medication but now in normal sinus rhythm after administration of ibutil"
