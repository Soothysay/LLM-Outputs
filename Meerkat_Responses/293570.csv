","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. She presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and chest pain, which has since resolved. Her initial hematocrit level was 25.5, indicating significant blood loss. She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but her hematocrit continued to decrease, prompting the administration of a second unit of PRBCs. 

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, for which she has undergone a previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). She reports chronic chest pain that is unchanged and is currently on two anti-anginal medications. 

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and is currently not receiving oral hypoglycemic medications due to being NPO. She is also hypertensive and has a history of hyperlipidemia. 

The patient's current assessment indicates recurrent bloody stools, suggesting a lower gastrointestinal source of bleeding. Other possible causes include hemorrhoidal bleeding and angiodysplasia. Ischemic colitis has been ruled out by CT abdomen. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 148/48-192/123 mmHg, heart rate between 83-100 beats per minute, respiratory rate at 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

Her laboratory results show a decreased hemoglobin level of 7."

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Last Name] is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and chest pain (now resolved). She has received a total of four units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) over the past day. Her hematocrit (Hct) on arrival to the ICU is 25.5%, which is lower than this morning despite receiving one unit of RBCs. Recent colonoscopy showed no significant pathology except for hemorrhoids. The most probable differential diagnoses include diverticular bleeding, hemorrhoidal bleed, and angiodysplasia. Ischemic colitis has been ruled out by a CT scan of the abdomen. Another unit of RBCs has been written for today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent bleeding: The patient's recurrent bloody stool and low Hct indicate ongoing bleeding, which needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further blood loss.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was in the 80s and 90s on multiple occasions, indicating hypotension. This could be due to blood loss or medication effects. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids (total in = 1,439 mL and 4,018 mL), which may lead to fluid overload. Regular assessment of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diverticulosis, and hemorrhoids. He was admitted with bright red blood per rectal (BRBPR) and experienced re-bleeding, requiring a transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient underwent colonoscopy last night. He has allergies to aspirin, prior gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and muscle aches from Lipitor. He received infusions of furosemide, lorazepam, and pantoprazole.

24-hour events include the placement of a cordis catheter in the right internal jugular vein (RIJ) for access, maintaining hemodynamic stability overnight, and receiving various medications.

Vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/55 to 192/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,439 mL, output of 1,790 mL, with a negative balance of 351 mL. Urine output is 1,540 mL, and blood products transfused amount to 1,120 mL.

The patient's bloodwork reveals a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.7 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.6 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL, and platelet count of 186 K/uL. Troponin-T levels are below detection limits, and glucose levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is presumed to have lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). A colonoscopy will be performed to evaluate the bleed, with the most likely etiology being diverticulosis or hemorrhoids. The patient will be kept on critical care monitoring with a cordis catheter for access, and critical care will be followed up every 8 hours today and then spaced to every 12 hours. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will be administered orally daily, and the patient will be NPO (nothing by mouth) for now.

Other plans include following calcium every 12 hours due to the blood products transfused, holding antiplatelets, and holding anti-hypertensives in the setting of bleeding. FiO2 will be weaned to maintain SpO2 >92%, and insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control.

The patient's ICU care includes access through a cordis catheter and peripheral lines, full code status, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient will remain in"

   upper bleed less likely. Hematocrit on arrival to ICU is 25.5, which is
   somewhat lower than this morning despite the interval transfusion of 1
   units pRBCs. Recent colonoscopy [**2107**] with hemorrhoids no other
   significant pathology. Most probable ddx includes diverticular bleeding
   as well as a hemorrhoidal bleed. Also consider  angiodysplasia.
   Ischemic colitis ruled out by CT-A abdomen.  Got a total of four units
   yesterday; another one unit written for this morning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and chest pain that has since resolved. She was found to have a hematocrit level of 25.5 upon arrival to the ICU and received a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The most probable differential diagnoses include diverticular bleeding, hemorrhoidal bleed, and angiodysplasia. Ischemic colitis has been ruled out by CT angiography. The patient is currently on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) prophylaxis, and her antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications have been held. She is expected to undergo a colonoscopy today, after which she may be advanced to clear liquids if tolerated. The patient's other medical conditions include chronic angina, for which she is on two anti-anginal medications, and diabetes mellitus, for which she is on oral hypoglycemics and insulin. Her blood pressure is currently being managed with metoprolol and other anti-hypertensive medications. She is also being treated for hyperlipidemia with simvastatin and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a PPI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diverticular bleeding: This refers to bleeding from small pouches that can form in the"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 803] is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and chest pain (CP). The patient underwent a colonoscopy on 01/28, which showed no evidence of bleeding. Despite no further gross blood loss, the patient's hematocrit (Hct) continued to drop. The patient's CP resolved without intervention. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): Although the colonoscopy was negative for LGIB, the persistent Hct drop suggests ongoing blood loss. Therefore, the possibility of UGIB should be considered, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned to investigate this further.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as boots should be continued to prevent this complication.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although not mentioned in the progress note, it is important to monitor for signs of VAP in mechanically ventilated patients. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus and is receiving insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent hyperglycemia.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are within normal range, but close monitoring of renal function is important, especially considering the use of contrast media during imaging studies.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains stable but slightly elevated. Close monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure are essential to prevent hypotension and its associated complications.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for nosocomial infections due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures. Regular assessment of vital signs, wound healing, and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of infection.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. The actual situation may vary, and additional information may be necessary for a more comprehensive assessment."

   Microbiology: [**2109-1-25**] BCx x 1: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 803**] is a 76F with DM, CAD, and h/o GIB who presented with LGIB
   and CP (now resolved).
   # GIB: recurrent BRBPR seems more suggestive of a lower source. Brisk
   upper bleed less likely. Hematocrit on arrival to ICU is 25.5, which is
   somewhat lower than this morning despite the interval transfusion of 1
   units pRBCs. Recent colonoscopy [**2107**] with hemorrhoids no other
   significant pathology. Most probable ddx includes diverticular bleeding
   as well as a hemorrhoidal bleed. Also consider  angiodysplasia.
   Ischemic colitis ruled out by CT-A abdomen.  Got a total of four units
   yesterday; another one unit written for this morning.
   -- deferring tagged RBC scan given HD stable, slow Hct loss; likely to
   be a low yield test
   -- maintain active T&S
   -- trend HCT q6-8, transfuse to HCT 30 given coronary disease
   -- UGIB unlikely; was on protonix 40 iv bid o/n; will change to PO PPI
   QD
   -- colonoscopy planned for today; completed prep overnight
   -- NPO; will consider advancing to clears at lunch after colonoscopy;
   then further as tolerated
   -- hold Plavix, SC heparin, or NSAIDs (not on aspirin at BL)
   -- surgery not consulted yet
   # CP, h/o CABG. Pt reports chronic CP, unchanged, and is on 2
   anti-anginal medications.   Enies CP on transfer to the ICU.
   -- ruled out for MI with serial enzymes  on admission
   -- avoid nitroglycerin or Imdur for now given hypotension in the ED
   -- continue Ranolazine
   -- hold metoprolol other anti-hypertensives for now; SBP 150
s ok; can
   slowly add back
   -- hold plavix, not on any aspirin
   # DM: Hold oral hypoglycemics as pt NPO
   -- FS QID
   -- Humalog SS
   # HTN: on home metoprolol, hold Cozaar, Imdur, Triampterene/HCTZ
   -- hold all agents
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   -- continue Simvastatin
   # GERD: continue PPI, [**Hospital1 7**] IV for now
   # FEN
   --  NPO for now; can consider advancing in afternoon after scope
   -- replete lytes, check frequent Ca

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 803] is a 76-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and prior gastrointestinal bleeding who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and chest pain (CP). She has received a total of four units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) over the past day. Her hematocrit (Hct) on arrival to the ICU was 25.5, which is lower than this morning despite receiving one unit of PRBCs. Recent colonoscopy showed internal hemorrhoids but no evidence of bleeding or significant pathology in the colon. The most probable differential diagnoses include diverticular bleeding, hemorrhoidal bleed, and angiodysplasia. Ischemic colitis has been ruled out by a CT abdomen.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Maintain active tracking and surveillance. Trend Hct q6-8, transfuse to Hct 30 given coronary disease. Most probable ddx includes diverticular bleeding as well as a hemorrhoidal bleed. Also consider angiodysplasia.
2. Coronary artery disease: Continue Ranolazine. Hold metoprolol and other anti-hypertensives for now; SBP 150 is okay; can slowly add back. Hold Plavix, not on any aspirin.
3. Diabetes mellitus: Hold oral hypoglycemics as pt NPO. Use fasting blood sugar (FS) Q"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and gastrointestinal bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently being monitored closely. The patient underwent a colonoscopy yesterday, which did not reveal any active bleeding, but showed one diverticulum and internal hemorrhoids. His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) decreased overnight, indicating ongoing bleeding, and he received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion. The patient complains of chest pain in the morning. He has allergies to aspirin and Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), and a history of muscle aches associated with Lipitor use. The patient is also taking several other medications including furosemide, K/Mag, colace, ranolazine, simvastatin, RISS, and protonix. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the chest pain.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and gastrointestinal bleeding who was admitted to the ICU. He underwent a colonoscopy that did not reveal any active bleeding, but one diverticulum and internal hemorrhoids were visualized. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells due to a decrease in hemoglobin concentration from 29 to 23 overnight. He complains of chest pain in the morning. The patient has allergies to aspirin, a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, and muscle aches related to Lipitor (Atorvastatin Calcium). He is currently on several medications including furosemide, K/Mag, colace, ranolazine, simvastatin, RISS, and protonix. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/53 to 180/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is in sinus rhythm and has crackles bibasilar on respiratory examination. His abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. The patient's extremities are absent pulses in both the right and left sides. His neurologic examination is also normal.

Laboratory results show a decrease in hemoglobin concentration from 33.8% to 23.9% overnight, leukocyte count ranging from 10"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The source of bleeding was not clearly identified during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and the patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels have stabilized. The patient's main concerns include maintaining a hematocrit level above 30 due to his history of angina, holding clopidogrel for now, conducting serial HCT measurements, continuing pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitor), advancing the diet, and addressing potential complications related to his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Despite the negative colonoscopy, there is still a possibility of re-bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Close monitoring of HCT levels and serial assessments are necessary to detect any signs of ongoing or recurrent bleeding.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's history of CAD and the use of anticoagulants pose a risk for thrombosis. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and careful consideration of antiplatelet therapy are essential to prevent both thrombotic and bleeding events.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which can be attributed to blood loss and ongoing management in the ICU. Frequent monitoring of vital signs and appropriate hemodynamic support are crucial to maintain stable blood pressure levels.
4. Infection: P"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient had a negative colonoscopy, suggesting that the GIB is likely to be a low-grade source. His hematocrit (HCT) levels have been stable overnight. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including allergies to aspirin and prior episodes of GIB. He is currently taking medications such as Lipitor, pantoprazole, colace, ranolazine, simvastatin, and RISS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Despite a negative colonoscopy, there is still a possibility of ongoing or recurrent GIB. Close monitoring of HCT levels and vital signs is essential to detect any signs of re-bleeding.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of angina and is currently not on antiplatelet therapy due to the recent GIB. This puts him at an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures, such as the use of compression boots, should be continued.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 105/28 mmHg to 126/55 mmHg. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid management"
