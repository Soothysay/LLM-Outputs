   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute worsening of her mitral
   regurgiation.  Agree with admit note that differential for acute mitral
   regurgitation includes ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture.
   Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated
   wedge pressure, consistent with this finding.
   - Afterload reduction with nitroprusside (tried nitroglycerin, but did
   not work at max dose) for goal MAP < 80.  Will need to discuss on
   rounds tomorrow the use of nitroprusside in renal failure and need for
   monitoring for toxicity.
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis if her urine output doesn't improve with
   afterload reduction.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Cardiac surgery aware, formal consult in the am.
   - Consider TEE for further evaluation and follow up blood cultures to
   look for evidence of endocarditis.
   - If she were to decomensate, IABP could be considered as a temporary
   hemodynamic support.
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   Pt is now diuresing well after afterload reduction with nitroprusside.
   - Appreciate renal consult.
   - Will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - Per renal, will continue pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg
   IV q8h
   - Will add on tacroliums level tonight and send in the am.
   - NPO after midnight for possible biopsy
   - Per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - Will hold gabapentin for now.
   - Patient was somewhat hyperkalemic, EKG was without changes.  Repeat K
   somewhat lower.  Will give a dose of kayexelate and trend potassium.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - As above, will rule out for MI as a cause of worsening MR/heart
   failure.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - Holding plavix for now in case she requires surgery to treat her
   mitral regurgitation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - Check a vanc level in the am.
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  She had no clinical evidence of bleeding currently.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.  Hematocrit decreased to
   23 this morning.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend Hct.
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars not well-controlled since admission, running
   in the 300
   - consider increased in Lantus dose vs. insulin gtt
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who underwent a kidney transplant. She was admitted to the hospital for septic arthritis in her left ankle and developed acute renal failure. The patient also has a recent hospitalization for mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and acute diastolic heart failure. She presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and a transthoracic echocardiogram showing severe mitral regurgitation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 146/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on non-invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dyspnea: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute worsening of her mitral regurgitation. This could lead to further deterioration of cardiac function, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.
2. Acute Renal Failure/s/p Renal Transplant: The patient's creatinine level rose after an undetectable tacrolimus level was noted. This raises the possibility of acute rejection. There is also a concern for pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis due to poor forward"

   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and

   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgiation.  Agree with
   admit note that differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding.
   - Continue afterload reduction with nitroprusside for now; attempt to
   switch to another afterload reducer (such as hydralazine)
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis; will re-bolus now and then increase gtt rate
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Holding on CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   - TEE for further eval of valve
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   UOP still has not drastically increased.  Following renal recs:
   - will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - f/u ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - tacrolimus level
   - per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - will hold gabapentin for now.
   - trending K, as pt was hyperkalemic yesterday evening
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - can likely restart plavix, as pt likely not going to surgery
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally

   - f/u vanc level
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. The differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed pulmonary artery hypertension (PA htn) and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding.

The patient's current condition includes acute diastolic heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure post renal transplant, and recent septic arthritis of her left ankle. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation, PICC line, arterial line, PA catheter, and cordis/introducer. She is also receiving various medications including nitroprusside, furosemide, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and others."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # PUMP/Acute diastolic heart failure/Mitral regurgitation/Dsypnea:
   The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, has crackles on exam, and
   TTE shows new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
   Her presentation is consistent with acute worsening of her mitral
   regurgiation.  Differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture.
   - Afterload reduction with nitroprusside (tried nitroglycerin, but did
   not work at max dose) for goal MAP < 80.  Will need to discuss on
   rounds tomorrow the use of nitroprusside in renal failure and need for
   monitoring for toxicity.
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis if her urine output doesn't improve with
   afterload reduction.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Cardiac surgery aware, formal consult in the am.
   - Consider TEE for further evaluation and follow up blood cultures to
   look for evidence of endocarditis.
   - If she were to decomensate, IABP could be considered as a temporary
   hemodynamic support.
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   - Appreciate renal consult.
   - Will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - Per renal, will continue pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg
   IV q8h
   - Will add on tacroliums level tonight and send in the am.
   - NPO after midnight for possible biopsy
   - Per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - Will hold gabapentin for now.
   - Patient was somewhat hyperkalemic, EKG was without changes.  Repeat K
   somewhat lower.  Will give a dose of kayexelate and trend potassium.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - As above, will rule out for MI as a cause of worsening MR/heart
   failure.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - Holding plavix for now in case she requires surgery to treat her
   mitral regurgitation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - Check a vanc level in the am.
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  She had no clinical evidence of bleeding currently.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - Trend Hct.
   # Diabetes:
   - Continue Lantus 18 units qhs and SSI with qid fingerstick monitoring.
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # PUMP/Acute diastolic heart failure/Mitral regurgitation/Dsypnea:
   The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, has crackles on exam, and
   TTE shows new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
   Her presentation is consistent with acute worsening of her mitral
   regurgiation.  Differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture.
   - Afterload reduction with nitroprusside (tried nitroglycerin, but did
   not work at max dose) for goal MAP < 80.  Will need to discuss on
   rounds tomorrow the use of nitroprusside in renal failure and need for
   monitoring for toxicity.
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis if her urine output doesn't improve with
   afterload reduction.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Cardiac surgery aware, formal consult in the am.
   - Consider TEE for further evaluation and follow up blood cultures to
   look for evidence of endocarditis.
   - If she were to decomensate, IABP could be considered as a temporary
   hemodynamic support.
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   - Appreciate renal consult.
   - Will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - Per renal, will continue pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg
   IV q8h
   - Will add on tacroliums level tonight and send in the am.
   - NPO after midnight for possible biopsy
   - Per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - Will hold gabapentin for now.
   - Patient was somewhat hyperkalemic, EKG was without changes.  Repeat K
   somewhat lower.  Will give a dose of kayexelate and trend potassium.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - As above, will rule out for MI as a cause of worsening MR/heart
   failure.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - Holding plavix for now in case she requires surgery to treat her
   mitral regurgitation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - Check a vanc level in the am.
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  She had no clinical evidence of bleeding currently.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - Trend Hct.
   # Diabetes:
   - Continue Lantus 18 units qhs and SSI with qid fingerstick monitoring.
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis with acute renal failure. She presents with worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient's current medications include nitroprusside for afterload reduction, Lasix for diuresis, metoprolol on hold due to acute congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiac surgery consult in the morning, and consideration for transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and blood cultures to evaluate for endocarditis. If she were to decompensate, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) could be considered as temporary hemodynamic support.

Regarding her acute renal failure post renal transplant, her creatinine rose after an undetectable tacrolimus level was noted, making acute rejection a possibility. In the setting of acute heart failure, it is important to differentiate between prerenal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor forward flow/hypoperfusion. A renal consult has been appreciated, and further tests including urine electrolytes, urine osm"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] with metolazone, per renal recs, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TEE with bubble study to evaluate mitral valve and to evaluate for
   ASD
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   - can likely pull Swan this afternoon
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   - continue hyhdrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue tacrolimus 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.
   No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   yesterday, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgiation.  Agree with
   admit note that differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding.
   - Continue afterload reduction with nitroprusside for now; attempt to
   switch to another afterload reducer (such as hydralazine)
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis; will re-bolus now and then increase gtt rate
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Holding on CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   - TEE for further eval of valve
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   UOP still has not drastically increased.  Following renal recs:
   - will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - f/u ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - tacrolimus level
   - per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - will hold gabapentin for now.
   - trending K, as pt was hyperkalemic yesterday evening
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - can likely restart plavix, as pt likely not going to surgery
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - f/u vanc level
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 this morning. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - repeating Hct this afternoon
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars not well-controlled since admission, running
   in the 300
s. Likely related to stress dose steroids.
   - starting insulin gtt
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, chronic pain, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has been started on insulin gtt for glycemic control, given Lasix 80 mg IV for fluid balance, and had adjustments made to their renal medications. The patient's renal ultrasound showed normal findings with no perinephric fluid collection or hydronephrosis. 

Mixed venous saturation readings in the 90s suggest cyanide toxicity or intracardiac shunt. An echocardiogram has been ordered to evaluate for a shunt. 

The patient's blood sugars have been in the 120s with insulin gtt at 1 unit/hr. Insulin drip has been discontinued, and the patient is now receiving glargine and sliding scale insulin. The patient has advanced to a regular diet. 

The patient experienced a long run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) at around 5 a.m., and magnesium level was noted to be 1.8. Magnesium repletion was initiated despite the presence of renal failure. 

The patient has allergies to codeine, amoxicillin, and adhesive tape. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/41-151/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), decreased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.50, low carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and high oxygen (O2) saturation. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic assessments due to their current sedated state. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of diabetes mellitus type I, pain control, end-stage renal disease, and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient continues to receive ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and various prophylactic measures. 

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable with ongoing monitoring and management of their multiple medical conditions."

   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] with metolazone, per renal recs, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TEE with bubble study to evaluate mitral valve and to evaluate for
   ASD
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   - can likely pull Swan this afternoon
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.

   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.

   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.
   No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis. She presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and findings on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed pulmonary artery hypertension (PA htn) and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. The patient also had abnormally high mixed venous O2 sats, which could represent cyanide toxicity versus intracardiac shunt. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dyspnea: The patient's symptoms and findings on TTE indicate acute diastolic heart failure secondary to severe mitral regurgitation. She has been prescribed hydralazine for afterload reduction and Lasix 100 mg with metolazone for better diuresis. A CT consult for mitral valve replacement and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with bubble study have been ordered to evaluate the mitral valve and for an atrial septal defect (ASD). Intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) could be considered as temporary hemodynamic support if the patient decompensates. The Swan-Ganz catheter can be pulled this afternoon.

2. Acute Renal Failure/s/p Renal Transplant: The patient's creatinine levels have risen, making acute rejection a possibility. In the setting of acute heart failure, it is uncertain whether this represents pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor forward flow/hypoperfusion. The ultrasound of the transplanted kidney was normal. The patient is being continued on hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h, with follow-up of tacrolimus levels. Tacrolimus 4 mg will be continued, as well as bactrim prophylaxis. Gabapentin has been held, and electrolytes will be monitored. Diuretics will be continued as before.

3. Coronary Arteries: The patient has known CAD s/p CABG and PCI. There are no current chest pain or EKG changes. The patient will continue taking aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. Metoprolol has been held due to acute CHF exacerbation.

4. Rhythm: The patient is in sinus rhythm on EKG. Telemetry will be monitored.

5. Recent Septic Arthritis of Left Ankle: The patient's ID recommendations include stopping ceftazidime and continuing vancomycin. Pain control will be managed with hydromorphone. 

6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) on admission was 27.9 (baseline 25-27). It decreased to 23 yesterday and is now stable at 25. No obvious bleeding has been identified. The patient will continue taking ferrous sulfate, and a type and crossmatch will be performed. 

7. Diabetes: Blood sugars are better controlled at this time, likely due to stress dose steroids. The patient will continue her home regimen of insulin and will continue taking reglan for gastroparesis.

8. Depression: The patient will continue taking citalopram"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix gtt not achieving good diuresis; consider metolazone
 if still
   no diuresis, may need to consider CVVH to remove fluir
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - Consider CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TTE with bubble study to evaluate for shunt
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   - continue hyhdrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue tacrolimus 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.
   No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   yesterday, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis. She is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple ongoing medical issues.

The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. She also has abnormally high mixed venous O2 saturations, which could represent cyanide toxicity versus shunt.

Her creatinine levels have risen, making acute rejection of the renal transplant a possibility. The ultrasound of the transplanted kidney appears normal. She is receiving hydrocortisone 50 mg intravenously every 8 hours, and her tacrolimus level is being monitored.

The patient has known coronary artery disease, for which she is on aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. However, metoprolol is being held due to acute heart failure exacerbation.

Other issues include recent septic arthritis of the left ankle, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and depression. The patient's blood sugars are better controlled at this time, and she is off insulin drip."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgiation.  Agree with
   admit note that differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding.
   - Continue afterload reduction with nitroprusside for now; attempt to
   switch to another afterload reducer (such as hydralazine)
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis; will re-bolus now and then increase gtt rate
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Holding on CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   - TEE for further eval of valve
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   UOP still has not drastically increased.  Following renal recs:
   - will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - f/u ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - tacrolimus level
   - per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - will hold gabapentin for now.
   - trending K, as pt was hyperkalemic yesterday evening
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - can likely restart plavix, as pt likely not going to surgery
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - f/u vanc level
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 this morning. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - repeating Hct this afternoon
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars not well-controlled since admission, running
   in the 300
s. Likely related to stress dose steroids.
   - starting insulin gtt
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with a living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU with worsening dyspnea, new severe mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, acute diastolic heart failure, and elevated mixed venous saturation suggesting possible cyanide toxicity or intracardiac shunt. The patient's creatinine level rose after an undetectable tacrolimus level, making acute rejection of the renal transplant a possibility. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dyspnea: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgitation, which can be caused by ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. She is currently being managed with afterload reduction, diuresis, and evaluation for valve issues through transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).
2. Acute Renal Failure/s/p Renal Transplant: The patient's creatinine level rose due to an undetectable tacrolimus level, which may indicate acute rejection of the renal transplant. Other factors such as prerenal azotemia or acute tubular"

   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation; transition to PO

   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.

   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention, end-stage renal disease status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, all consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing pulmonary artery hypertension and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. The patient's creatinine rose after an undetectable tacrolimus level, making acute rejection a possibility. Ulytes more consistent with pre-renal azotemia. U/s of transplanted kidney WNL. Cr still rising. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation which may lead to further heart failure and pulmonary edema if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest possible acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis. It is important to monitor the patient's renal function and consider additional renal recommendations.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, renal failure (ESRD), and chronic heart failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU for further management of his conditions. Recent interventions include transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), placement of a pulmonary artery catheter (PA catheter), and adjustment of immunosuppressive medication (Prograf) due to elevated levels. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, with plans to decrease Prograf dosage and check daily trough tacrolimus levels. The patient's pain control is also a priority, with both acute and chronic pain addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of multiple lines (PICC line, arterial line, and Cordis/introducer) and prolonged ICU stay. Measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous UF heparin are in place to reduce the risk of complications.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is closely monitored, and there is a concern for fluid overload given his heart failure diagnosis. Aggressive diuresis and careful fluid management are necessary to prevent complications related to fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.

3. Bleeding: The patient's elevated Prograf level and the presence of an arterial line put him"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, renal failure (ESRD), and chronic heart failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include a transesophageal echo (TEE) and PA catheter insertion. The TEE revealed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient's prograf level was elevated at 13.8, leading to a decrease in the dose to 3mg. Over the weekend, daily trough tacro levels will be checked and communicated to the on-call renal fellow for adjustment. The patient received hydrocortisone 25 TID on Friday and Saturday, then changed to prednisone 10mg on Sunday (ordered).

The patient has allergies to codeine, amoxicillin, and adhesive tape. He has not received any antibiotics since admission. The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix) started on 04/04/2149 at 12:30 PM and hydralazine started on 04/04/2149 at 06:00 PM. Other medications include prograf, tacrolimus, and prednisone.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C (99%), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/67mmHg to 149/67mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 59.7 kg, and height is 67 inches.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 6 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 48/22 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation of 80%. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 644 mL and output of 720 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 76 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an ABG of ///22/. Physical examination reveals a new 4-5/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 21-25.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 483 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 2.7-3.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 98-110 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include diabetes mellitus type I, pain control, renal failure (ESRD), and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF). The patient's ICU care includes glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, prophylaxis for deep"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] with metolazone, per renal recs, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TEE with bubble study to evaluate mitral valve and to evaluate for
   ASD
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   - can likely pull Swan this afternoon
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   - continue hyhdrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue tacrolimus 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.
   No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   yesterday, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis with acute renal failure. She is currently in the ICU for acute diastolic heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation, and dyspnea. The patient's conditions include acute renal failure post renal transplant, known coronary artery disease, sinus rhythm, recent septic arthritis of the left ankle, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and depression. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute diastolic heart failure with severe mitral regurgitation can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
2. Acute renal failure post renal transplant can progress to chronic rejection or further deterioration of renal function.
3. Known coronary artery disease may result in recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
4. Recent septic arthritis of the left ankle could lead to further joint damage or infection spread.
5. Anemia may cause fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Diabetes mellitus requires careful management to prevent hyperglycemia and its associated complications.
7. Depression can worsen overall health outcomes if not addressed appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. This
   morning, patient has worsened systemic hypertension, increased SOB, and
   louder MR murmur.
   - restart IV hydralazine + nitro gtt for afterload reduction
   - consider nicardipine gtt
   - Lasix 120 mg IV with metolazone, followed by lasix gtt, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr still rising.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23; now stable. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Mitral Regurgitation: The patient's symptoms and TEE findings suggest acute mitral regurgitation. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA htn) and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with acute mitral regurgitation.
2. Acute Renal Failure/s/p Renal Transplant: The patient's creatinine level rose after an undetectable tacrolimus level was noted, making acute rejection a possibility. Additionally, the patient's urine electrolytes suggest pre-renal azotemia. An ultrasound of the transplanted kidney showed no abnormalities.

   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. This
   morning, patient has worsened systemic hypertension, increased SOB, and
   louder MR murmur.
   - restart IV hydralazine + nitro gtt for afterload reduction
   - consider nicardipine gtt
   - Lasix 120 mg IV with metolazone, followed by lasix gtt, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr still rising.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   6 week course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K
   ankle, daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15),
   weekly CBCs while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt
   abx
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23; now stable. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Acute Mitral Regurgitation: The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on exam, and a TTE showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. This indicates a potential cardiac complication that requires immediate attention.

2. Acute Renal Failure/Post-transplant: The patient's creatinine levels have risen after an undetectable tacrolimus level was noted, suggesting the possibility of acute rejection. Additionally, there is concern for pre-renal azotemia due to poor forward flow/hypoperfusion in the setting of acute heart failure. The patient's transplanted kidney ultrasound is negative for any abnormalities.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has known CAD with previous CABG and PCI procedures. There is a possibility of ischemia being the etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 27.9 to 23, indicating a decrease in red blood cell mass. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of anemia.

5. Diabetes Mellitus Type I: The patient's blood sugars were initially elevated, likely related to stress dose steroids. However, they are now better controlled.

6. Depression: The patient is on citalopram and bupropion for depression management.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Acute mitral regurgitation: The patient has worsening dyspnea, crackles on exam, and a TTE showing new severe mitral regurgitation. This can lead to heart failure and pulmonary edema if not managed properly.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is rising, indicating a possible acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from poor forward flow/hypoperfusion. The undetectable tacrolimus level suggests the possibility of acute rejection.

3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known CAD s/p CABG and PCI. Ischemia is a possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction leading to acute mitral regurgitation.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased from 27.9 to 23"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, chronic pain, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU for pain control and management of her chronic and acute pain. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure readings ranging from the 120s/50s to 170s/75 mmHg. Despite increasing the frequency of hydralazine and administering nifedipine, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. Nitro drip was increased to 4.0 mg/kg/min, which resulted in a decrease in blood pressure to the 140s. 

Renal recs were mentioned, and the patient required potassium repletions during the day. Lasix 120 mg IV was given, resulting in the output of 200-300 cc, and subsequently, Lasix gtt was started. The patient also had right upper extremity edema, but a wet read was negative. 

The patient has been on multiple medications, including furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 15 mg/hour, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and hydralazine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), heart rate of 108 bpm, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and blood pressure ranging from 137/57 to 172/75 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 94%, and the heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels at 460 K/uL, low hemoglobin at 8.0 g/dL, elevated creatinine at 4.1 mg/dL, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 64 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, liver function tests, electrolyte levels, and cardiac markers. 

The patient's fluid balance has been monitored, with a total intake of 1,524 mL and a total output of 2,557 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 94%. Physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, unassessed peripheral vascular status, and unassessed neurologic status. 

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided in the progress note, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's significantly elevated blood pressure readings indicate a potential hypertensive emergency, which can lead to organ damage if not promptly managed.

2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and BUN suggest worsening renal function, which can be exacerbated by the patient's ESRD. This may result in further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates a negative balance, suggesting fluid overload. This can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and worsening heart failure symptoms.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level requires close monitoring and management to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and other complications related to hyperkalemia.

5. Infection: The elevated white blood cell"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis with acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showing new severe MR and pulmonary hypertension. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed pulmonary arterial hypertension (PA htn) and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with acute MR. The patient is currently on intravenous (IV) hydralazine, nitroglycerin, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction. Due to the patient being hypertensive in the morning, it was decided to increase labetalol to 400 TID and attempt to wean nitro gtt if possible. Lasix gtt is being held as the patient is diuresing well this morning. Metoprolol is being held for now due to acute CHF. The possibility of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) as temporary hemodynamic support if decompensates is being considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. This
   morning, patient has worsened systemic hypertension, increased SOB, and
   louder MR murmur.
   - restart IV hydralazine + nitro gtt for afterload reduction
   - consider nicardipine gtt
   - Lasix 120 mg IV with metolazone, followed by lasix gtt, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr still rising.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   6 week course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K
   ankle, daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15),
   weekly CBCs while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt
   abx
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23; now stable. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history including diabetes mellitus type I, renal failure (end stage renal disease), heart failure (diastolic, acute on chronic), and alterations in nutrition. 

The patient was started on standing nifedipine 60 CR, labetolol 100mg, and nitro due to cardiovascular issues. The patient's blood pressure crept up, so the labetolol dose was uptitrated to 200 TID, and metolazone 10 mg was given. Diuresis of 200 cc/hr was initiated. 

The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, with serial creatinine levels showing improvement. A renal biopsy has been held off, and the patient's immunosuppressive medication (tacro level 5.9) is being adjusted accordingly. 

The patient has multiple allergies, including codeine, amoxicillin, and adhesive tape. 

Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/60 mmHg to 87/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on sinus rhythm with respiratory support via a nasal cannula. 

The patient's weight has decreased from 58.8 kg at admission to 55.7 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a net loss of 3,119 mL over the past 24 hours. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values, such as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal range. 

The patient has multiple imaging studies ordered, including ankle films and a three-view of the ankle to assess for potential infection or complications related to previous orthopedic interventions. 

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, renal failure, heart failure, and nutrition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The summary of the patient's health progress includes:

- The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting related to codeine and amoxicillin.
- They have unknown allergies to blood-group specific substances and adhesive tape.
- The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, hydralazine, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/46 mmHg to 159/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient's weight has decreased from 58.8 kg at admission to 55.7 kg currently.
- Fluid balance shows an input of 1,546 mL (including 355 mL of total parenteral nutrition), output of 4,665 mL (including 2,130 mL of urine), resulting in a negative balance of 3,119 mL.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 96% and ABG results indicating a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, and HCO3- of 86 mEq/L.
- Physical examination findings are incomplete, with assessments not conducted for peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and others.
- Laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium (438 K/uL), creatinine (4.1 mg/dL), urea nitrogen (53 mg/dL), and glucose (233 mg/dL). The WBC count is within normal range, but Hct and Plt levels are slightly below normal. Other lab values indicate various abnormalities.
- The patient has a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I, renal failure (ESRD), heart failure (acute on chronic), and pain control.
- The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin, and prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention and stress ulcer management.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of indwelling lines (PICC line and arterial line), which can serve as potential entry points for pathogens.
2. Fluid overload: The negative fluid balance suggests that the patient may be experiencing fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's frequent administration of insulin and high glucose levels indicate a risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dosage is not carefully adjusted.
4. Renal function deterioration: The elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen levels suggest worsening renal function, which may require further interventions to manage.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart failure exacerbation and abnormal blood pressure readings may increase the risk of arrhythmias or cardiac events.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's health progress, and additional information may be required to assess potential medical complications more accurately."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. Pt currently
   on IV hydral, nitro gtt, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload
   reduction.  Noted to be more hypertensive this AM than has been.
   - continue hydral, nifedipine; increase labetalol to 400 TID
   - attempt to wean nitro gtt if possible
   - holding lasix gtt as pt is diuresing well this morning; will recheck
   I/O this PM
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr improving today.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:  Per ortho recs, 6 week
   course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K ankle,
   daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15), weekly CBCs
   while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt abx
   - continue vanco; redosing this morning as level is 12
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recent baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit stable. No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - continue to trend Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention, end-stage renal disease status post living-related kidney transplant, recent hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on exam, and transesophageal echocardiogram showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed pulmonary artery hypertension and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. The patient is currently on intravenous hydralazine, nitroglycerin, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction. She has been more hypertensive this morning than previously.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Lastname] is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis with acute renal failure.

The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed pulmonary artery hypertension and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. Nitro drip was discontinued, and the patient is currently on intravenous (IV) hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction.

The patient's creatinine level rose after an undetectable tacrolimus level, making acute rejection a possibility. The patient is being closely monitored, and prograf is being dosed based on renal function. Bactrim prophylaxis is also being continued.

The patient has known coronary artery disease and is on aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin. Metoprolol is being held due to acute congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's recent septic arthritis of the left ankle is being treated with a 6-week"

","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant. She presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on exam, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, which are consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. The patient has been diagnosed with acute diastolic heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension.

She is currently being treated with intravenous (IV) hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction. The patient's creatinine level rose after her tacrolimus level became undetectable, making acute rejection a possibility. Additionally, she has acute renal failure, and there is a concern for pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor forward flow/hypoperfusion. The patient's transplanted kidney ultrasound is normal, and her creatinine is improving today.

The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG and PCI. No current chest pain or EKG changes are present, but ischemia is a possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction. She is on aspirin, clopidogrel, and at"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-inch, 53 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hyperglycemia.
- The patient's 24-hour events include an increase in tacrolimus dosage, change in Lasix administration from gtt to IV bolus with metolazone, discontinuation of nitro drip, titration of labetalol and nifedipine to control blood pressure, and administration of vancomycin due to a low level.
- Ankle films showed postoperative changes, persistent destruction of medial malleolus fracture with adjacent cortical irregularity, and a subtle increase in density at the posterior aspect of the calcaneus, which raises the possibility of an insufficiency fracture.
- The patient has allergies to codeine, amoxicillin, and adhesive tape.
- The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin given on [2149-4-8] at 11:15 AM.
- Infusions include heparin sodium for prophylaxis and hydralazine.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease. She has undergone a living-related kidney transplant and was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis in her left ankle. The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and findings consistent with acute mitral regurgitation on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). She also has pulmonary hypertension and elevated wedge pressure.

The patient's current medications include tacrolimus, lasix IV bolus, hydralazine, nifedipine, labetalol, metoprolol (held due to acute congestive heart failure), gabapentin (held), prednisone, bactrim prophylaxis, ASA, Plavix, and atorvastatin.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, glucose, and lactic acid. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated. Her creatinine level has improved from 4.1 to 3.4. The urinalysis shows 25.9% proteinuria.

The patient's assessment and plan include constipation, alteration in nutrition, diabetes mellitus type 1, pain control, renal failure, and heart failure. The physician's recommendations include uptitrating labetalol for afterload reduction, continuing IV hydralazine, nifedipine, and IV"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post living-related kidney transplant, recent hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on exam, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed pulmonary artery hypertension and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. The patient was initially on nitro drip, which has been discontinued, as well as lasix gtt. The patient is currently on PO hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction. 

The patient also has acute renal failure/s/p renal transplant, with improvement in creatinine levels from 4.1 to 1.9. Kidney ultrasound was unremarkable. Prograf level is currently at 4 mg, and the patient is on Bactrim prophylaxis. Prednisone is being continued at 10 mg daily, and further taper will be held off until t"

She presented with worsening dyspnea, crackles on exam, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing new severe MR and pulmonary hypertension, consistent with acute MR. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed pulmonary artery (PA) hypertension and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. She was initially on nitro drip which has been discontinued as has Lasix gtt. The patient is currently on PO hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction. Her current medications include prograf, Bactrim prophylaxis, and prednisone at 10 mg daily. She also has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG and PCI, and no current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction. She is in sinus rhythm on telemetry. She will need 6-week course of vancomycin from the day of explant. She will need to monitor weekly CBC/diff, BUN, Cr, LFTs, vancomycin trough while on vancomycin. The patient's Hct is stable, and iron studies are consistent with deficiency. She has labile blood sugars in the setting of gastroparesis, inconsistent PO intake.
