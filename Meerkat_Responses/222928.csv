   Assessment and Plan
   81M with history of coronary artery disease and depressed EF,
   presenting after respiratory failure, found to have EF of 10% with
   3+MR.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret  with RBBB though
   anterior ST changes are suspcious.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Will start carvedilol
   # PUMP:  Severely depressed EF of 10%.  At this point, currently on
   norepi which is not optimal choice for patient with questionable
   cardiogenic shock.  His severe MR may be worsened with his current
   dilated LV.  At this point, his CXR does not show significant
   congestion (though he is vented) and his saturations are 98% on FiO2 of
   0.4.  Weaned off levo, BPs appropriate.
   - Weaning lasix
   - Will start beta-blocker as tolerated, then ACEI
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation at transfer.  Unclear if he has been in
   this rhythm in the past.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented as in above PE on arrival to CCU.  No
   signs of infection.  Wound consult.
   - f/u wound recs.
   # PULM:  Respiratory failure likely due to CHF though was treated for
   PNA at OSH.  CXR a large heart with prominent right hilum but no
   obvious infiltrate.  [**Last Name (LF) 1093**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] try to extubate today.
   - consider d/c pip-tazo
   # ANEMIA:  HCT low but stable.  Drop noted at the OSH.  Baseline is
   unclear though most likely in the low 30s.
   Fe studies consistent w/ combination of Fe difficiency and ACD.
   - Transfuse if drops further; not clearly ischemic so holding on
   transfusion for >30.
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently 2.3 after diuresis,
   stable.  Weaning down lasix drip today.
   -          Will be careful if adding ACEI

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), presenting after respiratory failure. He has severe mitral regurgitation (MR), an EF of 10%, and is currently on norepinephrine. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/48 to 146/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal range.

Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a known history of coronary artery disease, which may have contributed to his current condition.
2. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF): The patient's EF is severely depressed at 10%, indicating poor heart function.
3. Mitral regurgitation (MR): The patient has severe MR, which can lead to further deterioration of heart function and potentially result in heart failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure, which may have been caused by congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia.
5. Ulcer: The patient has a stage II ulcer with blisters and additional ulcerated areas, which may be due to pressure or a compromised immune system.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which requires rate control and anticoagulation.
7. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) on chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an elevated serum creatinine level.
8. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit (HCT) level, likely due to chronic disease and iron deficiency.
9. Possible in-stent restenosis: The patient's recent coronary angiography showed restenosis of a stent in the saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery.

Please note that this is a summary and potential complications based on the provided information. A comprehensive assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction (EF).
- He presented after respiratory failure and was found to have an EF of 10% with 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR).
- The patient has known three-vessel disease with in-stent restenosis of a saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery.
- His electrocardiogram (ECG) is difficult to interpret but shows anterior ST changes.
- The patient is currently on norepinephrine, which is not the optimal choice for a patient with questionable cardiogenic shock.
- His severe MR may worsen his current dilated left ventricle.
- His chest X-ray (CXR) does not show significant congestion, and he has good oxygen saturation on FiO2 of 0.4.
- The plan is to wean off levo and down on Lasix as no longer needs significant diuresis.
- If there is pressure to work in the morning, low-dose ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker may be added as tolerated.
- The patient is in atrial fibrillation at transfer, and it is unclear if he has been in this rhythm before. Currently, rate-controlled.
- Beta-blocker may be added, along with heparin IV overnight.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
    81M with history of coronary artery disease and depressed EF,
   presenting after respiratory failure, found to have EF of 10% with
   3+MR.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret  with RBBB though
   anterior ST changes are suspcious.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Attept to add beta-blocker if able to come off pressors though
   currently with decompensated CHF
   # PUMP:  Severely depressed EF of 10%.  At this point, currently on
   norepi which is not optimal choice for patient with questionable
   cardiogenic shock.  His severe MR may be worsened with his current
   dilated LV.  At this point, his CXR does not show significant
   congestion (though he is vented) and his saturations are 98% on FiO2 of
   0.4.
   - Wean off levo
   - Wean down on lasix as no longer needs to be significantly diuresed
   - If has pressure to work with in AM, would favor adding low-dose ACEI,
   then beta-blocker as tolerated
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation at transfer.  Unclear if he has been in
   this rhythm in the past.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV overnight
   # PULM:  Respiratory failure likely due to CHF though was treated for
   PNA at OSH.  CXR a large heart with prominent right hilum but no
   obvious infiltrate.
   - Continue with pip-tazo and azithro though may be able to d/c
   # ANEMIA:  HCT noted to have dropped at the OSH.  Baseline is unclear
   though most likely in the low 30s.
   - Check iron studies
   - Transfuse if drops further; not clearly ischemic so holding on
   transfusion for >30.
   # RENAL FAILURE:  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD with baseline
   SCr in the high 1s.  Currently 2.3 after diuresis.
   - Wean down on lasix
   - Will be careful if adding ACEI

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), presenting after respiratory failure. He has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and an EF of 10%. The patient's ECG shows atrial fibrillation, and his physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur at the apex and diminished pulses in both lower extremities. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 109/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, troponin T, lactate, and lactic acid levels. Electrolyte levels show normal sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory system compliance of 60 cmH2O/mL, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Coronary artery disease: Known 3VD with recent in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery. Continue with aspirin and Plavix. Attempt to add beta-blocker if able to"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall individual with an altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, fever, anemia, acute respiratory failure, acute-on-chronic heart failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation, multi lumen access, and various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, midazolam, and fentanyl.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the presence of a foreign body (endotracheal tube) in the respiratory tract.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.

3. Nosocomial infections: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing nosocomial infections, particularly in the areas where the skin integrity is compromised.

4. Heart failure exacerbation: Given the patient's history of chronic heart failure, the acute exacerbation may lead to worsening of cardiac function and potentially life-threatening complications.

5. Medication-related adverse effects: The use of multiple medications, including vasopressors and sedatives, carries the risk of medication-related adverse effects, such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
    81M with history of coronary artery disease and depressed EF,
   presenting after respiratory failure, found to have EF of 10% with
   3+MR.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret  with RBBB though
   anterior ST changes are suspcious.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Attept to add beta-blocker if able to come off pressors though
   currently with decompensated CHF
   # PUMP:  Severely depressed EF of 10%.  At this point, currently on
   norepi which is not optimal choice for patient with questionable
   cardiogenic shock.  His severe MR may be worsened with his current
   dilated LV.  At this point, his CXR does not show significant
   congestion (though he is vented) and his saturations are 98% on FiO2 of
   0.4.
   - Wean off levo
   - Wean down on lasix as no longer needs to be significantly diuresed
   - If has pressure to work with in AM, would favor adding low-dose ACEI,
   then beta-blocker as tolerated
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation at transfer.  Unclear if he has been in
   this rhythm in the past.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV overnight
   # PULM:  Respiratory failure likely due to CHF though was treated for
   PNA at OSH.  CXR a large heart with prominent right hilum but no
   obvious infiltrate.
   - Continue with pip-tazo and azithro though may be able to d/c
   # ANEMIA:  HCT noted to have dropped at the OSH.  Baseline is unclear
   though most likely in the low 30s.
   - Check iron studies
   - Transfuse if drops further; not clearly ischemic so holding on
   transfusion for >30.
   # RENAL FAILURE:  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD with baseline
   SCr in the high 1s.  Currently 2.3 after diuresis.
   - Wean down on lasix
   - Will be careful if adding ACEI

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). He presented after respiratory failure and was found to have an EF of 10% with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient has known three-vessel disease and most recent catheterization showed in-stent restenosis of saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal (OM). The ECG is difficult to interpret, but there are anterior ST changes suspicious for ischemia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, beta-blocker, norepinephrine, levo, furosemide (Lasix), heparin, midazolam (Versed), and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 109/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2 of 325 mmHg, HCO3 of 21 mEq/L, and BE of -1. The patient's blood gases are within normal limits.

   6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient became more hypoxic throughout the day making
   copious amounts of secretions, by evening his RR increased to the 30's
   and he was sating in the mid 80's.  His ABG showed 7.44/32/74/22 on
   100% shuvel mask.  He was given 40 mg IV lasix x1 and 2 mg of
   morphine.  His CXR showed increased opacity near the right cardiac
   border concerning for PNA.  He was also given nebs without
   improvement.  He was reintubated without complication.  Patient started
   on vanco given possible PNA and hypoxia.  He will need ID approval for

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction. He presented after experiencing respiratory failure and was found to have an ejection fraction of 10% with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 

The patient's 24-hour events include the removal of an OSH subclavian line with some oozing at the site, stopping the lasix drip, starting carvedilol, extubation during rounds, stopping antibiotics, and experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He became more hypoxic throughout the day, making copious amounts of secretions, and his respiratory rate increased to the 30s. An arterial blood gas showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 32, PaO2 74, HCO3- 22 on 100% Shaw mask. 

The patient was given 40 mg IV lasix once and 2 mg of morphine. A chest X-ray showed increased opacity near the right cardiac border, concerning for possible pneumonia. Nebulizers were administered without improvement, and the patient was reintubated without complication. He was started on vancomycin for possible pneumonia and hypoxia, and will need ID approval for pip-tazo and vancomycin in the morning. The patient's digoxin level returned at 1.3.

   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's OSH subclavian line was pulled.  He had some oozing from
   the site.  The lasix drip was stopped and carvedilol was started.  The
   patient was extubated during rounds and his antibiotics were stopped.
   Earlier in the day the patient began having afib with RVR in the
   120's.  He was given 2.5 mg of lopressor x1 and his carvedilol was to
   6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient became more hypoxic throughout the day making
   copious amounts of secretions, by evening his RR increased to the 30's
   and he was sating in the mid 80's.  His ABG showed 7.44/32/74/22 on

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) presenting after respiratory failure. The patient has severe mitral regurgitation and an EF of 10%. The patient experienced several medical events throughout the day, including oozing from the site of a subclavian line removal, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypoxia, increased respiratory rate, reintubation, and possible pneumonia. The patient was started on various medications including carvedilol, lasix, and vancomycin. The patient's labs showed elevated white blood cell count and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severely depressed EF of 10% indicates a high risk for cardiogenic shock. The presence of severe mitral regurgitation may worsen the patient's condition.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's symptoms, such as increased opacity near the right cardiac border on chest X-ray and hypoxia, suggest a possible pneumonia. The patient has already been started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected PNA.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. A transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has been ordered.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline serum creat"

   Cardiomegaly
   is stable.
   Bibasilar alveolar opacity persists but decreased. Interstitial edema
   improved. There is no other change.
   Assessment and Plan
   81M with history of coronary artery disease and depressed EF,
   presenting after respiratory failure, found to have EF of 10% with
   3+MR.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret with RBBB though
   anterior ST changes are suspicious.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Continue  Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Cath this afternoon
   # PUMP:  Severely depressed EF of 10%.  His severe MR may be worsened
   with his current dilated LV.  At this point, his CXR does not show
   significant congestion (though he is vented) and his saturations are
   96-98% on FiO2 of 0.4.  BPs appropriate.  Required lasix gtt incrase to
   12mg/hr to obtain U/O > 100cc.
   - As the patient appears volume overloaded and required reintubation, a
   lasix gtt will be continued, in addition was restarted at 5 mg/hr
   - Continue [**Last Name (LF) 2629**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] restart ACEI as tolerated after catheterization.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation at transfer, continues to be in afib.
   Unclear if he has been in this rhythm in the past.  Currently rate
   controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV  gtt
   - Patient will likely require coumadin as OP.
   # PULM:  Respiratory failure likely due to CHF though was treated for
   PNA at OSH.  CXR a large heart with prominent right hilum but no
   obvious infiltrate on admission, b/l infiltrates on [**12-11**], and
   eventually improved on CXR today.   The patient was extubated in the am
   2d ago, however became hypoxic by night and was reintubated.   As CXR
   suggestive of  PNA on [**12-11**], pt was started on vanc and pip-tazo.
   Persistent infiltrates  remain.  PNA less likely, but will continue ABx
   until successful extubation.    RSBI was 56.
   - Continue vanc and pip-tazo for likely PNA for now.
   - Continue on the ventilator for now until complete
s cath, will do
   another rsbi tomorrow and attempt extubation.
   - Vanco trough at noon.
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented on arrival to CCU.  No signs of
   infection.  Wound consult.
   - Turn Q2H for now, if wound opens up will consider dressings.
   # ANEMIA:  HCT low but stable, 25.8, did not respond appropriately to
   one unit.  Drop noted at the OSH initially..  Baseline is unclear
   though most likely in the low 30s.  Fe studies consistent w/
   combination of Fe difficiency and ACD.
   - Will give another unit PRBC today and recheck a post transfusion Hct.
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently stable at 2.2.  FEURea
   12%, strongly suggestive of pre-renal, likely due to aggressive
   diuresis.  Most likely the baseline is higher than Cr of 1 as pt
   continues to be slightly volume up.  Will monitor for ATN.
   -          Will be careful if adding ACEI
   -          Will monitor Cr

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF).
- He presented with respiratory failure and was found to have an EF of 10% with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).
- The patient has known three-vessel disease with recent in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery.
- His current medications include aspirin, Plavix, and Metoprolol.
- The patient underwent reintubation due to respiratory failure and persistent hypoxia.
- He received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but did not show an appropriate response in hematocrit (HCT) levels.
- The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a baseline serum creatinine (Cr) level in the high 1s and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 12%, suggesting pre-renal azotemia due to aggressive diuresis.
- He has a stage II ulcer with blistering and is being consulted for wound care.
- The patient has persistent infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR), which initially suggested pneumonia but is now less likely.
- He is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected"

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction, presenting with respiratory failure. He was found to have an ejection fraction of 10% with 3+ mitral regurgitation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed in-stent restenosis of a saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery. He was started on metoprolol and lasix.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.1°C (100.5°F)
- Heart rate: 81 bpm (with a range of 67-86 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 115/44 mmHg (with a range of 96/35-129/52 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (with a range of 9-18 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's physical examination revealed a holosystolic murmur at the apex, and he has a purpuric lesion with a stage II ulcer. The patient is unresponsive to voice and intubated.

Laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 23000/uL (with a range of 23000-24000/uL)
- Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL (with a range of 8.8-9.2 g/d"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with history of coronary artery disease and depressed EF,
   presenting after respiratory failure, found to have EF of 10% with
   3+MR.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret with RBBB though
   anterior ST changes are suspicious.  Carvedilol stopped this am.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Started Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # PUMP:  Severely depressed EF of 10%.  At this point, currently on
   norepi which is not optimal choice for patient with questionable
   cardiogenic shock.  His severe MR may be worsened with his current
   dilated LV.  At this point, his CXR does not show significant
   congestion (though he is vented) and his saturations are 98% on FiO2 of
   0.4.  Weaned off levo, BPs appropriate.
   - As the patient appears volume overloaded and required reintubation, a
   lasix gtt was restarted at 5 mg/hr
   - Will start beta-blocker as tolerated, then ACEI
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation at transfer.  Unclear if he has been in
   this rhythm in the past.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV
   # PULM:  Respiratory failure likely due to CHF though was treated for
   PNA at OSH.  CXR a large heart with prominent right hilum but no
   obvious infiltrate.  The patient was extubated in the am yesterday,
   however became hypoxic by night and was reintubated.  CXR was
   concerning for developing PNA.  Patient was started on vanc and
   pip-tazo.
   - Continue vanc and pip-tazo for likely PNA
   - Continue on the ventilator for now.
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented on arrival to CCU.  No signs of
   infection.  Wound consult.
   - f/u wound recs.
   # ANEMIA:  HCT low but stable, this am it decreased to 22, but on
   recheck was 25.8.  Drop noted at the OSH.  Baseline is unclear though
   most likely in the low 30s.  Fe studies consistent w/ combination of Fe
   difficiency and ACD.
   - Will give 1 unit PRBC today and recheck a post transfusion Hct.
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently stable at 2.3.
   -          Will be careful if adding ACEI
   -          Will monitor Cr
   -          Urine lytes

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. He presented with respiratory failure and was found to have severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and in-stent restenosis of a saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery. The patient's condition has been complicated by atrial fibrillation, renal failure, anemia, and possible pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving various medications including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's severely depressed EF of 10%, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock due to impaired pumping function of the heart.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows a large heart with prominent right hilum, which is concerning for developing pneumonia. His reintubation and current ventilator support increase the risk of pneumonia.
3. Wound Infection: The presence of a stage II ulcer with blisters raises the concern for wound infection. Regular monitoring and wound care are essential.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level indicates chronic kidney disease (CKD), and his current creatinine level is stable at 2.3. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
5. Anemia: The patient's HCT is low"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). He presented with respiratory failure and was found to have an EF of 10% with 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient also has a history of in-stent restenosis of saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery.

The patient's current medical conditions include severely depressed left ventricular function (EF of 10%), atrial fibrillation, anemia, renal failure, and a stage II ulcer. He was initially treated for possible pneumonia (PNA) but now it is less likely. He remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of heart failure symptoms, development of further cardiac arrhythmias, progression of the stage II ulcer, worsening of renal function, and potential infections due to prolonged intubation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and daily weight changes to assess for signs of fluid overload or worsening heart failure. The use of diuretics such as Lasix will be continued to manage fluid balance and prevent pulmonary edema.

Additionally, the patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and the dosage of ACE inhibitors should be adjusted accordingly to avoid further deterioration of renal function. The patient's anemia should be addressed with appropriate blood product transfusions and"

   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret with RBBB though
   anterior ST changes are suspicious.   Repeat cath again showing 3VD, no
   intervention.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Continue  Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Cath this afternoon
   - Restart heparin gtt.
   # PUMP:  Severely depressed EF of 10%, ICD in place.  His severe MR may
   be worsened with his current dilated LV.  At this point, his CXR does
   not show significant congestion (though he is vented) and his
   saturations are 96-98% on FiO2 of 0.4.  BPs appropriate.  Required
   lasix gtt increase to 12mg/hr to obtain U/O > 100cc.  Per cath
   yesterday, LVEDP
 25, Wedge of 19 and RVEDP of 9mmHg.  CI 3.7.
   Patient appears euvolemic on exam, but still has elevated JVP.
   - Will continue lasix gtt with goal of -1Liter for today prior to
   extubation.
   - Continue [**Last Name (LF) 2629**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] restart ACEI as tolerated in afternoon, once
   diuresis is complete.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation at transfer, continues to be in afib.
   Unclear if he has been in this rhythm in the past.  Currently rate
   controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV  gtt
   - Patient will likely require coumadin as OP.
   # PULM:  Respiratory failure likely due to CHF though was treated for
   PNA at OSH.  Pt. completed VAnco/zosyn since [**12-10**], no signs of
   pulmonary infection on exam, radiographically or labs.   RSBI not done
   yet.
   - D/C vanc and pip-tazo.
   - Will attempt extubation trial today pending RISBI score.
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented on arrival to CCU.  No signs of
   infection.  Wound consult.
   - Turn Q2H for now, if wound opens up will consider dressings.
   # ANEMIA:  Pt responded to 2^nd unit appropriately.  HCT cont to be low
   but stable, 26.5.  Drop noted at the OSH initially..  Baseline is
   unclear though most likely in the low 30s.  Fe studies consistent w/
   combination of Fe difficiency and ACD.
   -          Will consider another unit PRBC in AM HCT continues to drop
   -          Check Haptoglobin today, although no signs of hemolysis
   clinically.
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently stable at 2.2.  FEURea
   12%, strongly suggestive of pre-renal, likely due to aggressive
   diuresis.  Most likely the baseline is higher than Cr of 1 as pt
   continues to be slightly volume up.  Will monitor for ATN.
   -          Will be careful if adding ACEI
   -          Will monitor Cr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. He presented with respiratory failure and was found to have an EF of 10% with 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including catheterization, intubation, administration of various medications, and blood transfusions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
- Heart rate: 74 bpm (64-102)
- Blood pressure: 98/40 mmHg (58) or 96/36 mmHg (54-71)
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (6-23)
- Oxygen saturation: 97%
- Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation (AF)

The patient's physical examination revealed a stage II ulcer on his right buttock with below-blister and additional ulcerated blisters in the periphery. There are also signs of edema and purpuric lesions.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactic acid. The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is low, indicating anemia. Other lab values such as white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (Plt), and electrolytes are within normal ranges."

   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret with RBBB though
   anterior ST changes are suspicious.   Repeat cath again showing 3VD, no
   intervention.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Continue  Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Cath this afternoon
   - Restart heparin gtt.
   # PUMP:  Severely depressed EF of 10%, ICD in place.  His severe MR may
   be worsened with his current dilated LV.  At this point, his CXR does
   not show significant congestion (though he is vented) and his
   saturations are 96-98% on FiO2 of 0.4.  BPs appropriate.  Required
   lasix gtt increase to 12mg/hr to obtain U/O > 100cc.  Per cath
   yesterday, LVEDP
 25, Wedge of 19 and RVEDP of 9mmHg.  CI 3.7.
   Patient appears euvolemic on exam, but still has elevated JVP.
   - Will continue lasix gtt with goal of -1Liter for today prior to
   extubation.
   - Continue [**Last Name (LF) 2629**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] restart ACEI as tolerated in afternoon, once
   diuresis is complete.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation at transfer, continues to be in afib.
   Unclear if he has been in this rhythm in the past.  Currently rate
   controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV  gtt
   - Patient will likely require coumadin as OP.
   # PULM:  Respiratory failure likely due to CHF though was treated for
   PNA at OSH.  Pt. completed VAnco/zosyn since [**12-10**], no signs of
   pulmonary infection on exam, radiographically or labs.   RSBI not done
   yet.
   - D/C vanc and pip-tazo.
   - Will attempt extubation trial today pending RISBI score.
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented on arrival to CCU.  No signs of
   infection.  Wound consult.
   - Turn Q2H for now, if wound opens up will consider dressings.
   # ANEMIA:  Pt responded to 2^nd unit appropriately.  HCT cont to be low
   but stable, 26.5.  Drop noted at the OSH initially..  Baseline is
   unclear though most likely in the low 30s.  Fe studies consistent w/
   combination of Fe difficiency and ACD.
   -          Will consider another unit PRBC in AM HCT continues to drop
   -          Check Haptoglobin today, although no signs of hemolysis
   clinically.
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently stable at 2.2.  FEURea
   12%, strongly suggestive of pre-renal, likely due to aggressive
   diuresis.  Most likely the baseline is higher than Cr of 1 as pt
   continues to be slightly volume up.  Will monitor for ATN.
   -          Will be careful if adding ACEI
   -          Will monitor Cr

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction (EF), presenting after respiratory failure. He was found to have an EF of 10% with 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient has undergone several interventions, including intubation, administration of antibiotics, diuretics, and blood transfusions.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 134/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. Electrolyte imbalances are also noted, including low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals a stage II ulcer with a below-blister and additional ulcerated blister in the periphery. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a holosystolic murmur at the apex, and his neurologic examination is unremarkable due to sed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction (EF), presenting with respiratory failure. He has been intubated and sedated. His temperature spiked to 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to the initiation of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) continues to fall, and he is being monitored for anemia. Tube feeds have been started, and there are plans for a trial extubation tomorrow morning. The patient is also receiving diuretics (Lasix) for fluid management and anticholinergic medication (Scopolamine) for copious secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The recent spike in temperature and presence of GNRs in sputum cultures suggest a possible infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility due to being intubated and bedridden increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Prophylactic heparin has been initiated to prevent this complication.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is currently experiencing acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function is essential to prevent further deterioration"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), presenting after respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and had an initial EF of 10% with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient's EF improved to 35% on [12-10]. Currently, the patient has leukocytosis of unclear origin.

The patient has a history of three-vessel disease (3VD) with recent in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the obtuse marginal (OM) artery. The patient underwent repeat catheterization, which showed 3VD and no intervention was performed. The patient is currently on medical management with aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, captopril, and heparin.

The patient's echocardiogram showed an EF of 35%, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is in place. The patient's severe MR may worsen with his current dilated left ventricle (LV). The patient required an increase in Lasix gtt to 12mg/hr to obtain urine output (U/O) > 100cc. The patient's left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is 25mmHg, wedge pressure (WP) is 19mmHg, and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) is 9mmHg. The patient's cardiac index (CI) is 3.7, indicating some degree of heart failure. The patient appears euvolemic on exam, but still has elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), which has been unchanged since [12-14]. The patient continues to have oxygen requirement, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient has been treated for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient remains febrile, and sputum now shows gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient's antibiotics will be continued, and cultures will be followed up today.

The patient has a stage II ulcer, documented on arrival to the coronary critical care unit (CCU). There are no signs of infection, and a wound consult has been ordered. The patient's wound will be turned every two hours for now, and if it opens up, dressings may be considered.

The patient's anemia responded appropriately to a second unit of blood. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) continues to be low but stable, with today's value at 28%. The patient initially dropped HCT at the other hospital, but the baseline is unclear. The patient has iron deficiency and alpha-thalassemia trait.

The patient has acute renal failure (AR"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Extubation yesterday was successful.  MS still not clear and unclear
   why.  Given zyprexa to control agitation.  Dig level checked
   (pending).  Started Captopril 6.25mg PO TID. Sputum showing 1+ GNRs
   with no growth on culture (plan to treat for 8 days, then stop abx).
   Overnight pt was found out of bed with no evidence of fall (knees were
   on a pillow, upper part of body still on bed).  Four side rails
   ordered.  Pt desatted while OOB, w/ O2 sats to 92, and ABG was checked
   and suctioned  and chest pt were performed and sats improved to 95%.

   - plan for extubation today
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation at transfer, continues to be in afib.
   Unclear if he has been in this rhythm in the past.  Currently rate
   controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV  gtt
   - Patient will likely require coumadin as OP.
   # PULM:  Respiratory failure likely due to CHF though was treated for
   PNA at OSH.  Has been on Vanc and Zosyn for possible VAP.  Continues to
   be febrile, sputum now showing GNRs.
   - con
t vanc and zosyn. Today is day #7 of Vancomycin, day #8 of zosyn
   (was started at OSH prior to admission)
   - Extubate today
   - f/u cultures
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented on arrival to CCU.  No signs of
   infection.  Wound consult.
   - Turn Q2H for now, if wound opens up will consider dressings.
   # ANEMIA:  Pt responded to 2^nd unit appropriately.  HCT cont to be low
   but stable, today is 28.  Drop noted at the OSH initially..  Baseline
   is unclear though most likely in the low 30s.  Fe studies consistent w/
   combination of Fe deficiency and ACD.
   - continue to monitor
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently stable at 2.2.  FEURea
   12%, strongly suggestive of pre-renal, likely due to aggressive
   diuresis.  Most likely the baseline is higher than Cr of 1 as pt
   continues to be slightly volume up.  Will monitor for ATN.
   -          Monitor after adding Captopril
   -          Will monitor Cr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction (EF). He presented with respiratory failure and was found to have an EF of 10% with 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient also has a history of in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal (OM) artery. 

The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with beta-blockers. He is also on heparin IV gtt and will likely require coumadin as outpatient medication. The patient has been treated for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and Zosyn. He continues to be febrile, and his sputum now shows GNRs. 

The patient has an ulcer, classified as stage II, which is non-infected. Wound consult has been ordered. The patient's anemia is likely due to iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). His renal function is stable, with a serum creatinine (Cr) level of 2.2. However, there is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to aggressive diuresis. The patient's baseline Scr is believed to be in the high 1s. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving regular nutrition, aggressive blood glucose control, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction (EF). He presented with respiratory failure and was found to have an EF of 10% with 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient also has a known 3-vessel disease (3VD) with in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the obtuse marginal (OM). He underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed 3VD but no intervention was performed.

The patient is currently on medical management, including aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, heparin, and Lasix. He is also being treated for atrial fibrillation with beta-blockers and has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient's severe MR may be worsened due to his dilated left ventricle (LV), and he requires an increased dose of Lasix to maintain urine output (U/O) greater than 100cc. His LVEDP is 25mmHg, wedge pressure is 19mmHg, and RVEDP is 9mmHg. His cardiac index (CI) is 3.7, and he appears euvolemic on exam but has an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP).

The patient has been treated for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Van"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. He presented with respiratory failure and was found to have an EF of 35% on December 10th. The patient has been in the ICU since then and has been treated for various medical conditions.

Recent events include successful extubation yesterday, but the patient's mental status (MS) remains unclear. The patient was pancultured on December 13th and started on Captopril 6.25mg PO TID. Sputum shows 1+ GNRs with no growth on culture and will be treated for 8 days before stopping antibiotics.

Overnight, the patient was found out of bed with no evidence of a fall. He desatted while out of bed, with oxygen saturation levels dropping to the 90s on 3LNC. An arterial blood gas (ABG) was checked, and the patient was suctioned and chest pits were performed, which improved his saturation levels to 95% on 3LNC.

The patient has been on multiple medications including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and other ICU medications. He also has a history of known coronary artery disease with in-stent restenosis of saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch. The patient underwent cardiac catheter"

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, presenting with respiratory failure. He was found to have an ejection fraction (EF) of 10% but improved to an EF of 35% on [**12-10**]. The patient now presents with leukocytosis of unclear origin.

The patient has known three-vessel disease (3VD) with recent in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery (SVG to OM). Repeat catheterization showed 3VD, but no intervention was performed. The patient is being managed medically.

The patient's pump function is described as having an EF of 35%, and an ICD is in place. Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) may be worsened by his dilated left ventricle (LV). The patient required an increase in Lasix gtt to 12mg/hr to obtain urine output (U/O) > 100cc. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is 25 mmHg, wedge pressure is 19 mmHg, and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) is 9 mmHg. Cardiac index (CI) is 3.7.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with history of coronary artery disease and depressed EF,
   presenting after respiratory failure, found to have EF of 10% with
   3+MR, improved to EF of 35% on [**12-10**].  Was intubated, now extuabated
   with leukocytosis, treating for PNA.
   # PULM:  Hypoxemia initially felt to be [**2-9**] CHF, but also has been
   treated for PNA given CXR findings and leukocytosis (developed after
   ABx initiation).    BCx negative to date.  Has been on Vanc and Zosyn
   for possible VAP.  Has been afebrile with sputums showing GNRs and no
   growth on culture.  Pt. continues to be tachypneic w/ RR in 25-30.
   Source of this unclear.  CXR consistent with volume overload.
   - Con
t vancomycin and zosyn for VVAP.  Day # 9 of Vancomycin, day # 10
   of zosyn, plan is for 10 day course total (last day is tomorrow).
   - Continue pulmonary toilet with chest PT
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix gtt and Chlorothiazide with goal of -1L
   today
   # Leukocytosis.  Source unclear.  UA from [**12-13**] and Cx negative, [**12-16**]
   Urine cultures negative.  BCx negative to date.  Has been on Vanc and
   Zosyn for possible VAP, CXR w/ persistent RLL infiltrate.  Afebrile
   x3d, sputum GNRs but no growth on Cx.  Foley in place.  Aline d/ced.  C
   diff negative X 1.  [**Month (only) 11**] be stress response given that platelets are
   also rising.
   - F/U BCx, Sputum and Urine studies.
   - Cont. ABx as above.
   - Will send 2^nd C. Diff
   # Altered mental status.  Pt waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], most likely delirium
   [**2-9**] ICU setting and previous intubation/sedation.  Slowly improving but
   pt continues to be agitated.  Has not received any psychotropic meds
   but was on scopolamine.  Possibly [**2-9**] underlying infection, ICU
   delirium is most likley.  D/ced all lines, but pt continues to require
   supplemental O2.  No localizable neurologic findings on exam.  CT head
   of low yield.
   - Frequent reorientation, wean O2 as tolerated to remove NC, will
   attempt to minimize restraint use
   - continue to mobilize patient, OOB to chair, sleep hygiene (maintain
   awake status throughout the day, lights off at night, TV off)
   - Will try standing Seroquel 25mg PO qHS for sedation with PRN Haldol
   or Zyprexa
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret with RBBB, has
   anterior ST changes.   Repeat cath again showing 3VD, no intervention.
   [**Hospital 2679**] medical management.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Continue  Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Captopril 12.5  mg PO TID, will change to lisinopril prior to d/c.
   # PUMP:  Echo here showed EF 35%, ICD in place.  His severe MR may be
   worsened with his current dilated LV.  Required lasix gtt increase to
   12mg/hr to obtain U/O > 100cc.  Per cath [**2137-12-12**], LVEDP
 25, Wedge of
   19 and RVEDP of 9mmHg.  CI 3.7.  Patient appears euvolemic on exam, but
   still has elevated JVP, this has been unchanged since [**12-14**].  Pt.
   continues to have O2 requirement, likely from failure.
   - Lasix gtt today with Chlorothiazide for goal diuresis
 1L.
   - Continue BBk, Captopril 12.5mg PO TID to decrease afterload in this
   pt w/ severe MR.  Goal BPs < 120 systolic w/o orthostatics.
   - continue Heparin for LV thrombus, transitioning to Coumadin
   # RHYTHM:  Continues to be in afib.  Unclear if he has been in this
   rhythm in the past.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - Heparin IV gtt, will transitioning to coumadin, PTT at goal, INR 1.4
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented on arrival to CCU.  No signs of
   infection.  Wound consult.
   - Turn Q2H for now, if wound opens up will consider dressings.
   # ANEMIA:  HCT cont to be low but stable, today is 27.  Baseline is
   unclear though most likely in the low 30s.  Fe studies consistent w/
   combination of Fe deficiency and ACD.
   - continue to monitor
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently stable at 2.4.  FEURea
   12%, strongly suggestive of pre-renal, likely due to aggressive
   diuresis.  Most likely the baseline is higher than Cr of 1 as pt
   continues to be slightly volume up, baseline likely 2.2-2.4.  Will
   monitor for ATN.
   - continue to monitor

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction, presenting after respiratory failure and found to have an ejection fraction of 10% with moderate mitral regurgitation. He underwent cardiac catheterization with no intervention. The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia, which was given 500cc of D5W and rechecked at 143 in the evening. He is recommended to have thin liquids and ground solids, with pills crushed in purees due to speech and swallow difficulties. The patient was agitated overnight and received IV Haldol, Zyprexa, and Ativan. He also received an extra dose of Metoprolol for tachycardia. Lasix 80mg IV was administered twice yesterday for diuresis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 97 bpm (69-131 bpm), blood pressure of 115/62 mmHg (76-117/37-98 mmHg), respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute (20-33 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight is 71.7 kg (admission weight: 77.6 kg) and height is 70 inches.

   s/p cath with no intervention.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient continued to have a leukocytosis, but was afebrile.  His
   nitro gtt was weaned off in the am.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] he wants a full 10
   days of both antibiotics (so they can be dc'ed on Wednesday).  His
   captopril was increased to 12.5 mg tid for afterload reduction.  He was
   given 500 cc of D5W for correction of hypernatremia his Na on recheck
   in the evening was 143 (from 150).  He is transitioning on coumadin,
   still on a heparin gtt.  His famotidine and scopolamine were stopped
   given his continued confusion.  He recevied 80 mg of lasix IV x1 per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] for a goal of 1 L negative.  Speech and swallow saw him and
   recommended thin liquids and ground consistency solids with supervision
   and pills to be crushed in purees.
   Due to agitation he was given haldol 0.5 mg IV x1, then 1 mg IV x1.
   Later on in the night he was given 5 mg of zyprexa for agitation.  He
   continued to have more agitation and was given 0.5 mg of lorazepam and
   then another 1 mg IV haldol.  He had HRs in the 120's to 130's (EKG
   showed a.fib with RBBB - unchanged from previous EKGs).  His
   tachycardia was likely secondary to his agitation; however his rates
   only returned to the 100s once he quieted down so he was given an extra
   po dose of metoprolol 25 mg x1.  Also gave 80 mg IV lasix at night as
   he was only 300 cc negative and his goal was 1 L negative.

   TTE [**12-16**]:   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. The left ventricular cavity is severely
   dilated with severe hypo/akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
   walls and mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
   25-30 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
   depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared
   with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-12-10**], the distal
   anterior function is improved and the severity of tricuspid
   regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are lower.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction (EF). He presented to the ICU after respiratory failure and was found to have an EF of 10% with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization with no intervention. 

The patient has been experiencing leukocytosis of unclear origin, which has been treated as possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, with plans for a total of 10-14 days of antibiotics. 

The patient also has altered mental status, possibly due to delirium in the ICU setting. His confusion and agitation have been managed with haloperidol. 

He has a history of coronary artery disease and in-stent restenosis of a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch. 

His heart function has shown improvement from an initial EF of 35% to around 25-30%. The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen. 

He has a non-healing stage II ulcer with blisters and is at risk for complications such as infection. 

The patient's renal function is stable with a baseline creatinine level of 2.2-2.4. He has been on aggressive diuresis, which may have caused a pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI).

   presenting after respiratory failure, found to have EF of 10% with
   3+MR, improved to EF of 35% on [**12-10**].  Was intubated, now extuabated
   with leukocytosis, treating for PNA.
   # PULM:  Hypoxemia initially felt to be [**2-9**] CHF, but also has been
   treated for PNA given CXR findings and leukocytosis (developed after
   ABx initiation).    BCx negative to date.  Has been on Vanc and Zosyn
   for possible VAP, completed 10d course.  CXR unchanged from prior.  Has
   been afebrile with sputums showing GNRs and no growth on culture.  Pt.
   continues to be tachypneic w/ RR in 25-30.  Source of this unclear, but
   unlikely PNA at this point.  CXR changes persistent likely [**2-9**] old
   PNA..
   - Discontinue vancomycin and zosyn, completed 10d.
   - Continue pulmonary toilet with chest PT
   - Continue diuresis goal of -1L today
   # Leukocytosis.  Source unclear.  UA from [**12-13**] and Cx negative, [**12-16**]
   Urine cultures negative.  BCx negative to date.  Has been on Vanc and
   Zosyn for possible VAP, CXR w/ persistent RLL infiltrate.  Afebrile
   x4d, sputum GNRs but no growth on Cx.  Foley in place.  Aline d/ced.  C
   diff negative X 2.  [**Month (only) 11**] be stress response given that platelets are
   also rising.  No sinus tenderness on exam, no post nasal drip.  Will
   consider sinus CT of persistent WBC elevation and fever.
   - F/U BCx, Sputum studies.
   - d/c ABx
   # Altered mental status.  Pt waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], most likely delirium
   [**2-9**] ICU setting and previous intubation/sedation.  Slowly improving but
   pt continues to be agitated at times.  Seroquel with good effect.
   D/ced all lines, but pt continues to require supplemental O2, this is
   likely [**2-9**] CHF.  No localizable neurologic findings on exam.  CT head
   of low yield.
   - Frequent reorientation, wean O2 as tolerated to remove NC, will
   attempt to minimize restraint use
   - continue to mobilize patient, OOB to chair, sleep hygiene (maintain
   awake status throughout the day, lights off at night, TV off)
   - Contianue Seroquel 25mg PO qHS for sedation with PRN Haldol
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret with RBBB, has
   anterior ST changes.   Repeat cath again showing 3VD, no intervention.
   [**Hospital 2679**] medical management.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Change  Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] to Carvedilol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] give elevated
   BPs.
   - Captopril 12.5 mg PO TID, will change to lisinopril prior to d/c.
   # PUMP:  Echo here showed EF 35%, ICD in place.  His severe MR may be
   worsened with his current dilated LV.   Required 10mg/hr lasix gtt for
   negative 1.3L.  Per cath [**2137-12-12**], LVEDP
 25, Wedge of 19 and RVEDP of
   9mmHg.  CI 3.7.  Patient appears euvolemic on exam, but still has
   elevated JVP, this has been unchanged since [**12-14**].  Pt. continues to
   have O2 requirement, likely from failure.
   - Will change lasix gtt to PO lasix 160 qam w/ metolazone 5mg and 80mg
   in afternoon, goal diuresis
 1L.
   - Change to carvedilol, continue Captopril 12.5mg PO TID to decrease
   afterload in this pt w/ severe MR.  Goal BPs < 120 systolic w/o
   orthostatics.
   - d/ced Heparin, now on warfarin for LV thrombus and afib, goal INR [**2-10**]
   # RHYTHM:  Continues to be in afib.  Unclear if he has been in this
   rhythm in the past.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Beta-blocker, as above
   - On coumadin, INR 3.1, will hold dose today and restart tomorrow at
   2.5mg.
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented on arrival to CCU.  No signs of
   infection.  Wound consult.
   - Turn Q2H for now, if wound opens up will consider dressings.
   # ANEMIA:  HCT cont to be low but stable, today is 28.  Baseline is
   unclear though most likely in the low 30s.  Fe studies consistent w/
   combination of Fe deficiency and ACD.
   - continue to monitor
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently stable at 2.4.  FEURea
   12%, strongly suggestive of pre-renal, likely due to aggressive
   diuresis.  Most likely the baseline is higher than Cr of 1 as pt
   continues to be slightly volume up, baseline likely 2.2-2.4.  Will
   monitor for ATN.
   - continue to monitor
   # FEN:  Cardiac, diabetic diet, replete electrolytes PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). He presented with respiratory failure and was found to have an ejection fraction of 10% with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), which improved to an ejection fraction of 35% after treatment. The patient was intubated and then extubated, and is currently in the ICU for further management.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: Initially thought to be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), but also treated for possible pneumonia (PNA) given the chest X-ray findings and leukocytosis. The patient has been on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but completed a 10-day course. The sputum culture showed no growth, and the patient remains afebrile with ongoing tachypnea. The source of this respiratory issue is unclear, but it is unlikely to be PNA at this point.

2. Leukocytosis: The source of leukocytosis is unclear, with negative urine cultures and blood cultures. The patient has been on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but will discontinue these antibiotics as they have completed their course. The persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray is likely an old pneumonia.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing delirium, likely due to the ICU setting and previous intubation/sedation. He has been agitated at times, but is slowly improving. Seroquel has been effective in managing his agitation.

4. Coronaries: The patient has known coronary artery disease with in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery. He has undergone cardiac catheterization showing triple vessel disease (3VD), but no intervention was performed. The patient will continue with aspirin and clopidogrel.

5. Pump: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction has improved from 10% to 35%. He has an implanted ICD and severe mitral regurgitation, which may worsen with his dilated left ventricle. The patient required 10mg/hr lasix gtt for negative 1.3L fluid balance. His left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is 25, wedge pressure is 19, and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) is 9mmHg. Cardiac index is 3.7. The patient appears euvolemic on examination, but still has elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), which has been unchanged since admission. He continues to require supplemental oxygen, likely due to heart failure.

6. Rhythm: The patient continues to"

   with leukocytosis, treating for PNA.
   # PULM:  Hypoxemia initially felt to be [**2-9**] CHF, but also has been
   treated for PNA given CXR findings and leukocytosis (developed after
   ABx initiation).    BCx negative to date.  Has been on Vanc and Zosyn
   for possible VAP, completed 10d course.  CXR unchanged from prior.  Has
   been afebrile with sputums showing GNRs and no growth on culture.  Pt.
   continues to be tachypneic w/ RR in 25-30.  Source of this unclear, but
   unlikely PNA at this point.  CXR changes persistent likely [**2-9**] old

   elevated JVP, this has been unchanged since [**12-14**].  Pt. continues to
   have O2 requirement, likely from failure.
   - Will change lasix gtt to PO lasix 160 qam w/ metolazone 5mg and 80mg
   in afternoon, goal diuresis
 1L.
   - Change to carvedilol, continue Captopril 12.5mg PO TID to decrease

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), and previous respiratory failure. He presented with hypoxemia initially felt to be heart failure but also treated for pneumonia (PNA) given chest X-ray findings and leukocytosis. The patient has been on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), completed a 10-day course. He remains tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 25-30, which is unclear but unlikely to be PNA at this point. The CXR changes are persistent, likely 2-9 days old PNA. The patient has leukocytosis, source unclear, with negative urinalysis and cultures. He has a Foley catheter in place. There is no sinus tenderness on exam, and no post-nasal drip. The patient's mental status is altered, likely delirium in the ICU setting and previous intubation/sedation. He is improving but continues to be agitated at times. Seroquel has been effective for sedation. The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF). There are no localizable neurological findings on exam. A CT head showed low yield.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), presenting with respiratory failure. He has been treated for possible pneumonia (PNA), but recent sputum cultures have shown no growth. The patient continues to be tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 25-30 breaths per minute, and the source of this is unclear. His chest X-ray shows persistent right lower lobe infiltrate, likely representing an old PNA.

The patient also has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.7-16.0 K/uL, but the source is unclear. Urine cultures have been negative, and blood cultures have also been negative to date. The patient has been on vancomycin and Zosyn for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but these antibiotics have been discontinued as the patient has completed a 10-day course.

Additionally, the patient has an altered mental status, most likely delirium due to the ICU setting and previous intubation/sedation. He is slowly improving but continues to be agitated at times. Seroquel has been effective in managing his agitation.

The patient's medical history includes known coronary artery disease with recent in-stent restenosis of the saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his ECG shows anterior ST"

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with history of coronary artery disease and depressed EF,
   presenting after respiratory failure, found to have EF of 10% with
   3+MR, improved to EF of 35% now extubated and afebrile off antibiotics.
   # PULM:  Hypoxemia initially felt to be [**2-9**] CHF, but also had been
   treated for PNA given CXR findings and leukocytosis (developed after
   ABx initiation).    BCx negative to date.  Has been on Vanc and Zosyn
   for possible VAP, completed 10d course.  CXR unchanged from prior.  Has
   been afebrile with sputums showing GNRs and no growth on culture.  Pt.
   continues to be tachypneic w/ RR in 25-30.  Source of this unclear, but
   unlikely PNA at this point.  CXR changes persistent yesterday likely
   [**2-9**] old PNA..  Vanc and zosyn were stopped on [**12-18**].  The patient was
   600 cc negative yesterday and is negative 9.9 L for his ICU stay this
   am.  Patient now sating in the high 90
s on 2L.
   - Continue pulmonary toilet with chest PT
   - Continue maintenance diuretics with metolazone 5 mg daily and 160 mg
   lasix qam and 80 mg of lasix qpm.
   # Leukocytosis.  WBC decreased to 13.6 today from 14.4 yesterday.
   Source unclear.  UA from [**12-13**] and Cx negative, [**12-16**] Urine cultures
   negative.  BCx negative to date.  Had been on Vanc and Zosyn (were
   stopped on [**12-18**]) for possible VAP, CXR w/ persistent RLL infiltrate.
   Afebrile x5d, sputum GNRs but no growth on Cx.  C diff negative X 2.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be stress response given that platelets are also rising.
   - Will continue to follow and CIS.
   # Altered mental status.  Resolved.  This am the patient is alert and
   oriented x3.  The patient
s change in mental status was likely delirium
   as he was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], most likely delirium [**2-9**] ICU setting and
   previous intubation/sedation.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with most recent cath showing in-stent
   restenosis of SVG to OM.  ECG difficult to interpret with RBBB, has
   anterior ST changes.   Repeat cath again showing 3VD, no intervention.
   [**Hospital 2679**] medical management.
   - Continue with aspirin and plavix
   - Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  Echo here showed EF 35%,
   ICD in place.  His severe MR may be worsened with his current dilated
   LV.  Patient appears euvolemic on exam, but still has elevated JVP,
   this has been unchanged since [**12-14**].  Pt. continues to have O2
   requirement, likely from failure.
   - Continue diuresis with PO lasix 160 qam w/ metolazone 5mg and 80mg in
   afternoon, goal diuresis
 1L.
   - Continue carvedilol and change Captopril 12.5mg PO TID to lisinopril
   20 mg daily decrease afterload in this pt w/ severe MR.  Goal BPs < 120
   systolic w/o orthostatics.
   - d/ced Heparin, now on warfarin for LV thrombus and afib, goal INR [**2-10**]
   # RHYTHM:  Continues to be in afib.  Unclear if he has been in this
   rhythm in the past.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Carvedilol, as above
   - On coumadin, INR 2.9.  His dose was held yesterday.  Will restart
   today at a lower dose of  2.5mg.
   # Ucler, stage II.  Documented on arrival to CCU.  No signs of
   infection.  Wound consult.
   - Turn Q2H for now, if wound opens up will consider dressings.
   # ANEMIA:  HCT cont to be low but stable, today is 29.0.  Baseline is
   unclear though most likely in the low 30s.  Fe studies consistent w/
   combination of Fe deficiency and ACD.
   - continue to monitor
   # RENAL FAILURE:  ARF on CKD.  Based on old labs, appears to have CKD
   with baseline SCr in the high 1s.  Currently stable at 2.2 (from 2.2).
   FEURea 12%, strongly suggestive of pre-renal, likely due to aggressive
   diuresis.  Most likely the baseline is higher than Cr of 1 as pt
   continues to be slightly volume up, baseline likely 2.2-2.4.  Will
   monitor for ATN.
   - continue to monitor
   # FEN:  Cardiac, diabetic diet, replete electrolytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis protonix
   40mg for ulcer prophylaxis given asa, plavix and coumadin, pt is on

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and depressed ejection fraction. He presented with respiratory failure and was found to have an ejection fraction of 10% with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. The patient has been improving and is now extubated and afebrile, off antibiotics.

The patient was treated for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and completed a 10-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, the sputum cultures showed no growth, and the chest X-ray changes were likely old. Therefore, the antibiotics were stopped on December 18th.

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.7-16.0 K/uL, but the source is unclear. The urinalysis and urine cultures are negative, and the blood cultures are also negative. The patient is still tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the 25-30 range, which may be due to an underlying condition such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or a non-infectious cause.

The patient has been on diuretics with metolazone 5 mg daily and 160 mg lasix qam and 80 mg of lasix qpm. His fluid balance has been negative overall, with a total fluid intake of 1,877 mL and a total fluid output of 2,480 mL, resulting in a balance of -603 mL. The patient is also receiving carvedilol 12.5 mg daily for rate control in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a stage II ulcer on the right buttock, which is being monitored. There are no signs of infection, and wound consult has been requested.

The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, which is likely due to a combination of iron deficiency and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renal failure is also present, with a baseline creatinine level in the high 1s, and the current level is stable at 2.2. The FEUrea is 12%, indicating pre-renal azotemia likely due to aggressive diuresis.

Overall, the patient's medical complications include CHF, possible VAP (resolved), leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, stage II ulcer, anemia, and renal failure. The patient is being closely monitored for any changes in condition and will continue with the current management plan."
