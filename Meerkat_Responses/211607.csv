","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, hypertension, depression/anxiety, lower extremity edema, stress incontinence, and bone health issues. She is currently admitted to the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation due to failure to wean.

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 91 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 98/65 mmHg to 127/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a tracheostomy tube with ventilator support.

The lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, normal platelet count of 341 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 175 mg/dL. Other lab values including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, PT/PTT/INR, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status. The plan includes evaluating the possibility of tracheal stenosis contributing to the failure to wean from the ventilator, checking coag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of difficulty weaning from the ventilator. She has a history of severe COPD and tracheostomy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/65-71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is being delivered oxygen at a flow rate of 50%. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, blood glucose level of 175 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L. Other labs include PT/PTT/INR, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Plan:
The plan includes evaluating the patient for tracheal stenosis as a possible factor in the difficulty to wean from the ventilator. This will involve checking the plateau pressure and calculating resistance. The healthcare team will also touch base with the patient's pulmonologist and physician from another hospital for more information on her past medical history. The patient is likely to undergo a bronchoscopy in the morning. Coagulation studies and cardiac monitoring will be continued. The patient's current"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She has a history of severe COPD, deconditioning, anxiety, and possible mechanical reasons for difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/65-71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set at a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7 cmH2O, and fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral diffuse wheezes, which are mild in intensity. There is also evidence of lower extremity edema, particularly on the right side. Neurological examination shows no acute distress or abnormalities. 

Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and electrolyte levels, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L. The patient's glucose level is within normal range.

Plan:
1. Obtain outside records to assess the severity of COPD.
2. Implement an intensive pulmonary rehabilitation plan to evaluate for tracheomalacia tomorrow"

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has a history of severe COPD, hypertension, depression/anxiety, lower extremity edema, stress incontinence, and bone health issues. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 91 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 98/65 mmHg to 127/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a tracheostomy tube with ventilator support. 

Her hemodynamic monitoring shows normal readings for fluid balance, and she has received a total of 325 mL of fluids since 30 AM. 

The patient's recent laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 341 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and glucose level of 175 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment includes failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, presumed severe COPD, and potential tracheal stenosis. The plan is for an interventional procedure evaluation in the morning. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with severe COPD who is currently experiencing respiratory failure and has been unable to be weaned from the ventilator. The patient's medical history includes COPD, hypertension, anxiety, and lower extremity edema. The patient is also taking multiple medications including aripiprazole, loratadine, lorazepam, vitamin D, lopressor, albuterol, fluticasone, MVI, amlodipine, Paxil, lansoprazole, theophylline, lasix, bactrim, and oxybutynin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation: The patient's inability to be weaned from the ventilator suggests that there may be barriers to extubation, which could include factors such as anxiety, weakness, and possible tracheomalacia. Further evaluation and management are needed to address these issues.

2. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient has severe COPD, and any exacerbation of this condition could lead to increased respiratory distress and potentially worsen her current respiratory failure.

3. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension may contribute to her overall cardiovascular risk and could potentially lead to complications such as heart failure or stroke if not adequately controlled.

4. Lower extremity edema: The presence of edema in the patient's lower extremities may indicate underlying issues such as venous ins"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with difficulty weaning off the ventilator in the ICU. The patient has chronic respiratory failure, severe COPD, and possible tracheal stenosis contributing to the difficulty in weaning. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/72 mmHg to 154/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose levels, and prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient is currently on several medications for COPD, hypertension, depression/anxiety, lower extremity edema, stress incontinence, and bone health. She also has prophylactic measures in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include worsening respiratory failure due to the inability to wean off the ventilator, infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, and potential bleeding complications due to prolonged clotting times."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with chronic lung disease who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has difficulty weaning off the ventilator, which suggests severe COPD. There is also a possibility of tracheal stenosis contributing to the difficulty in weaning. The patient's recent medical history includes chronic lower extremity edema, negative bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), treatment with lasix for the edema, and positive MRSA sputum cultures treated with bactrim.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/72 to 154/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient is awake, alert, and oriented x 3. Physical examination findings include rales in the lungs and obesity.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (352 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin (8.6 g/dL), elevated blood glucose (175 mg/dL), normal sodium (140 mg/dL), slightly low potassium (3.6 mEq/L), and normal liver function tests. Other labs are within normal range.

The patient's current plan includes an IP evaluation in the morning for difficulty weaning from the vent"

She has bilateral lower extremity (LE) edema, which has been treated with lasix. The patient also has a history of MRSA-positive sputum cultures and is currently being treated with bactrim. There is no reported history of increased cough, sputum, fever, or white blood cell count to correlate with an active infection.

The patient is on a tracheostomy tube and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination reveals diffuse wheezes and poor air movement in the lungs, regular rapid regular rhythm in the cardiovascular system, obesity in the abdomen, and 1+ bilateral LE edema.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and normal electrolyte levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with COPD who is currently experiencing respiratory failure and awaiting an inpatient procedure. The patient has been on several medications, including albuterol/atrovent, beclamethasone, theophylline, steroids, and diuretics. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but they show signs of fluid retention with edema in both lower extremities. The patient's blood work indicates some abnormalities, such as elevated glucose levels and slightly low platelet count. The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation. The patient's mental status is described as purposeful and normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in hypoxemia or hypercapnia.
2. Fluid Overload: The presence of edema in both lower extremities indicates fluid retention, which can increase the risk of pulmonary edema or heart failure.
3. Diuretic Resistance: The patient's inability to tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV) and the need for increased diuretics suggest a possible diuretic resistance, which can worsen fluid overload and respiratory status.
4. Infection: The colonization of MRSA and the use of antibiotics indicate a possible infection, which can complicate the patient's condition and lead to sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male in the ICU with chronic respiratory failure. They were admitted due to bronchial edema of subglottic and supraglottic structures. The patient has a history of COPD and requires ventilatory support. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/50-130/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with set tidal volume of 400 mL, set respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 7 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and shows an RSBI of 144. The plateau pressure is 26 cmH2O, and the SpO2 is 100%. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (367 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (8.5 g/dL), normal sodium (135 mg/dL), slightly low potassium (3.7 mEq/L), normal chloride (96 mEq/L), slightly elevated bicarbonate (26.2%), low magnesium (1.8 mg/dL), normal BUN (23 mg/dL), creatinine (1.2 mg/dL), TCO2 (57), glucose (175), and other lab values within normal range. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in peripheral vascular or neurologic assessments. The patient is currently not assessed for skin, tone, or movement. 

Plan:
The patient is planned to undergo an IP bronch to assess if they would benefit from a tracheostomy stent. They are to be kept NPO, continue the current COPD regimen, and continue current ventilator settings. 

The patient's COPD is being managed with a steroid taper, continuation of theophylline, fluticasone, ipratropium/albuterol, and albuterol as needed. The FiO2 is to be titrated to maintain oxygen saturation above 93%. 

An ABG is scheduled this morning, and consideration is being given to starting acetazolamide to reduce bicarbonate in the presence of respiratory acidosis. Diuretics are to be held. 

The patient's hypertension is stable, and they are to continue on amlodipine and metoprolol. 

Depression/anxiety medications are to be continued. 

Lasix is being held due to contraction alkalosis, and acetazolamide is to be started to reduce bicarbonate."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, hypertension, depression/anxiety, and lower extremity edema. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy tube with CMV mode, set Vt of 400 mL, RR set at 12, PEEP at 7 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and RSBI of 144. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/57 mmHg to 130/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert, oriented, and in no apparent distress.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes. However, there is an elevated blood glucose level of 175 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still unable to wean off the ventilator, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. The underlying cause of this failure could be related to their chronic respiratory condition or a recent COPD flare-up. Close monitoring and continued treatment for COPD are necessary.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable, but it is"
