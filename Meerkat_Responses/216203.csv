","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with NSTEMI and was found to have three-vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. She has a stent in the right coronary artery (RCA) placed approximately 10 years ago. The patient declined surgical intervention, and cardiac surgery was consulted, stating that she is a poor surgical candidate.

The patient is currently in the ICU for further management. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/74 mmHg to 152/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 700 units per hour.

The patient's physical examination reveals multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) on telemetry, bibasilar crackles in the lungs, and diminished pulses in both lower extremities. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and troponin-T levels. Her electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's current medications include Plavix, atorvastatin, aspirin (ASA) 325 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg, and heparin gtt. The plan is to continue these medications, monitor the groin site after cardiac catheterization, and hold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) due to hypo/normotensive state. The patient is also scheduled for a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) today to assess for RCA territory hypokinesis and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

The patient has a history of melanoma and recently underwent excision of right inguinal lymph nodes. She also has a history of dementia, for which she is taking donepezil, and depression and attention deficit disorder (ADD), for which she is taking wellbutrin and methylphenidate, respectively.

The patient's disposition remains in the CCU for now."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have three-vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA).

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including dementia, depression, attention deficit disorder (ADD), melanoma, and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and 3VD, there is a risk of recurrent myocardial ischemia, unstable angina, or subsequent myocardial infarction. Close monitoring of cardiac function and ongoing assessment of chest pain are essential.
2. Bleeding complications: Due to the patient being on anticoagulation therapy with heparin, there is a risk of bleeding at the catheterization site or other sites. Regular monitoring of clotting parameters and careful management of any bleeding episodes are necessary.
3. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections. Infection control measures and appropriate antibiotic usage should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. She underwent a stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA) approximately 10 years ago. The patient declined surgical intervention, and cardiac surgery consultation determined that she is a poor surgical candidate. Currently, she is in the intensive care unit (ICU) with ongoing management for her cardiac condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of CAD and presented with NSTEMI. She has diffuse 3VD, indicating significant coronary artery disease. This increases the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
2. Heart Failure: The patient demonstrates signs of diastolic heart failure, including elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and symptoms such as crackles on physical examination and elevated jugular venous distention (JVD).
3. Arrhythmias: The patient has multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) on telemetry. This indicates an increased risk of developing more severe arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The cardiac catheterization revealed diffuse three-vessel disease (3VD). The patient is a poor surgical candidate, and surgical intervention has been declined. The plan includes a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) today to assess for RCA territory hypokinesis and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Consideration will be given to RCA stent placement versus aggressive medical management. The patient will continue on Plavix, Atorvastatin, and ASA 325 mg daily. Metoprolol 25 mg will be continued and uptitrated as tolerated. Monitoring of the groin site post-catheterization will be continued, and an ACE inhibitor may be started later today if blood pressure permits. Heparin will be continued for 48 hours. Nitroglycerin will be weaned off. Diuretics will be continued, aiming for an intake/output goal of -500 cc to 1 L today. Lasix 40 mg PO will be administered daily and previously given Lasix will be discontinued. The patient's rhythm will be monitored on telemetry, and multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) will be watched for. Additional assessments and plans are outlined for the patient's melanoma, dementia, psychosocial issues,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed diffuse three-vessel disease (3VD). The patient also has a history of melanoma and has undergone excision of right inguinal lymph nodes. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications.

24-hour events include the conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm (SR) with the use of amiodarone and low PTT, for which she received a 900 unit bolus and 650 units per hour. The patient experienced chest pain, which was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin (SL NTG) and IV morphine. She also had a positive urine analysis (UA), indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was started on ciprofloxacin, but her condition worsened, so she was switched to IV ciprofloxacin and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 87 yo female with h/o CAD s/p stent to RCA who
   presented from OSH with NSTEMI and was found to have 3VD via cardiac
   cath.
   .
   # Chest pain: patient describes pleuritic pain and has a pericardial
   rub on exam.  Possible post-MI inflammation causing pericarditis vs.
   infectious pericarditis.  Raises possibility that initial event was
   also secondary to pericarditis, though this seems less likely.
   - Avoid NSAIDs in peri-infarction period. Treat with symptomatic pain
   relief.
   .
   # UTI: Had a positive UA yesterday, diaphoretic on exam today, and has
   a rising WBC.  Started on ciprofloxacin, though she may be worsening on
   current PO antibiotic therapy.  Switch to IV ciprofloxacin and consider
   broadening.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures.
   - monitor closely.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p stent to RCA
   approximately 10 yo at [**Hospital 1534**] Hospital.  The patient presented with
   chest pain in the setting of CE elevation, consistent with NSTEMI.
   Cardiac cath showed diffuse 3VD.  CTSurg was consulted, and they stated
   that the patient is a poor surgical candidate. Pt also declines
   surgical intervention. TTE yesterday showed LVEF 45% and pt c/o
   recurrent unstable angina ON w/ + CE (pleritic vs cardiac)
    - Re-evaluate RCA stent placement v. aggressive medical management
   - SL NTG Morphine for CP; CXR this AM to evaluate pleuritic vs. cardiac
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA 325 mg daily, Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   and uptitrate as tolerated
    - Hold ACEI; currently hypo/normotensive
   - Continue to monitor groin site s/p cath
    - Stop heparin gtt.
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in NSR despite Afib most of yesterday.
   - Continue Amio gtt X 18 hrs, then start 400 mg PO BID tonight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry

   #. Diastolic CHF:  The patient had evidence of elevated LVEDP in
   cardiac cath.  Pt given 250NC bolus yesterday for Afib, then Lasix for
   decreased U/O. Today continues to be volume overloaded with crackles
   and JVD. Pt euvolemic yesterday. BUN/Cr creeping up.
    - I/O goal of -500 cc today
    - cont PO Lasix (did not tolerate IV) as needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have three-vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization.

The patient's current medical conditions include atrial fibrillation (AFib), possible post-myocardial infarction inflammation causing pericarditis, urinary tract infection (UTI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and melanoma. The patient is also diagnosed with dementia and depression, and is currently taking Donepezil, Wellbutrin, and Methylphenidate.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating ongoing myocardial injury. There are also elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine (Cr) ratio, suggesting possible infection or kidney dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and 3VD, there is a high risk of recurrent myocardial ischemia, unstable angina, or further myocardial infarction. The patient's ejection fraction (LVEF) is mildly reduced at"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. She underwent stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA) approximately 10 years ago. The patient's cardiac catheterization showed diffuse 3VD, and cardiac surgery was consulted, stating that she is a poor surgical candidate. The patient declined surgical intervention. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) yesterday showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%. The patient complains of recurrent unstable angina with positive changes in the electrocardiogram (EKG), consistent with ongoing ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk for future cardiac events such as angina, myocardial infarction, and heart failure.
2. 3VD: The patient has diffuse 3VD, which indicates significant coronary artery disease and increases the risk of recurrent myocardial ischemia, unstable angina, and future myocardial infarctions.
3. NSTEMI: The patient presented with NSTEMI, indicating ongoing myocardial ischemia and potential damage to the heart muscle.
4. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of elevated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. The patient has undergone stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA) approximately 10 years ago. 

The patient's current conditions include atrial fibrillation (AF), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), melanoma, dementia, and myocardial infarction. The patient's EKG shows multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and the TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. There is also mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient's ejection fraction (LVEF) is 45%. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 110/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, white blood cell count, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 87 yo female with h/o CAD s/p stent to RCA who
   presented from OSH with NSTEMI and was found to have 3VD via cardiac
   cath.
   .
   # Chest pain: patient describes pleuritic pain and has a pericardial
   rub on exam.  Possible post-MI inflammation causing pericarditis vs.
   infectious pericarditis.  Raises possibility that initial event was
   also secondary to pericarditis, though this seems less likely.
   - Avoid NSAIDs in peri-infarction period. Treat with symptomatic pain
   relief.
   .
   # UTI: Had a positive UA yesterday, diaphoretic on exam today, and has
   a rising WBC.  Started on ciprofloxacin, though she may be worsening on
   current PO antibiotic therapy.  Switch to IV ciprofloxacin and consider
   broadening.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures.
   - monitor closely.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p stent to RCA
   approximately 10 yo at [**Hospital 1534**] Hospital.  The patient presented with
   chest pain in the setting of CE elevation, consistent with NSTEMI.
   Cardiac cath showed diffuse 3VD.  CTSurg was consulted, and they stated
   that the patient is a poor surgical candidate. Pt also declines
   surgical intervention. TTE yesterday showed LVEF 45% and pt c/o
   recurrent unstable angina ON w/ + CE (pleritic vs cardiac)
    - Re-evaluate RCA stent placement v. aggressive medical management
   - SL NTG Morphine for CP; CXR this AM to evaluate pleuritic vs. cardiac
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA 325 mg daily, Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   and uptitrate as tolerated
    - Hold ACEI; currently hypo/normotensive
   - Continue to monitor groin site s/p cath
    - Stop heparin gtt.
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in NSR despite Afib most of yesterday.
   - Continue Amio gtt X 18 hrs, then start 400 mg PO BID tonight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF:  The patient had evidence of elevated LVEDP in
   cardiac cath.  Pt given 250NC bolus yesterday for Afib, then Lasix for
   decreased U/O. Today continues to be volume overloaded with crackles
   and JVD. Pt euvolemic yesterday. BUN/Cr creeping up.
    - I/O goal of -500 cc today
    - cont PO Lasix (did not tolerate IV) as needed
   .
   #. Melanoma:  The patient was recently diagnosed with melanoma and is
   now s/p excision of right inguinal lymph nodes.  She has had all of her
   care at [**Hospital3 1492**].
    - Acquire records from [**Hospital3 1492**], if necessary
   .
   #. Dementia:  Continue home dose of Donepezil
   .
   #. Psych:  Continue home dose of Wellbutrin for depression and
   Methylphenidate for ADD
   .
   #. FEN: Cardiac/Heart Healthy diet

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has been diagnosed with triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization and underwent stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to recurrent unstable angina and chest pain.

The patient's current medications include Plavix, Atorvastatin, aspirin, metoprolol, and amiodarone. She is also receiving IV ciprofloxacin for a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's recent lab results show elevated levels of cardiac enzymes, including troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Her white blood cell count is also elevated, consistent with infection.

The patient's physical examination reveals diaphoresis, mild confusion, and a pericardial rub on examination. She has a fever and is experiencing pleuritic chest pain.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain is likely secondary to pericarditis or post-myocardial infarction inflammation. Pain relief can be achieved with symptomatic treatment.
2. UTI: The patient's positive urine analysis, rising white blood cell count, and symptoms suggest a urinary tract infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be initiated, and follow-up"

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and underwent stent placement in the RCA approximately 10 years ago. She presented with chest pain in the setting of chest elevation, consistent with NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed diffuse 3VD. Cardiac surgery was consulted, and they determined that the patient is a poor surgical candidate. The patient declined surgical intervention. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%, and the patient complained of recurrent unstable angina on admission with positive chest X-ray findings suggestive of pleuritic versus cardiac etiology.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 87 yo female with h/o CAD s/p stent to RCA who
   presented from OSH with NSTEMI and was found to have 3VD via cardiac
   cath.
   .
   # Chest pain: patient describes pleuritic pain and has a pericardial
   rub on exam.  Possible post-MI inflammation causing pericarditis vs.
   infectious pericarditis.  Raises possibility that initial event was
   also secondary to pericarditis, though this seems less likely.
   - Avoid NSAIDs in peri-infarction period. Treat with symptomatic pain
   relief.
   .
   # UTI: Had a positive UA yesterday, diaphoretic on exam today, and has
   a rising WBC.  Started on ciprofloxacin, though she may be worsening on
   current PO antibiotic therapy.  Switch to IV ciprofloxacin and consider
   broadening.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures.
   - monitor closely.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p stent to RCA
   approximately 10 yo at [**Hospital 1534**] Hospital.  The patient presented with
   chest pain in the setting of CE elevation, consistent with NSTEMI.
   Cardiac cath showed diffuse 3VD.  CTSurg was consulted, and they stated
   that the patient is a poor surgical candidate. Pt also declines
   surgical intervention. TTE yesterday showed LVEF 45% and pt c/o
   recurrent unstable angina ON w/ + CE (pleritic vs cardiac)
    - Re-evaluate RCA stent placement v. aggressive medical management
   - SL NTG Morphine for CP; CXR this AM to evaluate pleuritic vs. cardiac
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA 325 mg daily, Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   and uptitrate as tolerated
    - Hold ACEI; currently hypo/normotensive
   - Continue to monitor groin site s/p cath
    - Stop heparin gtt.
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in NSR despite Afib most of yesterday.
   - Continue Amio gtt X 18 hrs, then start 400 mg PO BID tonight
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF: Acute on chronic. The patient had evidence of
   elevated LVEDP in cardiac cath.  Given . Pt euvolemic yesterday. BUN/Cr
   creeping up.
    - I/O goal of -500 cc today
    - cont PO Lasix (did not tolerate IV) as needed
   .
   #. Melanoma:  The patient was recently diagnosed with melanoma and is
   now s/p excision of right inguinal lymph nodes.  She has had all of her
   care at [**Hospital3 1492**].
    - Acquire records from [**Hospital3 1492**], if necessary

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's current condition includes pericarditis, urinary tract infection (UTI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of melanoma. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with dementia and depression. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and 3VD, there is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.
2. Infection: The patient has a UTI and is showing signs of worsening despite being on oral antibiotics. There is a potential for the infection to progress and cause sepsis.
3. Respiratory complications: Due to the patient's age and possible fluid overload, there is a risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia.
4. Bleeding: The patient has undergone recent invasive procedures, including cardiac catheterization and PCI, which increases the risk of bleeding complications"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with NSTEMI and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) but is a poor surgical candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient's current condition includes urinary tract infection (UTI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and melanoma. She is also experiencing mild confusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture for Escherichia coli, indicating a urinary tract infection. If left untreated, it can lead to kidney infection or sepsis.
2. CHF: The patient's symptoms of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and crackles on examination suggest diastolic CHF. If not managed properly, it can result in pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been in and out of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. If not controlled, it can lead to stroke due to the formation of blood clots in the heart.
4. Melanoma: The patient has recently been diagnosed with melanoma and had excision of right inguinal lymph nodes. Close monitoring for metastasis and recurrence is essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent myocardial infarction (MI). She presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) and was found to have three-vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. The patient underwent stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA) and is currently in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had a positive urine analysis (UA) with Escherichia coli (E. coli) growth exceeding 100,000 organisms per milliliter. She was started on oral ciprofloxacin, which was later switched to intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone due to suspected antibiotic resistance. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and antibiotic therapy will be tailored accordingly.
2. Chest pain and pericardial rub: The patient described pleuritic pain and had a pericardial rub on examination. Both symptoms have since resolved. This may be indicative of post-myocardial infarction inflammation or infectious pericarditis.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which includes a previous stent placement in the RCA. She presented with chest pain and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed diffuse 3"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with NSTEMI and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. She has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and has a stent placed in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring due to multiple comorbidities and complications.

24-hour events:
- Antibiotics were switched to intravenous ceftriaxone.
- The patient received a dose of intravenous ciprofloxacin.
- Heparin infusion was stopped.
- Several fluid boluses were administered while the patient appeared mildly septic, but urine output did not improve and blood pressures remained low. Lasix gtt was started at 6:30pm with a goal of -600ccs.
- Low urine output during the day, with a fractional excretion of urea (FE Urea) of 9.23%, suggesting a prerenal etiology.
- Amiodarone gtt was stopped at 8pm, and then given as 400mg orally at [**Hospital1 **] PO for one week, followed by 400mg QD for one week, and then 200mg QD for a total of one month.
- At 11pm, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 80-90s, which"

   # Chest pain: patient described pleuritic pain and has a pericardial
   rub on exam, both now resolved.  Possible post-MI inflammation causing
   pericarditis vs. infectious pericarditis.
   - Cont to avoid NSAIDs in peri-infarction period.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p stent to RCA
   approximately 10 yo at [**Hospital 1534**] Hospital.  The patient presented with
   chest pain and CE elevation, c/w NSTEMI.  Cardiac cath showed diffuse
   3VD.  CTSurg was consulted, patient is a poor surgical candidate. TTE
   showed LVEF 45% .
   - Leaning towards aggressive medical management vs PCI
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA 325 mg daily, Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   and uptitrate as tolerated
    - Hold ACEI; currently hypo/normotensive
   - Continue to monitor groin site s/p cath

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and had a stent placed in the right coronary artery (RCA).

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had a positive urine analysis (UA) with growth of >100,000 Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is pending sensitivity. She received oral (PO) then intravenous (IV) ciprofloxacin and was switched to IV ceftriaxone overnight due to micro data. Follow-up blood and urine cultures are planned to tailor antibiotic therapy appropriately.

2. Chest pain: The patient described pleuritic pain and had a pericardial rub on examination, both of which have now resolved. This could be due to post-myocardial infarction inflammation causing pericarditis or infectious pericarditis. Avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the peri-infarction period is recommended.

3. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and previously underwent stenting of the RCA. She presented with chest pain and evidence of cardiac enzyme elevation, consistent with NSTEMI. Card"

   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p stent to RCA
   approximately 10 yo at [**Hospital 1534**] Hospital.  The patient presented with
   chest pain and CE elevation, c/w NSTEMI.  Cardiac cath showed diffuse
   3VD.  CTSurg was consulted, patient is a poor surgical candidate. TTE
   showed LVEF 45% .
   - Leaning towards aggressive medical management vs PCI
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA 325 mg daily, Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]

   #. Diastolic CHF: Acute on chronic. The patient had evidence of
   elevated LVEDP in cardiac cath.  Given Pt appears total body balance
   volume overloaded today w/ mild crackles on exam, but intravascularly
   may be hypovolemic given FeNA and elevated BUN/Cr. Cr decreased today
   after Lasix gtt started.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with NSTEMI and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. The patient's medical complications include:

1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture growing >100,000 E. coli organisms/mL. She was initially treated with oral ciprofloxacin and then switched to intravenous ceftriaxone due to antibiotic resistance data. Blood and urine cultures should be followed up, and antibiotics should be tailored accordingly.

2. Chest Pain and Pericarditis: The patient described pleuritic pain, and a pericardial rub was detected on examination, which has since resolved. Possible causes include post-myocardial infarction inflammation causing pericarditis or infectious pericarditis. NSAIDs should be avoided in the peri-infarction period.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and underwent stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA) about 10 years ago. She presented with chest pain and evidence of acute coronary syndrome, consistent with NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization showed diffuse 3VD. Coronary artery bypass surgery (CTSurg) was consulted, but the patient is a poor surgical candidate. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%. Aggressive medical management versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is being considered. The patient is currently on Plavix, Atorvastatin, aspirin (ASA) 325 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg, and will be uptitrated as tolerated. ACE inhibitors should be held due to hypotension.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has been in and out of AF with rates up to 100 beats per minute. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm. Amiodarone 400 mg per oral twice a day for one week, then 200 mg per day, will be continued. Telemetry monitoring will be continued.

5. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in cardiac catheterization and appears to have acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF. The patient is volume overloaded with mild crackles on examination but may be hypovolemic intravascularly, as indicated by fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr) levels. Lasix infusion should be continued, and the goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of -500 mL today. Titration of Lasix up as tolerated should be done.

6. Melanoma: The patient was recently diagnosed with melanoma and underwent excision of right inguinal lymph nodes. Records from the previous hospital where she received care should be acquired.

7. Dementia: The patient's home dose of donepezil for dementia should be continued.

8. Psychiatric Conditions: The patient's home doses"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and had a stent placed in the right coronary artery (RCA).

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Systolic/Diastolic CHF: The patient has evidence of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) during cardiac catheterization and continues to have mild crackles on examination, indicating possible acute-on-chronic heart failure. The patient's total body balance volume is still overloaded, and she may be hypovolemic given the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNA) on 7/31 and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr). The creatinine level has been increasing daily, possibly related to antibiotic use or starting furosemide (Lasix) gtt. The goal is to achieve an even-negative fluid balance of 500cc today and adjust Lasix gtt to keep it even while closely monitoring creatinine and urine output (UOP).

2. UTI: The patient had a positive urine analysis (UA), and cultures grew more than 100,000 Escherichia coli ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have three-vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. The patient has undergone stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA) and has been treated with medical management for CAD.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, which is pansensitive to antibiotics. She has been receiving oral and then intravenous ciprofloxacin, switched to ceftriaxone overnight due to hospital-specific microbiology data, and then switched back to oral ciprofloxacin for a five-day course.

Additionally, the patient has evidence of acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), melanoma, dementia, and myocardial infarction. The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and is being managed with amiodarone for AFib.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving cardiac, heart-healthy nutrition with poor oral intake yesterday. Glycemic control is being monitored, and arterial and PICC lines have been placed. Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pain management with Tylenol and morphine as needed, bowel care with s"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have three-vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. The patient also has a recent diagnosis of melanoma and is post-excision of right inguinal lymph nodes. Additionally, the patient has a history of dementia, depression, and attention deficit disorder (ADD).

The patient's current medical issues include urinary tract infection (UTI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), melanoma, dementia, and myocardial infarction. 

In the ICU, the patient is being managed for these conditions. The plan includes antibiotic therapy for the UTI, cardiac medications for CAD, antiarrhythmic medication for AFib, diuretics for CHF, and pain management. The patient is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation therapy due to her high risk for stroke.

The patient's recent lab results indicate an elevated creatinine level, suggesting possible acute kidney injury. Fluid balance and electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, and further evaluation is needed to determine if the elevated creatinine is due to pre-renal causes or acute interstitial nephritis.

Overall, the patient's medical complications and ongoing management in the ICU involve UTI, CHF, AFib, and myocard"

s, slight
   drop in BP but asymptomatic. Last recurrence was 11pm on [**7-31**], received
   Lopressor and returned to NSR at 5 am. Currently in NSR.
   - Continue Amio 400 mg PO BID for 1 week, then 200 mg [**Hospital1 **], then 200 mg
   daily
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Given CHADS score of 3, pt at sufficient risk for stroke (~5%);
   started heparin gtt w/ bridge to Coumadin 2.5mg yesterday. Continue to
   monitor INR

   # Chest pain: patient described pleuritic pain and has a pericardial
   rub on exam on [**2166-7-31**], both now resolved.  Possible post-MI
   inflammation causing pericarditis vs. infectious pericarditis.
   - Cont to avoid NSAIDs in peri-infarction period. Just pain control for
   now
 none needed since yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with NSTEMI and was found to have triple vessel disease via cardiac catheterization. She has multiple medical conditions including systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure, urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation, melanoma, dementia, and depression. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Systolic/Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's CHF is acute on chronic and is being managed with diuretics (Lasix) to achieve a goal of negative 500cc fluid balance. Close monitoring of creatinine and urine output will be necessary to assess renal function and avoid further deterioration.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had a positive urine culture indicating an infection caused by E. coli, which is pansensitive. She has been started on PO ciprofloxacin for a 5-day course. Blood cultures will be followed up to tailor antibiotic therapy appropriately.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has had episodes of AFIB with rates up to 100 beats per minute. She has been started on amiodarone 400 mg PO BID for 1 week, then 200 mg daily. Telemetry monitoring will continue to monitor the patient's heart rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 87 yo female with h/o CAD s/p stent to RCA who
   presented from OSH with NSTEMI and was found to have 3VD via cardiac
   cath.
   .
   #. Systolic/Diastolic CHF: Acute on chronic. The patient had evidence
   of elevated LVEDP in cardiac cath.  Given Pt appears total body balance
   volume still overloaded today w/ mild crackles on exam, but
   intravascularly may be hypovolemic given FeNA on [**7-31**] and elevated
   BUN/Cr. Cr started to increase when Abx started, continued to increase
   after Lasix gtt started.
   -         I/O goal of even-neg 500cc today; adjust Lasix gtt to keep
   even
 will monitor Cr/UOP closely today
   -         ULytes, Eos, UA pending for pre-renal vs. Acute Interstitial
   Nephritis [**3-3**] Abx
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Cr has been increasing daily (baseline 1.0, now 2.0 today), may
   be related to abx vs. starting Lasix gtt. [**Month (only) 11**] be multifactorial,
   doesn
t seem completely pre-renal. F/u urine studies as above.
   .
   # UTI: Had a positive UA, cx grew >100,000 E. coli, pansensitive.
   Received PO then IV ciprofloxacin, switched to CTX O/N due to [**Hospital1 1**]
   micro data then switched back to PO cipro (renal dosing) for 5 day
   course (complicated UTI). WBC now trending down, afebrile since AM [**7-31**].
   - day [**4-5**] of abx
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - monitor fever curve
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p stent to RCA
   approximately 10 yo at [**Hospital 1534**] Hospital.  The patient presented with
   chest pain and CE elevation, c/w NSTEMI.  Cardiac cath showed diffuse
   3VD.  CTSurg was consulted, patient is a poor surgical candidate. TTE
   showed LVEF 45% .
   - [**Hospital 7092**] medical management vs PCI
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA 325 mg daily, Metoprolol 12.5 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and uptitrate as tolerated
    - Hold ACEI; currently hypo/normotensive
   - Continue to monitor BPs w/ ALine
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient has been in and out of Afib with rates 100
s, slight
   drop in BP but asymptomatic. Last recurrence was 11pm on [**7-31**], received
   Lopressor and returned to NSR at 5 am. Currently in NSR.
   - Decrease Amio to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **], then 200 mg daily after 1 week.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Given CHADS score of 3, pt at sufficient risk for stroke (~5%);
   started heparin gtt w/ bridge to Coumadin 2.5mg yesterday. Continue to
   monitor INR
   .
   # Chest pain: patient described pleuritic pain and has a pericardial
   rub on exam on [**2166-7-31**], both now resolved.  Possible post-MI
   inflammation causing pericarditis vs. infectious pericarditis.
   - Cont to avoid NSAIDs in peri-infarction period. Just pain control for
   now
 none needed since [**7-31**].
   .
   #. Melanoma:  The patient was recently diagnosed with melanoma and is
   now s/p excision of right inguinal lymph nodes.  She has had all of her
   care at [**Hospital3 1492**].
    - Acquire records from [**Hospital3 1492**], if necessary
   .
   #. Dementia:  Continue home dose of Donepezil
   .
   #. Psych:  Continue home dose of Wellbutrin for depression and
   Methylphenidate for ADD
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Cardiac, heart healthy; Poor PO intake yesterday

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 87 yo female with h/o CAD s/p stent to RCA who
   presented from OSH with NSTEMI and was found to have 3VD via cardiac
   cath.
   .
   #. Systolic/Diastolic CHF: Acute on chronic. The patient had evidence
   of elevated LVEDP in cardiac cath.  Given Pt appears mildly fluid
   overloaded with bilateral crackles on lung exam, will attempt to
   maintain slightly negative, though we are limited by her kidney
   function.
   -          I/O goal of -500cc today; adjust Lasix gtt to keep even
   will monitor Cr/UOP closely.
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Cr has been increasing steadily (baseline 1.0, now 2.1 today),
   may be related to abx vs. starting Lasix gtt. [**Month (only) 11**] be multifactorial,
   doesn
t seem completely pre-renal.  FE Urea 48%, suggesting that rising
   creatinine is not simply pre-renal, but multifactorial.  Urine eos
   negative and UA is now negative.
   .
   # UTI: Had a positive UA, cx grew >100,000 E. coli, pansensitive.
   Received PO then IV ciprofloxacin, switched to CTX O/N due to [**Hospital1 1**]
   micro data then switched back to PO cipro (renal dosing). WBC now
   trending down, afebrile since AM [**7-31**].
   - day [**5-6**] of abx
   - follow-up blood cultures x3
   - monitor fever curve
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p stent to RCA
   approximately 10 yo at [**Hospital 1534**] Hospital.  The patient presented with
   chest pain and CE elevation, c/w NSTEMI.  Cardiac cath showed diffuse
   3VD.  CTSurg was consulted, patient is a poor surgical candidate. TTE
   showed LVEF 45%.  Plan is aggressive medical management.
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA 325 mg daily, Metoprolol 12.5 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and uptitrate as tolerated
    - Holding ACEI in setting of acute kidney injury
   - Continue to monitor BPs w/ ALine
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient has been in and out of Afib with rates 90-100
s, no
   change in blood pressure. Last recurrence was 8pm to midnight [**8-2**],
   converted spontaneously. Currently in NSR.
   - Decrease Amio to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **], then 200 mg daily after 1 week.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Given CHADS score of 3, pt at sufficient risk for stroke (~5%);
   started heparin gtt w/ bridge to Coumadin 2.5mg yesterday.  INR remains
   subtherapeutic.
   .
   # Chest pain: patient described pleuritic pain and has a pericardial
   rub on exam on [**2166-7-31**], both now resolved.  Possible post-MI
   inflammation causing pericarditis vs. infectious pericarditis.
   - Cont to avoid NSAIDs in peri-infarction period. Just pain control for
   now
 none needed since [**7-31**].
   .
   #. Melanoma:  The patient was recently diagnosed with melanoma and is
   now s/p excision of right inguinal lymph nodes.  She has had all of her
   care at [**Hospital3 1492**].
   .
   #. Dementia:  Less oriented today, but remains attentive.  Very high
   risk for delirium.  Continue home dose of Donepezil
   .
   #. Psych:  Continue home dose of Wellbutrin for depression and
   Methylphenidate for ADD
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Regular heart healthy diet, patient complaining of poor

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and recent stent placement in the right coronary artery. She presented to the hospital with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have three-vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization. The patient has been diagnosed with acute-on-chronic systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and renal dysfunction. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) that has been treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient is currently on aggressive medical management for coronary artery disease (CAD), including medications such as Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA, Metoprolol, and holding ACE inhibitors due to acute kidney injury. She has experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation (Afib) but is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient has a history of melanoma with excision of right inguinal lymph nodes and dementia. She is also being treated for depression and attention deficit disorder (ADD) with Wellbutrin and methylphenidate, respectively. The patient's daughter and son are available for communication. The patient's disposition is discussed.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 87 yo female with h/o CAD s/p stent to RCA who
   presented from OSH with NSTEMI and was found to have 3VD via cardiac
   cath.
   .
   #. Systolic/Diastolic CHF: Acute on chronic. The patient had evidence
   of elevated LVEDP in cardiac cath.  Given Pt appears mildly fluid
   overloaded with bilateral crackles on lung exam, will attempt to
   maintain slightly negative, though we are limited by her kidney
   function.
   - doing well with O2 sat 97 on RA
   - I/O goal of even today, D/Ced Lasix gtt yesterday, hold off for today
   - monitor Cr/UOP closely.
   .
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Cr had been increasing steadily (baseline 1.0, now 2.1 today),
   may be related to contrast vs. abx vs. Lasix gtt. FE Urea 48%,
   suggesting that rising creatinine is not simply pre-renal, but
   multifactorial.
   - Urine eos negative and UA negative.
   - hold Lasix for today, follow Cr
   .
   # UTI: Had a positive UA, cx grew >100,000 E. coli, pansensitive.
   Received PO then IV ciprofloxacin, switched to CTX O/N due to [**Hospital1 1**]
   micro data then switched back to PO cipro (renal dosing). WBC now
   trending down, afebrile since AM [**7-31**].
   - day [**5-6**] of abx
   - follow-up blood cultures x3
   - monitor fever curve
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD s/p stent to RCA
   approximately 10 yo at [**Hospital 1534**] Hospital.  The patient presented with
   chest pain and CE elevation, c/w NSTEMI.  Cardiac cath showed diffuse
   3VD.  CTSurg was consulted, patient is a poor surgical candidate. TTE
   showed LVEF 45%.  Plan is aggressive medical management.
   - Continue Plavix, Atorvastatin, ASA 325 mg daily, Metoprolol 12.5 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] and uptitrate as tolerated
    - Holding ACEI in setting of acute kidney injury
   - D/C arterial line today
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient has been in and out of Afib with rates 90-100
s, no
   change in blood pressure. Last recurrence was 8pm to midnight [**8-2**],
   converted spontaneously. Currently in NSR.
   - Cont Amio to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **], then 200 mg daily after 1 week.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Given CHADS score of 3, pt at sufficient risk for stroke (~5%);
   started heparin gtt w/ bridge to Coumadin 2.5mg yesterday.  INR remains
   subtherapeutic.
   .
   # Chest pain: patient described pleuritic pain and has a pericardial
   rub on exam on [**2166-7-31**], both now resolved.  Possible post-MI
   inflammation causing pericarditis vs. infectious pericarditis.
   - Cont to avoid NSAIDs in peri-infarction period. Just pain control for
   now
 none needed since [**7-31**].
   .
   #. Melanoma:  The patient was recently diagnosed with melanoma and is
   now s/p excision of right inguinal lymph nodes.  She has had all of her
   care at [**Hospital3 1492**].
   .
   #. Dementia:  Less oriented today, but remains attentive.  Very high
   risk for delirium.  Continue home dose of Donepezil
   .
   #. Psych:  Continue home dose of Wellbutrin for depression and
   Methylphenidate for ADD

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the right coronary artery (RCA). She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) via cardiac catheterization.

The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic systolic/diastolic heart failure (CHF), urinary tract infection (UTI), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). She has been treated with multiple antibiotics for the UTI and is currently on renal dosing of ciprofloxacin. Her creatinine level has been increasing steadily from 1.0 to 2.3, suggesting possible contrast-induced nephropathy or antibiotic-induced nephropathy.

The patient also has a history of dementia, depression, and attention deficit disorder (ADD), for which she is receiving Donepezil, Wellbutrin, and Methylphenidate, respectively. She is a poor oral intake and is being fed through Ensure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic CHF: The patient has evidence of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) during cardiac catheterization and shows signs of fluid overload with bilateral crackles on lung exam. It is important to monitor her fluid balance closely.
2. Increasing creatinine levels: The patient's rising creat"
