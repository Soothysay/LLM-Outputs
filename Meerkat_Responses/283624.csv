   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of
   hypertension, diastolic CHF who presents with new onset tachyarrhythmia
   with long conversion pauses.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Unclear if this is a.fib/flutter with abberancy vs.
   another SVT. Long conversion pauses concerning tachy-brady syndrome.
   Currently hemodynamically stable. No signs of ischemic cause, likely
   age related conduction degradation in setting of dCHF. However, stable
   now in bigeminy.
   - if becomes fast again and unstable, will float temporary pacer wire
   to manage pauses/bradycardia
   - pacer pads in place
   - rate control with 25mg PO metoprolol TID
   - will likely need permanent pacemaker
   - heparin gtt for prophylaxis, will bridge to coumadin after pacemaker
   .
   # PUMP: History of very well controlled dCHF on no diuretics. No signs
   of decompensation at this time.
   - BB as above
   - Will hold lisinopril given concern for relative hypotension if heart
   rhythm destabilizes. If hypertensive, can restart.
   .
   # Coronaries: No signs of ischemia currently. CEZ neg. No ischemic
   changes on EKG.
   -Con't ASA 81, simvastatin, metoprolol
   .
   # HTN:
   - Hold amlodipine and lisinopril until HR stable
   - Increase metoprolol as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She presents with new-onset tachyarrhythmia, likely atrial fibrillation or flutter with aberrancy. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but has long conversion pauses, concerning tachy-brady syndrome. She is being managed with rate control using metoprolol and is planned for a permanent pacemaker. Her pump function is well-controlled on no diuretics, and there are no signs of decompensation. She has a history of very well-controlled dCHF, and no signs of ischemia are currently observed. The patient's other medical conditions include depression, osteoarthritis, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, and hyperglycemia. She is currently in the ICU and will be transferred to the CCU for further management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and diastolic congestive heart failure. She presents with new onset tachyarrhythmia, possibly atrial fibrillation or flutter with aberrancy, or another supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and there are no signs of ischemic cause. The most likely cause of her condition is age-related conduction degradation in the setting of diastolic CHF. She experienced atrial bigeminy but is now in normal sinus rhythm (NSR). 

The patient has a history of very well-controlled diastolic CHF on no diuretics and shows no signs of decompensation at this time. She has no signs of ischemia currently, and there are no ischemic changes on her EKG. Her blood pressure is controlled with metoprolol, and she will restart her home lisinopril 10mg daily. 

Other medical conditions include depression, osteoarthritis, and insomnia. She is advised to follow a heart-healthy diet and is NPO after midnight for a potential pacemaker procedure tomorrow. 

The patient has PIV's and an R IJ cordis for access. Prophylaxis includes DVT ppx with heparin gtt, which will be discontinued at 4 AM tomorrow in preparation for pacer placement. Pain management with Tylenol and a bowel regimen are also"

   # Tachycardia: Unclear if this is a.fib/flutter with abberancy vs.
   another SVT. Long conversion pauses concerning tachy-brady syndrome.
   Currently hemodynamically stable. No signs of ischemic cause, likely
   age related conduction degradation in setting of dCHF. Went into atrial
   bigeminy, and now in NSR overnight.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with new-onset tachyarrhythmia and long conversion pauses. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with no signs of ischemic cause. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR) with a heart rate of 73 bpm. The patient's blood pressure is 162/87 mmHg and the oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient has been on various medications including lisinopril, metoprolol, ASA, simvastatin, and coumadin. The patient also has a colostomy bag in place.

The patient's laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and potassium levels. The troponin-T level is below 0.01, indicating no signs of myocardial infarction. The PT/PTT/INR levels are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of tachyarrhythmia with rate control using metoprolol and consideration for a temporary pacemaker if the patient becomes fast again and unstable. The patient is also being evaluated for permanent pacemaker placement due to likely age-related conduction degradation in the setting of dCHF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and diastolic congestive heart failure. She presented with new onset tachyarrhythmia with long conversion pauses, which is concerning for tachy-brady syndrome. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and shows no signs of ischemic cause. The likely cause is age-related conduction degradation in the setting of dCHF. The patient experienced episodes of atrial bigeminy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, but is now in normal sinus rhythm. 

The plan is to place a temporary pacemaker wire if the patient becomes fast again and unstable. Permanent pacemaker placement will be done today. Rate control will be managed with metoprolol, and anticoagulation with heparin will be used for prophylaxis, bridging to coumadin after pacemaker placement.

The patient's pump function is well-controlled dCHF, with no signs of decompensation. She will continue on her home medications, including lisinopril, and may restart amlodipine later in the day if her blood pressure requires or tolerates it, following electrophysiology recommendations.

There are no signs of coronary artery disease or ischemia, so the patient will continue on aspirin, simvastatin, and metoprolol.

Her hypertension will be managed with the restart of home lisinopril and holding aml"
