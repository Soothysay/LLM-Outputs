   Assessment and Plan
   56 year-old female with a history of type 2 DM, ESRD on PD who
   initially presented with pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia, with
   progression of pulmonary findings on CT and placement of a chest tube,
   transferred to the MICU with relative hypotension.
   # Pneumonia with left-sided effusion: Patient was initially treated
   with levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia.  2/2 blood cultures
   from [**11-28**] on admission grew MSSA, and patient was started on
   nafcillin.  Chest x-ray showed persistent effusion -> chest CT [**12-3**]
   showed a cavitary lesion in left lower lobe and a fluid collection,
   concerning for pulmonary abscess/bronchopleural fistula.
   Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter and subsequently a
   chest tube [**12-4**].  Pleural studies pending but indicative of an
   exudate, with gram stain showing GPC.  Influenza negative on
   admission.  Sputum cultures pending.
   - Continue nafcillin, levofloxacin -> add zosyn for improved gram
   negative coverage given relative hypotension

   - AFB x 1 [**12-4**]; needs two additional induced sputum
   - Continue standing nebulizers, tessalon perles, guaifenesin with
   codeine, and morphine as needed for cough
   # Relative hypotension: Improved on transfer after 500cc NS.  Unclear
   etiology
 may be due to infection versus hypovolemia.  Patient did not
   have tension pneumothorax.
   - Continue nafcillin, levofloxacin -> add zosyn for improved coverage
   given relative hypotension
   - Goal even for PD today
   - Hold metoprolol
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: Patient with pneumonia and empyema as
   above.  MSSA bacteremia from admission.  No other obvious sources - PD
   fluid negative for infection, C. difficile negative x 1.
   - Continue nafcillin, levofloxacin -> add zosyn given relative
   hypotension
   - Follow blood, sputum, pleural, stool cultures
   - Consider TTE to evaluate for endocarditis
   # Bacteremia: 2/2 blood cultures from admission MSSA [**11-28**] from
   admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] be related to pulmonary infection.  No other obvious
   source - no skin breaks, recent dental procedures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented initially with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. The patient was transferred to the MICU with relative hypotension. She has been treated with levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia and nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia. Chest x-ray showed persistent effusion, and a subsequent chest CT revealed a cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe and a fluid collection, concerning for pulmonary abscess/bronchopleural fistula. A pigtail catheter and chest tube were placed by Interventional Pulmonary. Pleural studies are pending but indicative of an exudate, with gram stain showing Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Influenza was negative on admission. Sputum cultures are pending.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia with left-sided effusion: The patient initially presented with pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia. Despite treatment, the patient developed a cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe and a fluid collection, indicating a possible progression to pulmonary abscess or bronchopleural fistula.
2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient had positive blood cultures from admission growing MSSA. She was started on n"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 year-old female with a history of type 2 DM, ESRD on PD who
   initially presented with pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia, with
   progression of pulmonary findings on CT and placement of a chest tube,
   transferred to the MICU with relative hypotension.
   # Pneumonia with left-sided effusion: Patient was initially treated
   with levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia.  2/2 blood cultures
   from [**11-28**] on admission grew MSSA, and patient was started on
   nafcillin.  Chest x-ray showed persistent effusion -> chest CT [**12-3**]
   showed a cavitary lesion in left lower lobe and a fluid collection,
   concerning for pulmonary abscess/bronchopleural fistula.
   Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter and subsequently a
   chest tube [**12-4**].  Pleural studies pending but indicative of an
   exudate.  Influenza negative on admission.  Sputum cultures pending.

   - Continue standing nebulizers, tessalon perles, guaifenesin with
   codeine, and morphine as needed for cough
   # Relative hypotension: Improved on transfer after 500cc NS.  Unclear
   etiology
 may be due to infection versus hypovolemia.  Patient did not
   have tension pneumothorax.
   - Continue nafcillin, levofloxacin -> add zosyn for improved coverage
   given relative hypotension
   - Goal even for PD today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She initially presented with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. The patient's condition progressed, leading to the placement of a chest tube due to a left-sided effusion. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with relative hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/54 to 145/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, clear breath sounds with symmetric chest expansion, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows attentiveness, purposeful movements, and normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.0 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 21.0 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 553 K/uL, increased creatinine level of 13.3 mg/dL, elevated glucose level of 288 mg/dL, and abnormal electrolyte levels including"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 year old woman with PMH as above who presents with MSSA pneumonia
   now c/b empeyema. S/P chest tube but with minimal drainage so plan
   to go to the OR today for evacuation. On nafcillin, okay with zosyn for
   now. Ruling out for TB, but overwhelmingly most likely pathogen is
   MSSA.
   hemodynamics have normalized with minimal fluid resuscitaion. Will
   restart BB perioperatively. Renal following for PD.  Further plans as
   per resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the emergency department with fever, pleuritic chest pain, and cough. A left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray was noted, and she was admitted to the medical ICU. She was treated with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone for MSSA pneumonia. However, she developed a new leukocytosis, and a chest CT revealed a left lower lobe cavitary lesion, possible bronchopulmonary fistula, and empyema. She underwent chest tube placement with gram-positive cocci on pleural fluid gram stain. On the night of transfer, she experienced fluid-responsive hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s and was transferred back to the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MSSA Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with MSSA pneumonia, which required treatment with antibiotics. However, the development of leukocytosis and empyema suggests that the infection may not be fully controlled.
2. Bronchopulmonary Fistula (BPF): The presence of a cavitary lesion and possible BPF increases the risk of persistent infection and the need for surgical intervention.
3. Empyema: The patient has developed empyema, which is an accumulation of infected fluid in the pleural space. This can"

 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, EMPYEMA
   56 year-old female with a history of type 2 DM, ESRD on PD who
   initially presented with pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia, with
   progression of pulmonary findings on CT and placement of a chest tube,
   transferred to the MICU with relative hypotension.
   # Pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula: [**1-21**]
   blood cultures from [**11-28**] on admission grew MSSA, and patient was
   started on nafcillin.  Patient was initially treated with levofloxacin
   for community-acquired pneumonia.  Interventional Pulmonary placed a
   pigtail catheter and subsequently a chest tube [**12-4**].  Pleural and
   sputum studies pending but indicative of an exudate, with gram stain
   showing GPC.  Influenza negative on admission.  Unlikely TB, but will
   continue rule-out.
   - Continue nafcillin and start flagyl for anaerobic coverage;
   discontinue zosyn and levofloxacin
   - Thoracics following and plan for OR today for decortication and
   placement of larger chest tube
   - Follow blood, sputum, pleural fluid studies
   - IP following; appreciate
   - PPD placed [**2158-12-4**] (negative in [**2155**] per OMR)
   - AFB x 1 [**12-4**]; needs two additional induced sputum
   - Continue standing nebulizers, tessalon perles, guaifenesin with
   codeine, and morphine as needed for cough
   # Relative hypotension: Fluid responsive.  Patient did not have tension
   pneumothorax.
   - Goal even for PD today
   - Restart low-dose metoprolol
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: Patient with pneumonia and empyema as
   above, presumed MSSA given MSSA bacteremia from admission.  No other
   obvious sources - PD fluid negative for infection, C. difficile
   negative x 1.
   - Continue nafcillin and start flagyl for anaerobic coverage;
   discontinue zosyn and levofloxacin
   - Follow blood, sputum, pleural, stool cultures
   # MSSA bacteremia: 2/2 blood cultures from [**11-28**] on admission.  Likely
   due to pulmonary infection as above.  Surveillance cultures negative.
   - Continue nafcillin for a 14-day course
   # ESRD on PD: [**Name (NI) 552**] husband performing PD per her home regimen.
   - Renal aware
   - PD tonight
 goal even
   - Continue nephrocaps, sevelamer and lanthanum
   - One liter fluid restriction
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to improve PD performance
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Baseline mid-20s; trending down since
   admission.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Continue epo
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfuse today as going to OR
   - Monitor daily
   # Coronary artery disease: Status post bare metal stenting.  No signs
   or symptoms of active ischemia.  EKG unchanged.  Cardiac enzymes at
   baseline on admission.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg daily, statin
   - Restart low-dose metoprolol in the peri-operative period
   - Holding lisinopril given hypotension as above
   # Anion gap: Chronic in the setting of renal failure.  Improved.  Serum
   acetone negative on admission.
   - Monitor
   # Thyroid nodule: Incidentally noted on CT chest.
   - Outpatient evaluation

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presented initially with pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia, which progressed to pulmonary findings on CT and placement of a chest tube. She was transferred to the MICU for hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/56 mmHg to 137/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 27 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.
- The patient has three chest tubes draining, with one pigtail catheter placed.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with elevated blood glucose levels.
- Imaging shows mild improvement in left pleural effusion but still large consolidation/opacity in the left lung.
- Blood cultures from 12/9 grew MSSA, and no positive blood cultures have been observed since then.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She initially presented with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, which progressed to pulmonary findings on CT and required placement of a chest tube. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula. Blood cultures from November 28th on admission grew MSSA, and she has been started on nafcillin. Levofloxacin was discontinued as it was initially prescribed for community-acquired pneumonia. Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter and subsequently a chest tube on December 4th. Pleural and sputum studies are pending but indicative of an exudate, with gram stain showing Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Influenza was negative on admission, and tuberculosis (TB) is unlikely but will continue to be ruled out.

Thoracics were performed after evacuation of empyema and three chest tubes were placed on December 6th. The patient's current treatment plan includes ventilation support with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 year old woman with MSSA pneumonia, bacteremia and empeyema. Now s/p
   OR. BAL showing GPC, just PMN's on gram stain from pleural space but
   cultures pending. Chest tubes draining slowly, will likely need chest
   CT to assess position. Continues on naf and flagyl pending final
   culture data but likely can use naf alone. Currently on CMV with
   minimal PEEP and fi02 will switch to PS today and aim to extubate. More
   recently have been suctioning very thick blood clots and what seemed
   almost like solid tissue. She was apparently a very difficult
   intubation, fiberoptic. I will bronch to evaluate airway and secretions
   prior to extubation.
   Low dose dopamine requirement likely related to sedation and
   hypovolemia. 500 cc NS bolus now and wean dopamine rapidly.
   Continues on peritoneal dialysis.
   Further plans as per resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with MSSA pneumonia, bacteremia, and empyema. She underwent surgery for VATS with decortication and is now in the ICU. She experienced hypotension post-operation and required blood transfusion, fluids, and dopamine to maintain blood pressure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal PEEP and FiO2, and plans to switch to pressure support mode today. The chest tubes are draining slowly, and a chest CT may be needed to assess their position. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, along with elevated liver enzymes, creatinine, glucose, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is sedated and not fully assessed neurologically.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function if the ventilation settings need to be adjusted or if there is an infection.
2. Infection: The patient has MSSA pneumonia and bacteremia, indicating a systemic infection. There is a risk of developing further infections, especially in the ICU setting.
3. Bleeding: The patient received blood transfusions and has an elevated platelet count. There is a risk of bleeding complications due to the use of anticoagulants and the patient's compromised condition.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She initially presented with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. Her condition progressed, leading to the placement of a chest tube due to empyema and bronchopleural fistula. She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula: The patient's initial presentation included pneumonia, which progressed to empyema and bronchopleural fistula. This can lead to persistent lung infection, respiratory distress, and sepsis.
2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient had MSSA bacteremia, likely due to the pulmonary infection. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
3. Hypotension: The patient was admitted with hypotension, which resolved after fluid resuscitation. However, it highlights the need for careful monitoring of hemodynamic status and potential fluid management issues.
4. Diabetes: The patient may be experiencing type 1 DM, as she feels this way and insulin therapy has been initiated. This can lead to complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and diabetic keto"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. She developed empyema and bronchopleural fistula, requiring placement of a chest tube. She also had hypotension and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula: The patient initially presented with pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia, which progressed to empyema and bronchopleural fistula. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and potential need for further surgical intervention.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which required the administration of dopamine. This could be due to septic shock secondary to the MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia. Close monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability.

3. Diabetes: The patient is believed to have type 1 DM, as per the attending physician's recommendation. Insulin therapy is required to maintain glycemic control, and close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

4. ESRD on PD: The patient has ESRD and is currently on PD. Regular exchanges are needed to manage her renal failure. Monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is crucial to prevent complications associated with PD.

5. MSSA bacteremia: The patient had MSSA bacteremia, likely secondary to the pulmonary infection. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy with nafcillin for a complete 14-day course to eradicate the infection.

6. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, with a baseline HCT in the mid-20s. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion criteria are necessary to manage her anemia.

7. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD and underwent bare metal stenting. Close monitoring for signs or symptoms of active ischemia is essential, and medication adjustments may be required.

8. Thyroid nodule: An incidentally noted thyroid nodule was identified on CT chest. Further outpatient evaluation is needed to assess its significance.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems, including respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, and infectious."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She initially presented with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. Her condition progressed, leading to the placement of a chest tube due to a large left consolidation/pleural effusion. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula. She has received various treatments including antibiotics, chest tube placement, and pigtail catheter insertion. The patient's blood cultures from admission grew MSSA, and she has been on nafcillin. Levofloxacin was started for community-acquired pneumonia but has been discontinued. The patient's pleural and sputum studies indicate an exudate with gram-positive cocci (GPC) present. Influenza was negative on admission, and tuberculosis (TB) is unlikely but will continue to be ruled out. The patient's thorax surgery involved evacuation of empyema and placement of three chest tubes. PPD was negative, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative three times. Flagyl was stopped due to successful chest tube placement and no culture data suggesting the need for this antibiotic. The patient's current plan includes a computed tom"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 year old woman with PMH as above. Plan as per resident note.
   Briefly, MSSA pneumonia complicated by empyema. Minimal chest tube
   output today and no cuff leak despite solumedrol. Will check neck and
   chest CT today but I will likely need to wait another day or so and
   then if still no leak, then will extubate (with bronchoscope and
   anesthsia) even without cuff leak. Continue PS 5/5. Further plans as
   per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), Type I diabetes mellitus (DM), and presents with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia complicated by cavitation, bronchopulmonary fistula (BPF), and empyema. She has undergone video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and is still intubated due to lack of cuff leak.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius (100.2 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/60 mmHg to 152/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,798 mL and output of 1,140 mL, resulting in a balance of 658 mL. The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 1 mg/hour and fentanyl at 100 mcg/hour. She is also on lansoprazole (Prevacid) and other ICU medications.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin at 8.1 g/dL, leukocyte count at 384 K/uL,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was initially admitted with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. The patient's condition progressed, and she required placement of a chest tube due to empyema and bronchopleural fistula. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension.

The patient has been treated with nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia, but the latter has been discontinued. She underwent evacuation of empyema and placement of three chest tubes. Her blood cultures showed GPC and influenza negative. She also has a history of CAD, for which she underwent bare metal stenting, but currently shows no signs or symptoms of active ischemia.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with bandemia, likely due to pneumonia and empyema. Her renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. She has anemia with a baseline Hct of mid-20s, but no signs or symptoms of active bleeding. Her anion gap has improved, but she still requires close monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She presented initially with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. Her condition progressed, leading to the placement of a chest tube due to pulmonary findings on CT. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula: The patient's pneumonia has progressed to empyema, which is a collection of pus in the pleural space. The presence of a bronchopleural fistula increases the risk of recurrent infections and complications such as abscess formation.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which resolved after fluid resuscitation. However, close monitoring is required to prevent recurrent episodes.
3. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes status is uncertain, as she feels like she has type 1 DM. Appropriate management of her blood glucose levels is crucial to prevent complications associated with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
4. Leukocytosis with bandemia: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of band cells suggest an ongoing infection, most likely due to MSSA given her bacteremia. Continuous monitoring and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), who initially presented with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. She has progressed to pulmonary findings on CT and required placement of a chest tube. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension. She has since developed empyema and a bronchopleural fistula, and has undergone decortication and additional chest tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula: The patient initially presented with pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia, which progressed to pulmonary findings on CT. She developed empyema and a bronchopleural fistula, requiring chest tube placement and decortication. The patient remains on nafcillin therapy for a likely two-week course.
2. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive but has since resolved. She is now off dopamine for more than 48 hours. The plan includes restarting metoprolol and valsartan, with titration as tolerated.
3. Leukocytosis with bandemia: The patient has leukocytosis with bandemia, likely due to pneumonia and empyema growing MSSA. No other obvious sources of infection have"

   56 year-old female with a history of type 2 DM, ESRD on PD who
   initially presented with pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia, with
   progression of pulmonary findings on CT and placement of a chest tube,
   transferred to the MICU with for hypotension.
   # Pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula: [**1-21**]
   blood cultures from [**11-28**] on admission grew MSSA. On nafcillin.
   Levofloxacin started for community-acquired pneumonia has been
   discontinured.  Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter and
   subsequently a chest tube [**12-4**].  Pleural and sputum studies pending
   but indicative of an exudate, with gram stain showing GPC.  Influenza
   negative on admission.  Unlikely TB, but will continue rule-out.
   Thoracics s/p evacuation empyema and 3 chest tubes placed [**12-6**]. PPD
   negative. AFB negative *3. Stopped flagyl [**12-7**] due successful chest
   tube placement and no culture data to suggest need for this antibiotic.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and coronary artery disease. She presented initially with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. Her condition progressed, leading to the placement of a chest tube due to pulmonary findings on a CT scan.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypotension. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula. Blood cultures from admission grew MSSA, for which she is currently receiving nafcillin.

The patient underwent an intervention by Interventional Pulmonary, who placed a pigtail catheter and subsequently a chest tube. Thoracics performed an evacuation empyema and placed three chest tubes. Pleural and sputum studies are pending but indicate an exudate, with gram stain showing gram-positive cocci (GPC). Influenza was negative on admission, and tuberculosis (TB) is unlikely but will continue to be ruled out.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented initially with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. The patient's condition progressed, leading to the placement of a chest tube due to pulmonary findings on CT. She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula: The patient initially presented with pneumonia, which progressed to empyema and a bronchopleural fistula. She had positive blood cultures growing MSSA. The patient is currently being treated with nafcillin.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which was initially treated with dopamine. However, she responded to fluid resuscitation and is now off dopamine.
3. Diabetes: The patient may have developed type 1 DM, as she is experiencing symptoms consistent with it. Her insulin regimen has been adjusted accordingly.
4. Leukocytosis with bandemia: The patient has leukocytosis with a predominance of bands, likely due to her ongoing pulmonary infection. She is being treated with nafcillin and flagyl.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), who initially presented with pneumonia and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. The patient's condition progressed, leading to the placement of a chest tube due to pulmonary findings on a CT scan. She was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for relative hypotension.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula: The patient's blood cultures from 11/28 on admission, subsequent sputum from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and tissue from decortication on 12/6 grew MSSA. The patient is currently being treated with nafcillin. She underwent decortication, evacuation of empyema, and additional chest tube placement on 12/6. Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter and subsequently a chest tube on 12/4. The patient is briefly on flagyl but was discontinued on 12/7 due to the absence of anaerobes.

2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension has resolved. She is now fluid responsive and off dopamine for more than 48 hours. The patient has been restarted on met"

   # Pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula: [**1-21**]
   blood cultures from [**11-28**] on admission grew MSSA. On nafcillin.
   Levofloxacin started for community-acquired pneumonia has been
   discontinured.  Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter and
   subsequently a chest tube [**12-4**].  Pleural and sputum studies pending
   but indicative of an exudate, with gram stain showing GPC.  Influenza
   negative on admission.  Unlikely TB, but will continue rule-out.
   Thoracics s/p evacuation empyema and 3 chest tubes placed [**12-6**]. PPD
   negative. AFB negative *3. Stopped flagyl [**12-7**] due successful chest
   tube placement and no culture data to suggest need for this antibiotic.

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of type 2 DM, ESRD on PD who initially presented with pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. She has since developed pulmonary findings on CT, leading to the placement of a chest tube. The patient's blood cultures from 11/28 grew MSSA, and she has been started on nafcillin. Levofloxacin, initially given for community-acquired pneumonia, has been discontinued. Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter and subsequently a chest tube on 12/4. Pleural and sputum studies are pending but indicate an exudate, with gram stain showing GPC. Influenza was negative on admission. The patient is unlikely to have TB, but further ruling out is planned. Thoracics performed an evacuation empyema and placed three chest tubes on 12/6. PPD was negative, and AFB was negative three times. Flagyl was stopped on 12/7 due to successful chest tube placement and no culture data suggesting the need for this antibiotic. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, status post bare metal stenting, with no signs or symptoms of active ischemia. Her EKG remains unchanged, and cardiac enzymes are at baseline on admission. The patient's diabetes is being managed with Lantus increased to 13 units, and an insulin drip. She has leukoc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus type 1 and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presents with MSSA pneumonia complicated by empyema. She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with chest tubes in place. The patient was extubated yesterday without stridor.

The patient has a history of difficult intubation and airway edema but is now post 48 hours of solumedrol with positive cuff leak and Respiratory System Compliance Index (RSBI) of 40-50. She will be extubated with anesthesia present today.

The patient is on nafcillin for MSSA pneumonia and has three chest tubes in place due to persistent loculated effusion. Further management of the chest tubes will be discussed with thoracics.

The patient is also on peritoneal dialysis for chronic renal failure. Further plans for her care will be noted by the resident.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving a regular oral diet, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and arterial line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and peripheral IV access. She is also on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Communication with the family and code status are up to date. The patient's disposition is transfer to the floor."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presents with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia complicated by empyema. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and has chest tubes in place. 

24-hour events include being extubated yesterday. Allergies are not reported, and the last dose of antibiotics was nafcillin at 05:45 AM on 12/10/2158. The patient is receiving lansoprazole (Prevacid) at 08:00 AM on 12/10/2158.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/61 mmHg to 165/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 863 mL total, including 423 mL intravenously, and outputs of 50 mL per os, 100 mL through the Foley catheter, and 813 mL through chest tube drainage. Blood products totaling 5,089 mL have been transfused, and urine output is 20 mL. NG tube output and stool output are not assessed. Drains show a balance of -4,226 mL.

The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 136 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal range. Peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments are not evaluated due to limitations in patient assessment.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 22.5% to 26.5%, platelet count (Plt) of 358-535 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) levels decreasing from 11.7 mg/dL to 9.7 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 86 mg/dL to 153 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including low potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4). Other lab results are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with nafcillin due to MSSA infection and has undergone VATS with three chest tubes in place. There is increased drainage from the chest tubes, and further management will be discussed with thoracics.
2. Difficult intubation: The patient had a difficult intubation with some airway edema but has been extubated successfully with anesthesia present today.

3. Chronic renal failure: The patient is on peritoneal dialysis.
4. ICU Care: The patient is receiving a regular diet, and glycemic control is being maintained with insulin sliding scale. Arterial and multi-lumen lines have been inserted. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. Communication with the family is ongoing, and the patient's code status is full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type I and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presented with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia complicated by empyema. She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and has three chest tubes in place. The patient was extubated without stridor and is currently on nafcillin for her pneumonia. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/61 mmHg to 165/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. She is alert and conversant, although limited by a language barrier. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, creatinine of 11.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 117 mg/dL, and platelet count of 358 K/uL. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function. The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, and her abdominal ultrasound reveals minimal free fluid in the pelvis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has MSSA pneumonia that has progressed to empyema. There is a risk of worsening infection and possible sepsis.
2. Empyema: The presence of empyema increases the risk of pleural space infection, which may require further interventions such as additional drainage procedures.
3. Post-extubation Stridor: Although the patient was successfully extubated without stridor, there is still a risk of developing post-extubation airway complications.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis indicates underlying chronic kidney disease, which may contribute to electrolyte imbalances and fluid management challenges.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type I increases the risk of complications related to infection and wound healing.
6. Pleural Effusion: The presence of pleural effusion may require further evaluation and management, including repeated thoracentesis or consideration of indwelling pleural catheter placement.
7. Medication Reactions: Given the patient's multiple comorbidities and ongoing antibiotic treatment, there is a risk of medication interactions or adverse reactions.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the most appropriate course of action for the patient."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presents with MSSA pneumonia complicated by empyema and has undergone video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with chest tubes in place. The patient was extubated yesterday without stridor. She has no known drug allergies and received the last dose of antibiotics (nafcillin) at 05:45 AM on 12/10/2158. She is currently on various ICU medications, including Lansoprazole (Prevacid). Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/61 mmHg to 165/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with the patient watching TV. Her respiratory/chest examination shows bronchial breath sounds at the left base and chest tube x3 on the right. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, as well as her abdominal and neurologic examinations. She appears attentive and conversant, although limited by a language barrier.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (17.5 K/uL) and creatinine levels (11.7 mg/dL) with other lab values within normal ranges"
