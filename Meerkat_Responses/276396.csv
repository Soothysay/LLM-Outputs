   Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient given 20mg IV Lasix upon arrival to the floor as she was felt
   to have pulmonary edema secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   atrial fibrillation.  She urinated approximately 1200ml and her
   breathing improved.  She was transitioned from BiPap to facemask to
   nasal cannula.  She continues to cough intermittently, and has improved
   slightly with guaifenesin.
   She was rate-controlled with a diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po
   qid.  She intially came with HR
s in the 120

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7420**] M. [**Known lastname 7421**] is 71 year-old woman with pior history of
   [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia admitted for atrial fib/flutter
   with RVR and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is rate-controlled with HR in the 60
   on diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid.
   - Wean diltiazem drip as BP with MAPS in the 50
s this am
   - Increase Metoprolol 50 mg QID (double of home dose) to 75 mg
   metoprolol QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective beta-blocker and
   decided benefit would be minimal in short-term.
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
 likely transition to
   Coumadin for chronic anticoagulation
   - Patient less likely to benefit from cardioversion, and she was
   briefly in sinus rhythm yesterday and reverted back to Afib
   - ECHO today to r/o structural heart disease
   - If no CAD, consider sotalol, flecainide, or propefenone for
   anti-arrythmia as she may benefit from sinus rhythm
will consult EP
   today for their opinion
   - Continue heparin gtt pending EP recs of cardioversion possibility
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Patient with acute pulmonary edema in the
   setting of fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR.  Now with some
   residual coughing but on nasal cannula.
   - Diuresis prn with Lasix 20 mg IV for any recurrent SOB
   - Treat cough with prn ipratropium nebs and guiafenesin cough syrup prn
   - Rate control her as above
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF.
   .
   #. CAD - No known CAD, and no evidence that Afib is from ischemia.
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] Disease - Patient with [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease that stopped methimazole
   1 year ago. Her TSH has been progresively decreasing.  At this time her
   TSH is low, but with normal T3, free T4, and total t4.  Endocrine
   initially recommended methimazole due to low TSH, but felt that since
   her thyroid hormone levels were normal, thyroid disease likely did not
   precipitate her Afib.  She has been asymptomatic of any thyroid
   disease.
   - Appreciate endocrine recs
   - Metoprolol as above, will likely also treat thyroid disease if this
   is a precipitating factor
   .
   #. DM2 - Re-starting metformin at home-dose and will add ISS.
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt on dilt and metoprolol for now. Holding enalapril
   and HCTZ.
   .
   #. Smoking - Doing nicotine patch and social work.
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home-dose statin.
   .
   #. OA - Stable.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Will check echo to assess anatomic substrate of atrial arrhythmia
   Will advance beta blocker and get rid of diltiazem
   It is unclear what triggered this episode of what is now persistent
   a-fib/flutter and the treatment will depend
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7420**] M. [**Known lastname 7421**] is 71 year-old woman with pior history of
   [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia admitted for atrial fib/flutter
   with RVR and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is rate-controlled with HR in the 60
   on diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid.
   - Wean diltiazem drip as BP with MAPS in the 50
s this am
   - Increase Metoprolol 50 mg QID (double of home dose) to 75 mg
   metoprolol QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective beta-blocker and
   decided benefit would be minimal in short-term.
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
 likely transition to
   Coumadin for chronic anticoagulation
   - Patient less likely to benefit from cardioversion, and she was
   briefly in sinus rhythm yesterday and reverted back to Afib
   - ECHO today to r/o structural heart disease
   - If no CAD, consider sotalol, flecainide, or propefenone for
   anti-arrythmia as she may benefit from sinus rhythm
will consult EP
   today for their opinion
   - Continue heparin gtt pending EP recs of cardioversion possibility
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Patient with acute pulmonary edema in the
   setting of fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR.  Now with some
   residual coughing but on nasal cannula.
   - Diuresis prn with Lasix 20 mg IV for any recurrent SOB
   - Treat cough with prn ipratropium nebs and guiafenesin cough syrup prn
   - Rate control her as above
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF.
   .
   #. CAD - No known CAD, and no evidence that Afib is from ischemia.
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] Disease - Patient with [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease that stopped methimazole
   1 year ago. Her TSH has been progresively decreasing.  At this time her
   TSH is low, but with normal T3, free T4, and total t4.  Endocrine
   initially recommended methimazole due to low TSH, but felt that since
   her thyroid hormone levels were normal, thyroid disease likely did not
   precipitate her Afib.  She has been asymptomatic of any thyroid
   disease.
   - Appreciate endocrine recs
   - Metoprolol as above, will likely also treat thyroid disease if this
   is a precipitating factor
   .
   #. DM2 - Re-starting metformin at home-dose and will add ISS.
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt on dilt and metoprolol for now. Holding enalapril
   and HCTZ.
   .
   #. Smoking - Doing nicotine patch and social work.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a medical history of [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and respiratory distress. She received 20mg IV Lasix upon arrival to the floor, which helped alleviate pulmonary edema and improve her breathing. Her heart rate was initially in the range of 120-130 beats per minute but has now stabilized in the 60s with the use of diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid. The patient also experiences slight dizziness when sitting up and has low blood pressure (81/51). She continues to cough intermittently but has shown improvement with guaifenesin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rhythm: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is being rate-controlled with diltiazem drip and metoprolol. It is planned to wean the diltiazem drip as the blood pressure allows, increase metoprolol to 75 mg QID, and consider long-term anti-arrhythmic medications such as sotalol, flecainide, or propafenone after an echocardiogram to rule out structural heart disease. Consultation with an electrophysiologist (EP) will be sought for their opinion on cardioversion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU for management of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary edema, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient's medical history includes a 2+ mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension, with an ECG showing atrial fibrillation. Endocrine recommendations suggest starting low-dose methimazole to address subclinical thyrotoxicosis or nonthyroidal illness syndrome. The patient is also on warfarin for anticoagulation and has an ongoing plan for rate control and consideration of cardioversion.

24-hour events include stopping Diltiazem and Metoprolol due to concerns of bronchospasm and beta-blocker effects, respectively. Diltiazem was restarted at 30 mg po QID for better rate control. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 55% and mild PA hypertension with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) of 27 mm Hg. The patient's vital signs have been stable with a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/66 to 117/85 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,841 mL and output of 2,015 mL, resulting in a balance of 826 mL."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7420**] M. [**Known lastname 7421**] is 71 year-old woman with pior history of
   [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia admitted for atrial fib/flutter
   with RVR and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is modestly rate-controlled with HR in
   the 80-115s; currently on metoprolol 75 mg po qid and dilt po 30 mg tid
   - At this point, subclinical hyperthyroid is high on differential; Will
   increase methimazole to 10 mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol 75 mg QID (double of home dose) to 100 mg
   metoprolol QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective beta-blocker and
   decided benefit would be minimal in short-term.
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
 Started Coumadin for
   chronic anticoagulation; will check INR tomorrow
   - ECHO r/o structural heart disease
   - EP following, appreciate recs; will consider cardioversion at some
   point if patient does not convert to sinus and thyroid function
   stabilizes
   - Continue heparin gtt pending EP recs of cardioversion possibility
   - Endo following
appreciate recs
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Patient with acute pulmonary edema in the
   setting of fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR.  Now with some
   residual coughing but on nasal cannula.
   - Diuresis prn with Lasix 20 mg IV for any recurrent SOB
   - Treat cough with prn ipratropium nebs and guiafenesin cough syrup prn
   - Rate control her as above
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF.
   .
   #. CAD - No known CAD, and no evidence that Afib is from ischemia.
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] Disease
 Concern for subclinical thyrotoxicosis or TSH
   artifact due to nonthyroidal illness (ie sick euthyroid). Endocrine
   recommends starting methimazole
   - Endocrine recs appreciated
   - Metoprolol as above
   -methimazole 10 mg daily, will follow daily cbc
s to monitor for
   agranulocytosis.
   .
   #. DM2 - Re-starting metformin at home-dose and will add ISS.
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt on dilt and metoprolol for now. Holding enalapril
   and HCTZ.
   .
   #. Smoking - Doing nicotine patch and social work.
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home-dose statin.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: I believe that she has longstanding
   low grade thyrotoxicosis notwithstanding her nominally normal thyroid
   hormone levels.  Therefore we will treat her for thyrotoxicosis
   (methimazole) and uptitrate her beta blocker.  I anticipate spontaneous
   conversion to sinus rhythm after this therapy is implemented.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and osteoarthritis.
- She was admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress.
- The patient has been maintaining her pressures and is asymptomatic.
- She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol twice but successfully converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few seconds before reverting back to atrial fibrillation/flutter.
- Currently, the patient is modestly rate-controlled with a heart rate in the 80-115 range.
- She is on metoprolol 75 mg orally four times a day and diltiazem 30 mg orally four times a day.
- Subclinical hyperthyroidism is high on the differential, and methimazole will be increased to 10 mg daily.
- The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) will be checked tomorrow, and she has started on warfarin for chronic anticoagulation.
- An echocardiogram showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, and she is now on a nasal cannula.
- She will continue with Lasix 20 mg IV as needed for recurrent short"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and possibly subclinical hyperthyroidism. She was admitted for respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 118 bpm and blood pressure of 97/63 mmHg. She has a leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.7, but it has decreased to 11.6 today. She has received IV solumedrol and is on various medications including metoprolol, methimazole, heparin, and enalapril.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute pulmonary edema, which has improved significantly. However, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if fluid overload occurs again.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests a potential infection. It is important to monitor daily CBC and follow up with cultures to identify and treat any infection promptly.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, which may require further rate control measures or cardioversion if she does not convert to sinus rhythm.
4. Thyroid-related issues: The patient may have subclinical hyperthyroidism, for which methimazole has been started. Monitoring for agran"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and osteoarthritis. She was admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, methimazole, enalapril, statin, and nicotine patch.

Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm - The patient initially had atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response. She was successfully converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion but recurred. She is now modestly rate-controlled with a heart rate in the 80-115 range and on metoprolol 100 mg po qid.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient had acute pulmonary edema due to fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR. Her respiratory status has improved significantly, with negative fluid balance over 24 hours.
3. Leukocytosis - The patient's white blood cell count increased to 20.7 yesterday but is now down to 11.6 today. She received IV solumedrol in the ED, which may contribute to the elevated WBC count. There are no symptoms of infection.
4. [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] Disease - There is a concern for subclinical thyrotoxicosis or TSH artifact due to nonthyroidal illness. Methimazole has"
