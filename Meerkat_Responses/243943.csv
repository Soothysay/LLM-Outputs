   Assessment and Plan
   66 M with dyslipidemia/GERD found to have portal vein thrombosis and
   gram negative bacteremia
   # Portal vein thrombosis- DDx regarding etiology is broad at this point
   and includes undiagnosed liver disease, malignancy, collagen vascular
   disease, hypercoagulable disorder, IBD, sepsis.
   - Consulted liver team i.e. thrombectomy, discussed with liver fellow
   overnight and patient seen this morning
 will follow-up on their
   recommendations
   - Discuss with liver regarding MRCP and/or EGD/Colonoscopy to evaluate
   for portal HTN
   - Follow-up abdominal ultrasound to be done this morning to more fully
   assess liver/gallbladder/ascites/flow
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Trend daily CBC, LFT's, coagulation profile
   - Follow-up hepatitis serologies and hypercoagulable workup sent off at
   [**Hospital6 **]
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia- source likely GI and possibly, colorectal
   malignancy
   - continue ABX with Zosyn and Flagyl (~Day 2)
   - Follow-up blood cx and urinalysis with cx
   - [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 321**] Hospital speciation and sensitivities
   .
   # Anemia: Picture unclear given low iron, retic and MCV but normal
   ferritin (?acute phase reactant) and low TIBC. Possible multi-factorial
   picture given slightly high RDW (15.9). Patient possibly has iron
   deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease +/- liver disease. Iron
   deficiency anemia in a 65 yo male would put colorectal malignancy
   higher on the differential for patient
s portal vein thrombosis and
   gram negative bacteremia
   - Monitor for now
   .
   # GERD- hold PPI for now
   .
   # Dyslipidemia- hold Atorvastatin and Zetia for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with dyslipidemia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who has been diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis and gram-negative bacteremia. The patient's medical history is significant for undiagnosed liver disease, malignancy, collagen vascular disease, hypercoagulable disorder, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and sepsis. 

The patient presented with fever and tachycardia, and blood cultures were sent. He was given Tylenol and ice packs for fever reduction and started on intravenous fluids (IVF) at 125 cc/hr. The patient has no known drug allergies, and he received Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Metronidazole for antibiotic coverage.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 103.2 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate between 87-109 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 73-142 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with white blood cell counts of 13.5 and 14.7 thousand cells/microliter on two separate occasions. Other lab values reveal anemia with hemoglobin levels of 27.4 and 25.0 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 125"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was found to have portal vein thrombosis and gram-negative bacteremia. The potential etiologies for the portal vein thrombosis include undiagnosed liver disease, malignancy, collagen vascular disease, hypercoagulable disorder, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis. The patient is currently receiving heparin and antibiotics for treatment. Further evaluation and management are planned, including consultation with the liver team, MRCP and/or EGD to evaluate for portal hypertension, and a RUQ ultrasound with dopplers to assess the liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Portal vein thrombosis: This condition can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, liver dysfunction, and potential development of liver cirrhosis.
2. Gram-negative bacteremia: If left untreated, this can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Hypercoagulable disorder: The patient may be at an increased risk of developing blood clots in other areas of the body, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Liver disease: The patient's underlying liver condition may worsen if not properly managed.
5. Malignancy: If the patient has an underlying malignancy, it could progress and cause further complications.
6. Collagen vascular disease: If present, it may contribute to the development of additional complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and abdominal pain. He was found to have portal vein thrombosis on CT scan, and has been treated with heparin and antibiotics. The patient's blood cultures were positive, but the mechanism of bacteremia is unclear. He is currently on IV antibiotics and surveillance blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Portal vein thrombosis: This condition can lead to complications such as liver damage, abscess formation, or spread of infection.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream can result in sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
3. Hepatitis: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal bilirubin levels may indicate ongoing liver inflammation or damage.
4. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function, which could be due to dehydration, medication side effects, or other underlying causes.
5. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/INR and low platelet count may indicate a bleeding tendency, which can increase the risk of hemorrhage.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), which may increase the risk of malnutrition and compromise the immune system.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical progress to identify any potential complications early on and provide appropriate interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 M with dyslipidemia/GERD found to have portal vein thrombosis and
   gram negative bacteremia
   # Portal vein thrombosis- DDx regarding etiology is broad at this point
   and includes undiagnosed liver disease, malignancy, collagen vascular
   disease, hypercoagulable disorder, IBD, sepsis.
   - Consulted liver team i.e. thrombectomy, discussed with liver fellow
   overnight and patient seen this morning
 will follow-up on their
   recommendations
   - Discuss with liver regarding MRCP and/or EGD/Colonoscopy to evaluate
   for portal HTN
   - Follow-up abdominal ultrasound to be done this morning to more fully
   assess liver/gallbladder/ascites/flow
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Trend daily CBC, LFT's, coagulation profile
   - Follow-up hepatitis serologies and hypercoagulable workup sent off at
   [**Hospital6 **]
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia- source likely GI and possibly, colorectal
   malignancy
   - continue ABX with Zosyn and Flagyl (~Day 2)
   - Follow-up blood cx and urinalysis with cx
   - [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 321**] Hospital speciation and sensitivities

   # Anemia: Picture unclear given low iron, retic and MCV but normal
   ferritin (?acute phase reactant) and low TIBC. Possible multi-factorial
   picture given slightly high RDW (15.9). Patient possibly has iron
   deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease +/- liver disease. Iron

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with dyslipidemia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He was found to have portal vein thrombosis and gram-negative bacteremia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Portal vein thrombosis: This condition can lead to further clotting in the liver, potentially causing liver damage or failure. It may also result in the formation of varices, which are enlarged veins that can rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding.

2. Gram-negative bacteremia: This infection can spread to other parts of the body, including the bloodstream, lungs, and kidneys. It may lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.

3. Colorectal malignancy: Given the patient's age and the presence of anemia, there is a possibility of underlying colorectal cancer. This could be the source of the gram-negative bacteremia and should be investigated further.

4. Liver disease: The patient's liver function tests show elevated ALT and AST levels, indicating possible liver damage or dysfunction. This could be related to the portal vein thrombosis or underlying liver disease.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but the cause is unclear. It could be due to iron deficiency, chronic disease, or liver disease. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.

6. Hypercoagulable disorder: The patient may have a predisposition to develop blood clots"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with dyslipidemia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who was found to have portal vein thrombosis and gram-negative bacteremia. He is currently febrile and producing positive blood cultures despite antibiotic treatment. The possible etiologies for the portal vein thrombosis include undiagnosed liver disease, malignancy, sepsis, and diverticulitis. The patient is planned for an interventional radiology (IR) portal venography with lysis, but this procedure is on hold. Diagnostic tests including a CT torso, MRCP, and colonoscopy are being considered to evaluate the clot and potential underlying causes. Heparin drip is continued, and follow-up blood cultures and urinalysis will be done. The patient's anemia is unclear due to low iron, reticulocyte count, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) but normal ferritin and low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Possible causes include iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease, and liver disease. The patient's dyslipidemia medications, Atorvastatin and Zetia, are held for now. A nutrition consult has been requested for the patient's nutritional needs. The patient's code status is full code, and he may be transferred to the floor today."

- The plan includes early communication with the liver team, a CT scan of the torso to evaluate for clot and potential etiologies, ruling out pulmonary embolism (PE), and considering MRCP and colonoscopy as possible options.
- The patient will continue on heparin drip, and follow-up hepatitis serologies and hypercoagulable workup will be sent off.
- The patient continues to be febrile and produce positive blood cultures despite antibiotic therapy.
- It is likely that either the portal vein clot is seeded and septic now, or that he has another source such as a liver abscess that is seeding the blood.
- The source likely originates from the gastrointestinal tract and possibly a colorectal malignancy.
- The patient will continue on Zosyn and Flagyl (Day 3), with follow-up blood cultures and urinalysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 M with dyslipidemia/GERD found to have portal vein thrombosis and
   gram negative bacteremia
    # Portal vein thrombosis- DDx regarding etiology is broad and includes
   undiagnosed liver disease, malignancy, sepsis. Plan for IR portal
   venography w/ lysis is on hold. Ideal diagnosis would tie together
   thrombus, bacteremia and elevated bili and LFTs.
   - Early communication this AM with liver team
   - Likely CT torso today to evaluate both ab/pelvis for clot and
   etiologies behind, and to r/o PE (see below)
   - MRCP and colonoscopy also possible options
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - F/u hepatitis serologies and hypercoagulable workup sent off at

   - F/u colono records from 5 years ago at [**Hospital1 321**] Gen
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia- Continues to be febrile and to produce
   +blood cxs despite abx. It is likely that either the portal vein clot
   is seeded and septic now, or that he has another source such as a liver
   abscess that is seeding the blood. Source likely GI and possibly,
   colorectal malignancy.
   - continue Zosyn and Flagyl (Day 3)
   - Follow-up blood cx and urinalysis with cx
   - [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 321**] Hospital speciation and sensitivities
   - Needs prostate exam for prostatitis
   # Dyspnea: Pt has new O2 requirement of [**2-14**] lpm NC o/n, feels
   subjectively short of breath. DDx includes PE (given known clot), heart
   failure, sepsis/infectious. If PE is dx he is already on Heparin gtt.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of dyslipidemia and GERD. He was found to have portal vein thrombosis and gram-negative bacteremia. The possible etiologies for the portal vein thrombosis include undiagnosed liver disease, malignancy, or sepsis. The patient is currently on hold for an interventional radiology (IR) procedure to perform a portal venography with lysis. 

The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes, including AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and direct bilirubin. An ultrasound did not reveal any gallbladder pathology, but there is an echogenic liver. The patient also has anemia that appears to be iron-deficiency in nature. 

The patient is still febrile and producing positive blood cultures despite antibiotic treatment. He is suspected to have another source of infection, such as a liver abscess or colorectal malignancy. 

The patient has new oxygen requirements and feels short of breath. Differential diagnoses for his dyspnea include pulmonary embolism (PE), heart failure, or sepsis/infectious causes. 

The patient's elevated BNP levels, ABG assessment for A-a gradient, and an echocardiogram are planned to further evaluate his dyspnea. Additionally, a CT scan of the torso is scheduled to evaluate for any clot or underlying etiologies, including ruling out PE.

   gram negative bacteremia
    # Portal vein thrombosis-Still no clear etiology, as imaging (MRCP/CT)
   unrevealing for hepatobiliary abnormalities other than fatty
   infiltration. No known risk factors for hypercoagulable
   state
malignancy is on the differential, but patient has a normal
   PSA/DRE and reportedly had a normal colonoscopy in recent years. IR not
   planning to perform lysis.
   - Appreciate hepatology recs
   - Awaiting autoimmune/infectious serologies
   - ERCP today to further evaluate for hepatobiliary injury that could
   have led to PV thrombus
   - Continue heparin gtt after ERCP
   - F/u cx sensies from [**Hospital1 321**] Gen
   - F/u colono records from 5 years ago at [**Hospital1 321**] Gen
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia- Afebrile with normal WBC count. On Day 4
   zosyn/flagyl. Cultures at OSH positive for proteus. Sensitivies on
   unknown organism on [**Hospital1 19**] BCx reveal pan-sensitive bug. No hepatic
   abscess on imaging. Given Bacteremia and thrombus, there may
   potentially be bacterial seeding of clot. No prostatitis on labs/exam.
   No other hx of GI bleed (guaiac negative today).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of dyslipidemia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He presented with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and gram-negative bacteremia. The patient has anemia, which appears to be iron-deficiency but without evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Elevated liver enzymes were noted, suggesting a primary liver issue such as fatty liver or cirrhosis. The patient is scheduled for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) today to further evaluate hepatobiliary injury that could have led to PVT. He is currently receiving heparin for PVT prophylaxis and antibiotics for bacteremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Portal vein thrombosis: The presence of PVT increases the risk of complications such as liver abscess, bowel ischemia, and portal hypertension.
2. Gram-negative bacteremia: The patient's bloodstream infection with a gram-negative organism may lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Anemia: If left untreated or unmanaged, the patient's anemia could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Elevated liver enzymes: Persistent elevation of liver enzymes may indicate ongoing liver injury or inflammation, which could progress to liver failure if not addressed.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's transient requirement for supplemental oxygen suggests a potential risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with dyslipidemia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who was found to have portal vein thrombosis and gram-negative bacteremia. The imaging studies, including MRCP and CT, revealed nearly occlusive thrombus within the left portal vein and partially occlusive thrombus within the right portal vein with minimal extension into the distal main portal vein. The thrombus is likely acute to subacute in age, and no collateralization has formed. There are also mild perfusional abnormalities noted in segment VI and VII of the liver secondary to the presence of portal venous thrombosis. Additionally, the patient has bilateral pleural effusions, trace ascites, and mild diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. 

The patient has been on heparin gtt since 03:30 PM on 1/21 and will continue it after ERCP today. The patient's gram-negative bacteremia is caused by Proteus, which is pan-sensitive except resistant to tetracycline. The patient is currently on Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Metronidazole. The patient's dyspnea has resolved, but he still has anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and GERD. The patient's dyslipidemia medications, Atorvastatin and Zetia, have been held due to elevated liver function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 M with dyslipidemia/GERD found to have portal vein thrombosis and
   gram negative bacteremia
    # Portal vein thrombosis- DDx regarding etiology is broad and includes
   undiagnosed liver disease, malignancy, sepsis. Plan for IR portal
   venography w/ lysis is on hold. Ideal diagnosis would tie together
   thrombus, bacteremia and elevated bili and LFTs.
   - Early communication this AM with liver team
   - Likely CT torso today to evaluate both ab/pelvis for clot and
   etiologies behind, and to r/o PE (see below)
   - MRCP and colonoscopy also possible options
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - F/u hepatitis serologies and hypercoagulable workup sent off at
   [**Hospital6 **]
   - F/u cx sensies from [**Hospital1 321**] Gen
   - F/u colono records from 5 years ago at [**Hospital1 321**] Gen
   .
   # Gram negative bacteremia- Continues to be febrile and to produce
   +blood cxs despite abx. It is likely that either the portal vein clot
   is seeded and septic now, or that he has another source such as a liver
   abscess that is seeding the blood. Source likely GI and possibly,
   colorectal malignancy.
   - continue Zosyn and Flagyl (Day 3)
   - Follow-up blood cx and urinalysis with cx
   - [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 321**] Hospital speciation and sensitivities
   - Needs prostate exam for prostatitis
   # Dyspnea: Pt has new O2 requirement of [**2-14**] lpm NC o/n, feels
   subjectively short of breath. DDx includes PE (given known clot), heart
   failure, sepsis/infectious. If PE is dx he is already on Heparin gtt.
   -          BNP
   -          ABG to assess for A-a gradient (for PE)
   -          Echo
   -          Likely CT torso today to evaluate both ab/pelvis for clot
   and etiologies behind, and to r/o PE
   -          Monitor closely
   # Anemia: Looks like iron-deficiency anemia (low iron, low retics, low
   MCV). Likely a colorectal malignancy will tie together various issues,
   including this anemia.
   - T&S
   - PM Hct
   - stool guiac
   # Elevated liver enzymes: AST, ALT, Alk Phos and direct bili all
   elevated. But per U/S no gall bladder path. Echogenic liver. Likely a
   primary liver issue, such as fatty liver, cirrhosis, etc
   -          D/w GI liver early
   -          CT of abdomen/torso
   # GERD- hold PPI for now
   .
   # Dyslipidemia- hold Atorvastatin and Zetia given LFTs
   # FEN: Regular, replete electrolytes, nutrition consult
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with dyslipidemia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who was found to have portal vein thrombosis and gram-negative bacteremia. The patient's medical history is significant for undiagnosed liver disease, malignancy, and sepsis. The patient has been febrile and producing positive blood cultures despite antibiotic treatment, suggesting a possible source of infection such as a liver abscess or colorectal malignancy. The patient also has new-onset dyspnea, shortness of breath, and an increased requirement for supplemental oxygen. There is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) or heart failure. The patient's anemia is consistent with iron-deficiency anemia, likely secondary to colorectal malignancy. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating a primary liver issue such as fatty liver or cirrhosis. The patient has been placed on heparin therapy for portal vein thrombosis and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further diagnostic tests including CT torso, MRCP, colonoscopy, and hypercoagulable workup have been ordered to investigate the underlying causes of the thrombosis and bacteremia. The patient's code status has been set to full code, and the current disposition is in the ICU.
