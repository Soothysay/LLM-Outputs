   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with hypotension/sepsis all concerning
   for cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain in the setting of
   decreased po intake and now with progressive dyspnea and peripheral
   edema.  Initially she was treated for UTI with bactrim with incomplete
   response.  She then evolved worsening abdominal discomfort and was
   found to have severe obstruction of biliary system with obstructing
   stone and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care in
   anticipation of ERCP and stone removal.
   1)ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-Patient above baseline and with sepsis has likely
   poor perfusion and resultant ATN
   -Follow urine output
   -Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE--Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-_Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   CHOLANGITIS
S/P ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE-
   -Will need ECHO to follow up and define EF
   -Hold lasix and anti-hypertensive
   -Follow enzymes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with hypotension, sepsis, and cholangitis. The patient has a history of abdominal pain, decreased oral intake, and progressive dyspnea and peripheral edema. She was initially treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with incomplete response. Subsequently, she developed severe obstruction of the biliary system with an obstructing stone, leading to her transfer to another hospital for further care.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stone removal, but subsequently developed respiratory failure, acute renal failure, congestive heart failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia, low blood pressure, and altered oxygen saturation. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, abnormal liver function tests, and acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of acute renal failure, exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and persistent or recurrent sepsis. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, urine output, serum creatinine levels, and response to antibiotics will be crucial in managing these conditions. Additionally, further evaluation and management of the underlying causes, such as the obstructing mass at the papilla and cholangiocarcinoma, will be necessary."

   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock caused by cholangitis, following a month of abdominal pain. She underwent an ERCP procedure which revealed a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin gtt.

Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is likely related to biliary obstruction with cholecystitis and cholangitis. The obstruction may be due to a mass seen at the papilla, leading to subsequent sepsis.
- Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl) to cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary sources. Cultures and clinical course will be followed to look for resolution.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated peri-procedure and had clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted. Evidence of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiration admitted. The patient now has minimal resistance on ventilator, consistent with poor compliance. Weaning of ventilator support will be necessary in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
- The plan is to move to Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) when able and continue with Assist-Control (A/C) mode.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted with septic shock due to cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain. She underwent an ERCP procedure, which showed a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, suggesting malignancy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin gtt.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock related to biliary obstruction with cholecystitis and cholangitis. The obstruction may be caused by the mass seen at the papilla, leading to sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated peri-procedure and had clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted. There is evidence of emesis peri-intubation, but no aspiration admitted to. The patient now has minimal resistance on the ventilator, consistent with poor compliance. Weaning of ventilator support will be necessary in the setting of treatment for sepsis.

3. Cholangitis: The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, stent placement, and will require drainage. Pathology on the mass will guide long-term intervention and treatment, with concern for possible cholangiocarcinoma.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's above baseline creatinine level and sepsis suggest"

   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on

   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above

   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following a month of abdominal pain. She underwent an ERCP, which showed a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. The patient is unresponsive and intubated, with ongoing respiratory and renal failure. She also has evidence of congestive heart failure. The patient's medical team has initiated various treatments and interventions to manage her conditions, including antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, intubation, and placement of a stent in the biliary tree. Further diagnostic tests, such as an MRI and blood cultures, are pending. The patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring and ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of poor renal perfusion, likely due to sepsis, which can lead to acute renal failure. Monitoring urine output, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and trending creatinine levels will be important in managing this complication.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has minimal resistance on the ventilator, indicating poor compliance. Weaning off ventilator support will be challenging, especially in the setting of ongoing sepsis treatment.
3. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from sepsis secondary to biliary obstruction with cholecystitis and cholangitis. The source of infection is likely the obstructed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of septic shock from cholangitis, now presenting with a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy.
- She underwent an ERCP procedure and was intubated peri-procedure due to unresponsiveness off sedation.
- Post-procedure, the patient demonstrated ischemia to her extremities, a new right fixed and dilated pupil, and a hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe on CT scan.
- The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, limb ischemia, acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and congestive heart failure.
- The patient is currently on multiple pressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has had various interventions attempted to address her critical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coma: The patient's unresponsiveness off sedation and impaired right pupillary light reflex raise concern for herniation or brainstem lesion. Repeat head CT is recommended to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt, and neurology follow-up is advised.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses require ongoing pressor support. Coags are all prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia and anemia. Fibrinogen is"

   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock from cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain. She underwent an ERCP procedure, which demonstrated a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after starting heparin gtt.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Coma: The patient is unresponsive off sedation, and there is impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex, which is concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion. Repeat stat head CT is recommended to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring two pressors. SVO2 is 94%, CVP is 11, and lactate is elevated to 4.5. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending. Adjustments to the antibiotic regimen will be made as necessary.

3. Limb Ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally, as well as some mottling of the right hand. Vascular surgery was consulted, and heparin"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with baseline Cr of 1.1, currently Cr
   1.8 in context of sepsis and poor perfusion. UOP initially poor
   (~20cc/hr), but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may
   indicate improved end-organ perfusion.
   -Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock caused by cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain. She underwent an ERCP, which revealed a large mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new fixed, dilated pupil after heparin gtt. She also has evidence of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiration admitted to, and minimal resistance on the ventilator consistent with poor compliance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. This can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs.
3. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, an infection of the bile ducts, which can lead to sepsis if not treated effectively.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 1.8, indicating possible acute renal failure due to sepsis and poor perfusion.
5. dCHF (diastolic Heart Failure): The patient is diagnosed with dCHF, which can lead to fluid accumulation and pulmonary edema.

   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain. She underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, potentially indicative of malignancy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after starting heparin gtt.

Medical Complications:
1. Coma: The patient is unresponsive off sedation, with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex, concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion. Neurology is following up, and a repeat stat head CT is recommended to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. Septic Shock: The patient has leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring two pressors. SVO2 is 94%, CVP is 11, and lactate is elevated at 4.5. Coagulation abnormalities are present, including prolonged coagulation times, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient's condition remains severely ill and unresponsive.
3. Limb Ischemia: The patient exhibits cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of the LE"

   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with septic shock due to cholangitis, following one month of abdominal pain. She underwent ERCP, which showed a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin gtt.

Medical Complications:
1. Coma: The patient is unresponsive off sedation, with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex, concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion.
2. Limb ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally, with no dopplerable dp pulses bilaterally.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated peri-procedure, unable to be weaned from the ventilator after failing a Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT). The patient demonstrated poor compliance on the ventilator.
4. Acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis: The patient has a rising creatinine level and urine sodium of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic renal process likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has worsened to 24.0 this AM after significant blood loss from attempted central venous line placement.

   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 4.5. this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed and Vasopressin as well as
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. WBC improved this AM, but clinically
   remains severely ill and unresponsive. Surgery recommending bedside RUQ
   U/S & IR percutaneous chole drainage
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally. Can restart if head CT negative for
   hemorrhage.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Consider Nitro paste on extremities to counteract effect of pressors
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters given risk of ARDS
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S
   - PIV
s in place
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC

   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left

   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Neurosurgery consult
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Patient is currently on Levophed and
   Vasopressin as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics. WBC improved this
   AM, but clinically remains severely ill and unresponsive.
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with baseline Cr of 1.1, currently Cr
   1.8 in context of sepsis and poor perfusion. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.

","The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted with septic shock from cholangitis following a month of abdominal pain. She underwent an ERCP that showed a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after restarting heparin gtt.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, with a blood pressure of 100/48 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on supplemental oxygen. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination reveals a firm, non-distended abdomen without bowel sounds. She has mottled and cold extremities with no dopplerable dp pulses bilaterally, but her pulses are intact. The left pupil is equal, round, and reactive to light, while the right pupil is dyscoric and non-reactive to light.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.2 K/uL. Her hemoglobin is 7.7 g/dL, and her platelet count is 117. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes and abnormal renal function tests.

Imaging studies reveal a normal biventricular cavity size with preserved global and regional biv"

   -Will need to consider patient at high risk for evolution of ARDS
   -We will see continued need for maintenance of effective ventilation to
   look to sedate patient to tolerate effective ventilation.
   -Will look to maintain Ve at 8-10 with Vt at 6cc/Kg at this time
   -Will need titration to ABG across the day
   2) SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-Persistent and severe compromise in
   perfusion despite CVP at >12 and requiring 2 pressors and now adding a
   3^rd.  ScVO2 has been >90%, we have CVP at 12 this morning.  This is
   all consistent with severe vasodilatory state with distributative shock
   with concern for infection from possible biliary source and or possible
   pneumonia.  We will need to reverse infection with
   -Evaluation with radiology to consider percutaneous drainage of
   gallbladder system

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with an initial admission for sepsis and cholangitis, found to have a concerning mass lesion in the ampulla consistent with adenocarcinoma. The patient's health progress in the ICU includes respiratory failure, persistent sepsis, limb ischemia, and altered mental status.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS) - This is secondary to severe metabolic acidosis with associated respiratory failure in the setting of bilateral effusions. The patient will continue with support using optimized ventilatory support and may be at high risk for the evolution of ARDS.

2. SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION - Persistent and severe compromise in perfusion despite CVP at >12 and requiring 2 pressors and now adding a 3rd. The patient's severe vasodilatory state with distributative shock is consistent with sepsis, possibly from a biliary source and/or possible pneumonia. Antibiotics will be evaluated to reverse infection, and radiology will be used to consider percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder system. Pressors will be maintained to support adequate blood pressure.

3. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-METABOLIC ACIDOSIS - The patient's renal function may be compromised due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) at this time. Support through ATN and"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 4.5. this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed and Vasopressin as well as
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. WBC improved this AM, but clinically
   remains severely ill and unresponsive. Surgery recommending bedside RUQ
   U/S & IR percutaneous chole drainage

   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally. Can restart if head CT negative for
   hemorrhage.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Consider Nitro paste on extremities to counteract effect of pressors
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters given risk of ARDS
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis, a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia to her extremities. The patient has multiple medical complications including coma, limb ischemia, respiratory failure, cholangitis, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and congestive heart failure. The patient's condition has been deteriorating despite aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain herniation: The patient's unilateral fixed and dilated pupil suggests a possible brain herniation, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock indicates an ongoing infection that can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly.
3. Limb ischemia: The patient's cool, mottled, cyanotic toes, and mottling of the right hand indicate compromised blood flow to the extremities, which may result in tissue damage or loss if not addressed.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator suggests respiratory distress, which can progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
5. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis, indicated by a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, requires further evaluation and treatment to prevent complications such as sepsis or liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension requiring 3 pressors, unresponsive
   to IVF boluses. CVP 18. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Patient is
   currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Family would like to gather to readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   - family meeting, may make patient CMO and withdraw supportive
   measures.
   # Coma: likely [**2-24**] sepsis, also with new ? brain mets.  Appreciate
   neuro input, though further neuro w/u deferred given overall prognosis.
   - f/u neuro recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Likely [**2-24**] pressor, though also possible thrombus, given
   initial unilateral presenation, renal and splenic infacts on ct.
   - heparin gtt
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Currently hypercarbic on LTTV.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters
   - increase Tv to increase pH, decrease pCO2
   - Repeat ABG
   # Ampulllary Mass/Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: path from ampulla showed
   high grade undifferentiated malignant tumor.  Mediastinal LAD
   susp[icious for lymphoma.  Regardless, given current clinical scenario,
   cancer diagnosis only contributes to a grim prognosis, and further w/u
   unnecessary.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - steroids
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - continue bicarbonate gtt
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   - Trend creatinine, lytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to cholangitis following a month of abdominal pain. She underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and was found to have a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. The patient is currently unresponsive, on maximum doses of three pressors, and has limb ischemia with a possible right frontal lobe metastasis. She has been diagnosed with high-grade poorly differentiated malignant tumor in the ampulla biopsy, with immunostains pending. The family has made the decision for the patient to be do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's worsening condition, including leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary infection, and hypotension, requires ongoing management with three pressors. There is an elevated lactate level of 7.0, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion.

2. Coma: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis-induced coma, along with new possible brain metastasis. Neurological input is required, although further neuro evaluation has been deferred due to the overall prognosis.

3. Limb Ischemia: The patient presents with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of the lower extremities, as well as some mottling of the right hand. V"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with septic shock following an ERCP procedure. The patient's condition has been unstable, with several significant events occurring within the 24-hour period.

Firstly, the patient's neurologic status has raised concerns, with hypodensities noted and recommendations for an MRI to further characterize the findings before anticoagulating. The neurologists later recommended heparinizing the patient with repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI as mentioned earlier. However, the patient's clinical status worsened, leading to the decision to stop heparin.

Secondly, the patient experienced progressively worsening hypotension, reaching maximum doses of neo, levo, and vasopressin. The patient's right pupil appeared dilated and fixed, prompting the cessation of heparin. A head CT showed stability at this time.

Thirdly, plans were made to replace the central venous line (CVL), but due to the worsening clinical status, this procedure was deferred.

Fourthly, the CT-CAP revealed several abnormalities, including a right upper lobe nodule, extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy suggestive of lymphoma, bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis, cholelithiasis, splenic infarcts, renal infarct, umbilical hernia with a hyperdense lesion likely barium in diverticulum vs. strangulated epip"

   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 3
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Critically
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally. Can restart if head CT negative for
   hemorrhage.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Consider Nitro paste on extremities to counteract effect of pressors
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters given risk of ARDS
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT

   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted with chlangitis and now with refractory septic
   shock in the setting of extensive and widespread adenopathy concerning
   for widespread malignancy.  She has had persistent sepsis with
   inability to return to meaningful perfusion of tissues as evidenced by
   continued rise in lactate.  We have persistent acidemia despite
   maximized support on the ventilator and utilization of the bicarbonate
   drip.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE-
   -Will continue with A/C support
   -We have continued to maintain low tidal volume ventilation as
   protective strategy to minimize ARDS risk
   2) SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-
   -Steroids in place
   -Pressors at maxium
   -Broad spectrum antibiotics in place
   -Ongoing fluid bolus without effect of durable response in terms of
   blood pressure stability.
   3)Cholangitis-Patient with mass lesion obstructing biliary system with
   stent drainage in place which has local control but we are left with
   diffuse and extensive cancer
   -Continue drainage
   4)Acidemia-
   -Persistent anion gap acidosis with optimization of vent support
   -Will need to continue with HCO3- gtt

   Communication:  Comments:  Will have to move to family meeting to
   discuss CMO status in the setting of persistent and refractory shock,
   acidemia in the setting of cholangitis and diffuse high grade
   malignancy without reasonable expectation for meaningful recovery.
   Code status: DNR
   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 75
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with cholangitis and refractory septic shock in the setting of extensive and widespread adenopathy concerning for widespread malignancy. The patient has persistent sepsis with an inability to return to meaningful perfusion of tissues, as evidenced by continued rise in lactate. There is also respiratory failure with ongoing need for assisted ventilation and acidemia despite maximized ventilator support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Multi-organ failure: The patient's refractory septic shock and widespread adenopathy may lead to dysfunction of multiple organs, such as the kidneys, liver, and heart.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Due to the persistent respiratory failure and low tidal volume ventilation, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can result in severe lung dysfunction.
3. Widespread malignancy progression: The presence of high-grade malignancy and diffuse adenopathy suggests the possibility of cancer progression, leading to further complications and deterioration of the patient's condition.
4. Infection recurrence: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a risk of recurrent infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing sepsis.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's persistent tachycardia and hypertension indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability, which may require continuous monitoring and adjustment of vasopressor support.
6. Renal dysfunction: The elevated serum"
