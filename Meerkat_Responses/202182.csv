   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old female with morbid obesity and hypertension admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with transient hypotension, lethargy and pressure ulcers now s/p
   debridement by plastics
   # Hypotension: Resolved for now. Patient transiently hypotensive in ED
   after morphine but remainder of SBPs in 110s-120s so likely related to
   meds as well as significant component of dehydration by labs and exam
   and underlying infection.
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - avoid morphine IV for now, use oxycodone and tylenol prn pain
   - ROMI
   - Advance diet and encourage PO intake
   # Pressure Ulcers: Patient has developed pressure ulcers from large
   pannus and immobility. Per plastics, did not seem particularly infected
   but will continue with antibiotics given leukocytosis and no other
   obvious source. Plastics recommends general surgery consult for
   debridement as risk of underlying bowel under the ulcers. They also
   recommend considering a CT abdomen to r/o underlying abscess,
   unfortunately this would be impossible at [**Hospital1 5**] as her extreme habitus
   would preclude fitting in the scanner.
   - General surgery consult
   - Appreciate plastics recommendations
   - continue vanco/unasyn for likely polymicrobial wound infection
   - check vanco trough prior to 4th dose
   - follow up blood cx
   - wound care per plastics: pack the wounds with moist to dry dressing
   changes with 0.25 dakins solution at least twice a day
   # ARF: Much improved to 1.3 after IVF. Cr elevated to 1.8 with unclear
   baseline. Urine lytes, BUN/Cr ratio, HCT all consistent with
   dehydration and prerenal etiology with urine Na<10. Received 4L IVF in
   ED and asking for water and complaining of thirst.
   - Continue IVF boluses.
   - Advance diet and encourage PO intake
   - consider renal U/S if remains elevated
   # Leukocytosis: Most likely etiology infected wounds and ulcers. CXR
   negative and UA contaminated but with only 0-2WBC and neg nitrate and
   leuk.
   - follow up blood and urine cx
   - continue to trend
   - repeat CXR
 wnl on my read
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear baseline but patient clearly altered
   on exam although redirectable upon further questioning. Likely delirium
   from infectious process and dehydration. [**Month (only) 8**] also be component of
   hyppercarbia given obesity and RBBB, likely OSA and pulmonary
   hypertension. Meninigitis less likely given lack of fever and
   improvement with IVF
   - check ABG
 wnl
   - check TSH, B12

   - continue IVF boluses
   - treat infection as above
   # Hyponatremia: Resolving after IVF. Likely hypovolemic given other
   findings as above
   - Continue IVF per above
   # Elevated lactate: Resolving after IVF. Likely secondary to
   dehydration given hyponatremia, elevated CK
   - Continue IVF per above
   # Elevated CK: Improving. Likely has low grade rhabdo secondary to
   prolonged immobilization.
   - Continue IVF per above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with transient hypotension, lethargy, and pressure ulcers that underwent debridement by plastics. The patient's hypotension has resolved, but she continues to receive IV fluids. She has developed pressure ulcers due to large pannus and immobility, for which antibiotics have been started and a general surgery consult has been requested. The patient also has acute kidney injury, likely secondary to dehydration, and her electrolytes are imbalanced. She is leucocytosis, which could be due to infected wounds and ulcers. Her mental status is altered, possibly due to an infectious process, dehydration, or other factors such as OSA and pulmonary hypertension. She has hyponatremia, resolving after IVF, and elevated lactate levels, also improving with IVF. The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Her glucose tolerance is impaired, and she is receiving insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has developed pressure ulcers with purulent exudate, indicating a potential infection. The presence of leukocytosis supports this possibility. The patient is already on antibiotics, and follow-up blood and urine cultures have been ordered.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury needs"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension admitted to the ICU with transient hypotension, lethargy, and pressure ulcers. The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note.

1. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the ED after receiving morphine, but subsequent blood pressures in the 110s-120s range suggest that it may be related to medications as well as significant dehydration and underlying infection.

2. Pressure Ulcers: The patient has developed pressure ulcers due to large pannus and immobility. Although they do not seem particularly infected, the patient is being continued on antibiotics due to leukocytosis and no other obvious source.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated to 1.8 with an unclear baseline. Urine electrolytes are consistent with prerenal etiology with urine sodium less than 10. The patient has received 4 liters of IV fluids in the ED and is asking for water, complaining of thirst.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is most likely due to infected wounds and ulcers. A chest X-ray is negative, and a urine analysis is contaminated with only 0-2 white blood cells and negative nitrites and leukocytes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with transient hypotension, lethargy, and pressure ulcers that have undergone debridement by plastics. The patient has necrotic pressure ulcers with pus and signs of venous stasis. There is concern for polymicrobial infection, and she is currently on antibiotics. Her blood culture was taken twice. She also has an altered mental status, likely secondary to infection and dehydration, along with elements of depression. The patient's hypertension is likely essential, and she is also experiencing acute kidney injury, resolving with IV fluids, and hyponatremia, also resolving with IV fluids. Her elevated creatine kinase (CK) is improving and may be due to low-grade rhabdomyolysis from prolonged immobilization. There is impaired glucose tolerance, likely due to glucose intolerance. The patient is receiving nutritional support and is being monitored for niacin and folate levels. She has a history of neglect and is on citalopram (Celexa) for depression. The patient's condition requires further evaluation and management, including an echocardiogram to assess for pulmonary hypertension, RV motion, and other cardiac parameters. Her heparin dose has been increased to 7500 units TID. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 174/65 to 199/87 mmHg,"

   obvious source. Plastics recommends general surgery consult for
   debridement as risk of underlying bowel under the ulcers. They also
   recommend considering a CT abdomen to r/o underlying abscess,

   baseline. Urine lytes, BUN/Cr ratio, HCT all consistent with
   dehydration and prerenal etiology with urine Na<10. Received 4L IVF in
   ED and asking for water and complaining of thirst.
   - Continue IVF boluses.
   - Advance diet and encourage PO intake
   - consider renal U/S if remains elevated

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension admitted to the ICU with transient hypotension, lethargy, and pressure ulcers. She has a history of depression and cellulitis. The patient's current conditions include hypovolemia, depression, decubitus ulcer, obesity, and alterations in nutrition. She is experiencing hypotension, pressure ulcers, acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hyponatremia, elevated lactate, elevated CK, impaired glucose tolerance, and a potential risk for pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is on antibiotics for polymicrobial wound infection. There is a concern for underlying infection due to her immune-compromised state and pressure ulcers.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. IV fluids have been administered to improve kidney function.
3. Pressure Ulcers: The patient has developed pressure ulcers due to immobility and large pannus. These ulcers may lead to further complications such as infection or even underlying bowel involvement.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's obesity and right bundle branch block suggest a potential risk for pulmonary hypertension. Further evaluation is needed with an echo.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely related"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She presented with extensive wounds on the left side of her body, somnolence, and suspected cellulitis. She has been receiving antibiotics for a likely polymicrobial wound infection. The patient also has hypertension, acute kidney injury (ARF) resolved with IV fluids, altered mental status likely due to infection and dehydration, depression, hyponatremia resolving after IVF, elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels indicating possible low-grade rhabdomyolysis, impaired glucose tolerance, and a negative rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient's extensive wounds and leukocytosis suggest a possible cellulitis infection. If not properly managed, it can lead to worsening of the infection, abscess formation, or systemic spread.
2. Polymicrobial infection: The presence of large pannus and immobility increases the risk of a polymicrobial infection. If antibiotics are not effective, the infection may progress, leading to sepsis or septic shock.
3. Hypertension: The patient's overnight hypertension may be secondary to pain or essential hypertension. If left uncontrolled, it can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as stroke or heart attack.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with morbid obesity and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has extensive wounds on the left side of her body and is currently on antibiotics for a suspected polymicrobial infection. The depth of the ulcers is unclear due to large pannus and immobility. The patient has a history of neglect and is being seen by psychiatry. Her altered mental status is improving, likely secondary to infection and dehydration. She also has hypertension, which may be essential or pain-induced. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results are pending. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/40 mmHg to 171/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's weight is currently 197 kg, and she has received a total of 1,020 mL of fluids with an output of 2,420 mL. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal glucose level. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient has extensive wounds, and the depth of the ulcers is unclear. This could indicate cellulitis, which is a bacterial infection of"

- She was seen by psychiatry and there are concerns about neglect.
- Her ARF has resolved with IVFs, and her CK levels are trending down.
- She has hyponatremia that is resolving after IVF, and elevated CK levels due to low-grade rhabdo secondary to prolonged immobilization.
- She also has impaired glucose tolerance and is likely to have glucose intolerance.
- The patient's TTE shows moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and aortic root dilation.
- She has mild aortic regurgitation and thickened mitral valve leaflets without stenosis or prolapse.
- There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
- The patient's wounds are being managed with bedside debridement, and further discussion is needed regarding OR vs continued bed-side debridement.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension.
- She was admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues.
- She has extensive wounds on her left side, which may be due to cellulitis.
- The patient is currently on antibiotics for the wound infection.
- She also has hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
- Her kidney function is normal, but there are concerns about impaired glucose tolerance.
- The patient has been started on Celexa for depression.
- The patient's condition is stable, and she is ready for transfer to the floor with high-demand nursing needs.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Wound infection: The patient's extensive wounds increase the risk of infection. Since she is already on antibiotics, it is important to monitor her closely for any signs of worsening infection.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed and monitored regularly. If left uncontrolled, it can lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart attack or stroke.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: This condition can put strain on the heart and lungs. The patient should be monitored for any worsening symptoms and may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient may have impaired glucose tolerance or even undiagnosed diabetes. It is important to monitor her blood sugar levels and provide appropriate dietary advice and management.
5. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression, and it is important to monitor her mental health closely"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension admitted to the ICU with transient hypotension, lethargy, and pressure ulcers. The patient underwent debridement by plastics and is currently on antibiotics for a likely polymicrobial wound infection. The patient's blood culture from 1/3 and 1/4 is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial wound infection: The patient has necrotic pressure ulcers, and there is a concern for polymicrobial infection. Antibiotics have been initiated, but it is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
2. Hypertension: The patient was hypotensive in the ED, but overnight became hypertensive. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of hypertension, which could be due to pain or essential hypertension.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient has moderate pulmonary hypertension and a mildly dilated right ventricle on echocardiogram. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
4. Altered mental status: The patient initially presented with lethargy and altered mental status. This could be secondary to infection, dehydration, or depression. Improving mental status is noted, but ongoing psychiatric evaluation is required.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient had hyponatremia that resolved after IV fluids. Close monitoring of electrolyte balance is important.
6. Impaired glucose tolerance: The patient has impaired glucose"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is admitted to the MICU for transient hypotension, wound care, and nursing requirements. The patient has a history of cellulitis, decubitus ulcer, obesity, hypovolemia, depression, and alteration in nutrition. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/40 mmHg to 171/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, morphine sulfate, and others. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (15.0), hemoglobin (9.3 g/dL), and lactate (2.7 mmol/L). The patient has a high level of potassium (25 mEq/L) and low bicarbonate (19 mg/dL) levels. Imaging results from the trans-thoracic echo reveal a mildly dilated left atrium, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, right ventricular hypertrophy, dilated right ventricular cavity, mild aortic regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of cellulitis suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection that could lead to sepsis if not"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension admitted to the ICU with transient hypotension, lethargy, and pressure ulcers. The patient underwent debridement by plastics and is currently on antibiotics for a polymicrobial wound infection. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on [**2199-1-3**] and [**2199-1-4**]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial wound infection: The patient has necrotic pressure ulcers that are infected, and she is currently on antibiotics. It is important to continue monitoring the wound for any signs of worsening infection.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and was hypotensive in the ED, possibly due to morphine and dehydration. It is necessary to manage her blood pressure and prevent any further complications related to hypertension.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient initially presented with signs of ARF, but it has resolved with IV fluids. However, ongoing monitoring is required to ensure kidney function remains stable.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which is likely due to infection, dehydration, and depression. It is important to continue psychiatric evaluation and provide appropriate treatment for depression.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer present at admission, which requires ongoing wound care management to prevent further complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has extensive wounds on the left side of her body and is currently on antibiotics for a likely polymicrobial infection. The patient's white blood cell count is stable, indicating improvement from yesterday. The plan is to continue with vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam for the wound infection. Wound debridement is scheduled with plastics every other day, but the patient has not been seen by plastics yet today. TID dressing changes will be continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient has an extensive wound and is at risk for cellulitis, which is already present. Continuing antibiotics and wound care management is important to prevent further complications.
2. Polymicrobial infection: The patient's wound is likely infected with multiple types of bacteria, requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover all possible pathogens.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and was found to be hypertensive overnight. Long-term management of hypertension is necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has suspected pulmonary hypertension, possibly due to OSA. Further evaluation with an outpatient sleep study is recommended.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure but resolved with IV fluids. Monitoring kidney function and maintaining adequate hydration is crucial.
6. Depression: The patient"

   55 y o lady with morbid obesity and HTN, no recent medical care,
   admitted from home with FTT and somnolence, found to have extensive
   wound on L side of her body, in the ICU for nursing/wound care issues.
   1. Cellulitis: secondary to large pannus and immobility. Concern for
   polymicrobial infection w/ leukocytosis currently on antibiotics.
   Leukocytosis slowly improving, WBCs stable from yesterday.  CT abdomen
   unable to be obtained due to large body habitus.
   - Continue vanco/unasyn for likely polymicrobial wound infection
   - Follow vanco levels: recheck tomorrow
   - QOD wound debriedment with Plastics: to see patient again today.
   - TID dressing changes
   2.  Hypertension: was hypotensive in ED secondary to
   morphine/dehydration.  Hypertensive overnight likely secondary to pain,
   possibly essential hypertension.  Normal LV function on TTE.
   - Cont morphine/oxycodone/tylenol prn pain
   - Add BBL
   3. Pulmonary HTN: ?[**12-25**] OSA, off supplemental oxygen now.
   - Outpatient sleep study and other w/up

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has a history of extensive wound on her left side, and her current condition includes cellulitis secondary to large pannus and immobility. She is currently on antibiotics for a likely polymicrobial wound infection. Her vital signs show hypertension, and she also has right bundle branch block (RBBB) in her heart rhythm. The patient has impaired fasting glucose tolerance and is taking Celexa for depression. Her lab results indicate leukocytosis with stable WBC count, elevated creatinine levels, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Imaging tests include a CT abdomen that could not be obtained due to large body habitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient already has cellulitis, which is a bacterial infection of the skin and soft tissues. If not properly managed, it can progress and lead to more severe infections such as necrotizing fasciitis or sepsis.
2. Polymicrobial infection: The patient's extensive wound increases the risk of a polymicrobial infection, where multiple types of bacteria and other microorganisms can infect the wound. This can complicate treatment and increase the risk of treatment failure.
3. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be controlled to prevent complications like stroke, heart attack, or damage to organs.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension admitted to the ICU for transient hypotension, lethargy, and pressure ulcers. The patient has necrotic pressure ulcers, likely polymicrobial infection, and is currently on antibiotics. The patient's hypertension was initially hypotensive in the ED but became hypertensive overnight, possibly due to pain or essential hypertension. The patient also has acute renal failure, altered mental status (delirium secondary to infection and dehydration), depression, hyponatremia, elevated CK levels (low-grade rhabdo), impaired glucose tolerance, and malnutrition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pressure ulcers, development of a systemic infection, further renal impairment, exacerbation of depression, electrolyte imbalances, and worsening glycemic control."

","Summary:
The patient has been admitted to the ICU with skin wounds and a history of cellulitis, decubitus ulcer, obesity, hypovolemia, depression, and alteration in nutrition. They were started on antibiotics, including ampicillin/sulbactam, ampicillin, and vancomycin. The patient experienced an atrial irritability episode that led to a brief run of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with tachycardia and hypertension. The nursing team believes the patient would benefit from beta blockade. The patient's vital signs show elevated blood pressure and heart rate within normal limits. The patient's weight is currently 197 kg, and they have received a total of 2,720 mL of fluids in the past 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, decreased platelet count, increased creatinine level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery, and their ABG results indicate a respiratory acidosis. Physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other parameters. The patient's medical history includes depression and a decubitus ulcer present at admission. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications. The patient's disposition is still pending.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues related to cellulitis and a decubitus ulcer. The patient also has a history of depression and altered nutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cellulitis: The patient has an ongoing infection in her wound, which may lead to worsening cellulitis if not properly managed. Antibiotics are currently being administered, but close monitoring for signs of infection and wound healing is necessary.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and her blood pressure readings indicate that she is hypertensive. It is important to monitor her blood pressure regularly and adjust medication as needed to control her hypertension.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which could be related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Further evaluation with an outpatient sleep study is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate management.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient had signs of acute renal failure, but it has resolved with IV fluids. Close monitoring of renal function is essential to detect any future episodes of ARF.

5. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, and psychiatric follow-up is planned. It is important to continue monitoring her mental health and provide appropriate support and treatment.

6. Impaired Glucose Tolerance: The patient has impaired glucose"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has a history of depression, cellulitis, and decubitus ulcer (present at admission). The patient's current conditions include necrotic pressure ulcers, likely polymicrobial wound infection, hypertension/tachycardia, acute renal failure (resolved with IVFs), altered mental status (improved with treatment of infection and dehydration), depression (RPR negative, TSH wnl), impaired glucose tolerance, and pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to her compromised immune system and the presence of necrotic pressure ulcers. Proper wound care and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and obesity increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium have been initiated, but close monitoring is necessary.
3. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia need to be managed carefully to prevent complications like myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias. Medications like metoprolol should be continued.
4. Respiratory Issues: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and possible obstructive sleep apnea require further evaluation. Outpatient sleep study and other workups should be done.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has a history of depression, cellulitis, and decubitus ulcer present at admission. She is currently being treated for necrotic pressure ulcers, likely polymicrobial wound infection, and hypertension/tachycardia. The patient's altered mental status is improving but may still be secondary to infection and dehydration. She is also experiencing impaired glucose tolerance and pulmonary hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of cellulitis and necrotic pressure ulcers, which suggests a high risk of infection. The presence of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and symptoms such as pain, redness, and warmth at the wound site could indicate an ongoing or worsening infection.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to the patient's immobility and obesity, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Symptoms may include swelling, pain, warmth, and redness in the affected leg.
3. Pressure Ulcer Progression: The patient already has necrotic pressure ulcers, which can worsen if not properly managed. This may lead to deeper tissue damage, infection, or even bone involvement.
4. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient's high blood pressure and tachycard"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has extensive wounds on the left side of her body and is being treated for cellulitis, likely caused by polymicrobial infection. The patient's leukocytosis is slowly improving, and she is currently on antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a history of FTT (failure to thrive), somnolence, and impaired glucose tolerance. She also has a possible case of pulmonary hypertension, depression, and acute renal failure, which has resolved with IV fluids. The patient's current medications include Unasyn, Vancomycin, Heparin, Colace, Metoprolol, Oxycodone, and Celexa.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is already being treated for cellulitis and has a risk of developing further infections due to her polymicrobial wound infection.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's risk of pulmonary embolism is increased due to potential DVT and her morbid obesity.
4. Wound dehiscence: The patient's extensive wound needs proper care and management to prevent wound dehiscence.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and obesity"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has extensive wounds on her left side, and is currently being treated for cellulitis secondary to a large pannus and immobility. The patient also has cardiovascular issues, including hypotension in the ED and subsequent hypertension, possibly related to pain or essential hypertension. She has normal LV function on TTE and her cardiac enzymes were negative twice during admission. The patient experienced a supraventricular tachycardia episode yesterday, which resolved on BBL. She also has pulmonary hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, for which an outpatient sleep study is recommended. The patient had acute renal failure that resolved with IV fluids, and her CK trended down. She has depression, and psychiatry follow-up has been initiated. The patient is also diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance and is on a PO diet with glycemic control measures. She has a PICC line in place, and prophylactic heparin is being administered for DVT prevention. The patient's current status is stable, and she is awaiting transfer to the floor. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Wound infection: The patient's extensive wounds are at risk of developing a wound infection due to the presence of cellulitis. Continuous monitoring of the wounds and appropriate antibiotic therapy should help prevent or manage any potential infection.
2. Cardiovascular issues: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues related to extensive wounds on her left side. She has been in the ICU for an unknown duration. The patient has a history of cellulitis secondary to large pannus and immobility, and is currently on antibiotics for a polymicrobial wound infection. Her white blood cell count is slowly improving. She also has cardiovascular issues, including hypotension in the emergency department, hypertension, and a recent episode of supraventricular tachycardia. The cardiac enzymes are negative. The patient has pulmonary hypertension and is scheduled for an outpatient sleep study. She also has acute renal failure, which has resolved with intravenous fluids, and impaired glucose tolerance. The patient is being treated for depression and is on medication for it. She is expected to be stable for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient has extensive wounds that are at risk of developing a wound infection due to the polymicrobial nature of the infection. It is important to monitor her temperature, white blood cell count, and wound healing progress closely.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile and obese, she is at an increased risk of developing DVT. She is on prophylactic heparin subcutaneously to reduce this risk.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has an extensive wound on the left side of her body and is currently being treated for cellulitis, secondary to a large pannus and immobility. The patient's leukocytosis has improved from admission, and she is on antibiotics for a likely polymicrobial wound infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient's extensive wound on the left side of her body has led to cellulitis, which is a bacterial infection of the skin and tissues beneath the skin. If left untreated, it can spread and cause more severe infections.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and her blood pressure readings have shown fluctuations between hypotension and hypertension. It is important to monitor and manage her blood pressure to prevent complications such as heart attack or stroke.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient may have pulmonary hypertension, possibly due to sleep apnea. This condition puts additional strain on the heart and can lead to right-sided heart failure if not managed properly.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, but it has since resolved with intravenous fluids. It is essential to continue monitoring her kidney function to prevent any further renal complications.
5. Depression: The patient has been diagnosed with depression, and appropriate psychiatric care is being provided. Proper"

- She is on a prophylactic anticoagulant for deep vein thrombosis and has a PICC line in place.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is stable for discharge to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an active infection due to cellulitis/panniculitis, and there is a risk of developing further infections if proper wound care and antibiotic therapy are not maintained.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia/SVT: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may continue to pose a risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
3. Depression: The patient has been evaluated for depression, and it is important to continue monitoring her mental health status to prevent worsening of symptoms and potential self-neglect.
4. Pulmonary HTN/OSA: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea require further evaluation and management to prevent respiratory complications.
5. Impaired Glucose Tolerance: The patient has impaired glucose tolerance, which could lead to the development of diabetes mellitus if not properly managed.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status needs to be closely monitored to ensure she receives adequate vitamins and minerals for wound healing and overall health.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and other risk factors. Prophylactic anticoagulation should be continued to prevent clot formation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old lady with morbid obesity and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has pressure ulcers on the left side of her body and was found to have somnolence. The patient is currently being treated for cellulitis/panniculitis with necrotic ulcerations, suspected polymicrobial infection. She is also being treated for hypertension/tachycardia/SVT, depression, pulmonary hypertension, acute renal failure, altered mental status, impaired glucose tolerance, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's wound is infected, and she is being treated for a polymicrobial infection. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and presence of central venous catheters.
3. Pneumonia: Given the patient's pulmonary hypertension and impaired respiratory function, there is a risk of developing pneumonia, especially if proper respiratory support is not maintained.
4. Wound Healing Complications: The patient's pressure ulcers have necrotic ulcerations, and proper wound care is essential to prevent further complications such as worsening ulcers, osteomyelitis, or fasciitis.
5. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has hypertension and tachycardia, which require close monitoring"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with morbid obesity and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for nursing/wound care issues. She has extensive wounds on the left side of her body and is currently being treated with antibiotics for a suspected polymicrobial infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 130/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. 

The patient has a history of impaired fasting glucose tolerance and is receiving insulin infusion for glycemic control. Her lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 0.5-1.3 mg/dL, and a troponin T level of 0.01. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include cellulitis/panniculitis secondary to large pannus and immobility, with a concern for polymicrobial infection. She is currently on ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) for the wound infection and will have daily wound debridement with plastics. 

The patient also has hypertension/tachycardia, possibly secondary to pain or essential hypertension. Cardiac enzymes are negative, and she has normal left ventricular function on transthoracic echocardi"
