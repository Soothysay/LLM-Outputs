   85 yo female with hx of CAD (with NSTEMI post ERCP), COPD on home O2,
   apspiration PNA who was recently discharged home and is now re-admitted
   with increasing hypoxemia in the setting of hyptertension at home now
   with new NSTEMI
   > Hypoxemia: likely CHF/CAD in setting of severe HTN (syst dysfunction
   elevated BNP); in addition may have PNA (dry cough, fever) and
   component of chronic COPD. Finally she has what looks like an increase
   in left sided effusion (although on the abdominal cuts of a previous CT
   there was no effusion). Will obtain a Chest CT today, will use theTTE
   to help guide whether it should be PE protocol, if there are signs of
   RV impairment then will pursue PE-CT
   -Continue diuresis (TBB goal even to net neg 500 cc)
   - Brief course of PO prednisone 40 mg PO x 5 days Day 1 = [**12-31**].
   - CT scan
   -Repeat ECHO  [**12-31**] given concern for evolving infarct
   -bronchodilators
   -Levoflox/Flagyl continued post ERCP x 7 day course, will await the
   results of CT scan to decide on whether we need to cont course for
   aspiration.
   > NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia, but she clearly has CAD with a new
   troponin rise on this admission concerning for a second  NSTEMI again
   in the setting of demand. Appreciate cardiology input. She may go to
   the cath lab for re-vascularization.
   -Continue ASA, plavix, heparin, ACE-I,  statin, BB for HR 50-60.
   Notably no previous coronary cath.
   - repeat TTE
   > Fever: PNA?, LLE cellulitis?, viral infection?, U/A is normal,
   LFT/Lip normal. She has remained Afebrile since her admission.
   -Continue levaquin/flagyl as above
   -Vanco for ? cellulitis
   -Follow up clx data.
    .> Lower ext swelling: appears to be consistent with cellulitis.There
   is no evidence of DVT on LENI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was recently discharged home. She presents with increasing hypoxemia, hypertension, and a new non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient also shows signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), possibly pneumonia (PNA), chronic COPD, and an increase in left-sided pleural effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels can be attributed to CHF, CAD, severe hypertension, PNA, and chronic COPD. Treatment should focus on addressing these underlying conditions.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's recent troponin rise indicates myocardial ischemia, likely due to demand ischemia or a second NSTEMI. Immediate cardiology input is required, and the patient may need revascularization.
3. CHF: The patient exhibits symptoms consistent with CHF, such as systolic dysfunction and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Diuretics should be continued to manage fluid balance.
4. PNA: The patient displays signs of infection, including fever, dry cough, and potential aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics should be continued, and further evaluation with a chest CT scan is necessary.
5. Left-sided pleural effusion: The increasing effusion could indicate worsening heart failure or an alternative"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). She was recently discharged home but is now readmitted with increasing hypoxemia, new non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and a possible left-sided pleural effusion. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, edema, and erythema on the left calf. Her vital signs are stable, but she has elevated blood pressure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels, as well as slightly low platelet count. Imaging studies reveal a left-sided pleural effusion, which was not present on a previous CT scan. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of crackles and wheezing in the lungs, along with hypoxemia, suggest a possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of edema and erythema on the left calf raises concerns for DVT. If left untreated, it can lead to pulmonary embolism, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.

3. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and new NSTEMI, there is an increased risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. Close monitoring and appropriate cardiac support are necessary.

4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, likely secondary to PNA or cellulitis. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is crucial.

5. Pleural Effusion: The increasing left-sided pleural effusion requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. If infected, it can lead to empyema, which may necessitate drainage procedures.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's clinical status and promptly address any potential complications to ensure optimal management and improve outcomes."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU for increasing hypoxemia, hypertension, and new-onset non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has been treated with diuretics, prednisone, and antibiotics for potential pneumonia and left lower extremity cellulitis. The patient's condition is complicated by congestive heart failure (CHF), acute kidney injury, COPD exacerbation, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). Further diagnostic tests, including a chest CT scan, repeat echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization, are planned to guide treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of hypoxemia, hypertension, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) suggest worsening heart failure. Fluid overload and inadequate diuretic dosing could worsen her condition.
2. PE: The increasing left-sided effusion on chest X-ray and clinical suspicion may indicate a possible PE. If confirmed, this could significantly impact the patient's prognosis and treatment plan.
3. NSTEMI: The new rise in troponin levels indicates ongoing myocardial ischemia. Prompt intervention is necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and current symptoms of dyspnea and hypox"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with hx of CAD (with NSTEMI post ERCP), COPD on home O2,
   apspiration PNA who was recently discharged home and is now re-admitted
   with increasing hypoxemia in the setting of hyptertension at home now
   with new NSTEMI
   > Hypoxemia: likely CHF/CAD in setting of severe HTN (syst dysfunction
   elevated BNP); in addition may have PNA (dry cough, fever) and
   component of chronic COPD. Finally she has what looks like an increase
   in left sided effusion (although on the abdominal cuts of a previous CT
   there was no effusion). Will obtain a Chest CT today, will use theTTE
   to help guide whether it should be PE protocol, if there are signs of
   RV impairment then will pursue PE-CT
   -Continue diuresis (TBB goal even to net neg 500 cc)
   - Brief course of PO prednisone 40 mg PO x 5 days Day 1 = [**12-31**].
   - CT scan
   -Repeat ECHO  [**12-31**] given concern for evolving infarct
   -bronchodilators
   -Levoflox/Flagyl continued post ERCP x 7 day course, will await the
   results of CT scan to decide on whether we need to cont course for
   aspiration.
   > NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia, but she clearly has CAD with a new
   troponin rise on this admission concerning for a second  NSTEMI again
   in the setting of demand. Appreciate cardiology input. She may go to
   the cath lab for re-vascularization.
   -Continue ASA, plavix, heparin, ACE-I,  statin, BB for HR 50-60.
   Notably no previous coronary cath.
   - repeat TTE
   > Fever: PNA?, LLE cellulitis?, viral infection?, U/A is normal,
   LFT/Lip normal. She has remained Afebrile since her admission.
   -Continue levaquin/flagyl as above
   -Vanco for ? cellulitis
   -Follow up clx data.
    .> Lower ext swelling: appears to be consistent with cellulitis.There
   is no evidence of DVT on LENI.
   - cont vanco for cellulitis

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). She was recently discharged but is now readmitted with increasing hypoxemia, new non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and a possible left-sided pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 130/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Physical examination findings include crackles and diffuse wheezing in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and marked edema with erythema on the left calf. Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and troponin T. Chest X-ray shows an increasing left-sided effusion. The assessment and plan include possible congestive heart failure (CHF), acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), NSTEMI, pneumonia, and cellulitis. The patient is on diuretics, prednisone, antibiotics, and bronchodilators. Further tests such as a chest CT scan, repeat echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization are planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, respiratory failure, infection (such as pneumonia or cellulitis), deep vein thrombosis (D"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 F with COPD on home O2, recent admission to hospital for post-ERCP
   hypoxia thought related to NSTEMI and aspiration pneumonia, now
   admitted with worsening dyspnea, elevated troponin, and pulmonary
   edema.
   # Hypoxemia.  Desat during past admission as per HPI thought due to
   pneumonia, NSTEMI, heart failure.  Now returns with worsening of
   dyspnea and increased O2 requirement.  Occurred suddenly.  Differential
   includes ACS, worsening or new pneumonia, volume overload, PE, COPD
   flare.  New infarct less likely in absence of chest pain, ECG changes,
   and very low CK (though troponin has increased).  Does have pulm edema
   on CXR and exam - due to acute cardiac ischemia vs. other cause for
   volume overload.  PE also needs to be considered, in light of recent
   procedure/hospitalization and conjugated estrogen use.
   - ACS meds: heparin gtt, continue BB, [**Month/Year (2) 1167**], [**Month/Year (2) 68**].  Increase statin to
   80 mg daily.
   - cycle enzymes.
   - given above history, will likely need further eval for PE.  Will
   check Ddimer; if negative (though seems unlikely to be) will be
   comfortable with negative eval; if positive would probably pursue VQ
   scan vs. CTA vs. TTE.  On heparin gtt tonight in any case.  Hold
   estrogen for short and probably long term.
   - Serial ECGs.
   - For volume overload component; will need further diuresis - 40 IV
   lasix tonight and monitor I/O.
   # NSTEMI.  With worsening troponin as above.
   - Cards aware; consult in AM.
   - Heparin gtt, BB, [**Last Name (LF) 1167**], [**First Name3 (LF) 68**], statin as above.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, acute on chronic.  Recent echo with EF
   40-45% and focal HK, likely CAD/infarct related.  BNP elevated (no
   priors) and CXR with edema and effusion.
   - 40 IV lasix tonight; goal 1-2 L negative over next 24 hours.
   - continue BB and ACEI.
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonia.  Discharged on levo/flagyl with concern for
   aspiration on past imaging.  Passed speech and swallow last admission.
   Fever at OSH to 102.7.
   - Continue levoflox/flagyl, continue vanco (started in ED).
   - management of possible effusion below.
   .
   # Fever. To 102.7 in ED.  Recent ERCP though abdomen benign.  ALso
   treated for aspiration pneumonia.
   - check blood cultures, urine culture.
   - c.diff given diarrhea (though on flagyl).
   - sputum if able
   - check LFTs and lipase.
   - antibiotics as above - levo flagyl, vanco
   .
   # Pleural effusion: L side with moderate effusion, with ?of underlying
   consolidation/aspiration - ?parapneumonic effusion.  However, less
   impressive on CT from [**12-28**] compared with CXR.
   - diuresis tonight.
   - will discuss thoracentesis tonight or in AM (if large enough
 u/s
   vs. lateral decub film).
   .
   # COPD.  On home O2.
   - continue home regimen: A/A MDI, fluticasone MDI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, recent hospital admission for post-ERCP hypoxia thought related to NSTEMI and aspiration pneumonia, and now admitted with worsening dyspnea, elevated troponin, and pulmonary edema. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypoxemia, NSTEMI, congestive heart failure (acute on chronic), aspiration pneumonia, fever, pleural effusion, COPD, and diarrhea. The patient's current treatment plan includes heparin gtt, beta-blockers, statin, diuretics, antibiotics, and pain management. The patient is currently in the ICU with ongoing monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels can lead to inadequate oxygenation of tissues and organs, potentially causing respiratory distress and organ damage.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's elevated troponin levels indicate a potential heart attack, which can lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and even death.
3. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) suggest heart failure. This can result in fluid accumulation, decreased cardiac output, and organ dysfunction.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and recent pneumonia increases the risk of recurrent aspiration events, leading to worsening lung infections and respiratory failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted to the ICU for worsening dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI and aspiration pneumonia. There are concerns for reinfarct and other potential complications such as hypoxemia, volume overload, pulmonary embolism, or exacerbation of COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's dyspnea and pulmonary edema can lead to inadequate oxygenation.
2. Worsening or new pneumonia: The patient's recent admission for post-ERCP hypoxia and previous aspiration pneumonia increase the risk of pneumonia exacerbation or development of a new infection.
3. Volume overload: The patient's pulmonary edema and fluid balance indicate possible fluid overload, which can worsen heart failure symptoms.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's recent immobilization and risk factors like COPD and NSTEMI increase the risk of PE.
5. COPD flare: The patient's underlying COPD can worsen due to the current illness and treatment interventions.
6. Reinfarct: The elevated cardiac enzymes suggest ongoing myocardial injury, raising concerns for reinfarction.
7. Pleural effusion: The patient has a moderate effusion on CXR, which may worsen and require further evaluation or intervention.

The differential diagnosis includes acute chest syndrome (ACS), worsening or new pneumonia, volume overload, pulmonary embolism (PE), and COPD flare. Treatment includes heparin infusion, continuation of beta-blockers, increased statin dosage, and possible cardiac catheterization.

2. NSTEMI: The patient's increasing troponins and CK levels suggest a possible reinfarction. Treatment includes cardiac follow-up with possible catheterization, heparin infusion, beta-blockers, and increased statin dosage.

3. Congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: The patient's recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% and focal hypertrophy, likely due to coronary artery disease or infarction-related. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, and chest X-ray shows edema and effusion. Treatment includes diuresis with 40 mg IV lasix, continuation of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, and repeat"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of COPD and recent hospital admission for post-ERCP hypoxia, thought to be related to NSTEMI and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is now admitted with worsening dyspnea, elevated troponin, and pulmonary edema. The patient's medical history includes COPD, possible cellulitis on the left lower extremity, neuropathy of unclear etiology, and recent fever. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's main concern is dyspnea and hypoxia. Differential diagnosis includes ACS, worsening or new pneumonia, volume overload, PE, and COPD flare. The patient is already on heparin for ACS, and diuretics have been started for volume overload. PO steroids have also been initiated for a COPD flare.

2. NSTEMI: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating a possible NSTEMI. Cardiology recommendations include following up with a stress test as an outpatient and continuing with beta blockers and statin therapy.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has shown signs of acute on chronic CHF with pulmonary edema and an ejection fraction (EF) of 40-45%. However, the recent echo showed a normal EF without focal abnormalities. Diuretics have been prescribed to manage fluid overload.

4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration and was discharged"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged male with a chief complaint of dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic pain, and myocardial infarction. He is currently admitted to the ICU.

The note mentions several events that have occurred over the past 24 hours. An EKG was performed at 08:23 AM, which showed no new abnormalities. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) was also done to assess for new onset of heart failure given the elevated BNP and findings of failure. The TTE revealed no new abnormalities.

A barium swallow was recommended to rule out esophageal pathology, likely reflux, and re-consult was suggested if the scan is negative. The patient was started on IV diuresis with lasix 40mg in the morning, but it did not result in any net output. The cardiology team recommended considering a cardiac catheterization when the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) quiet down, and maximizing medical therapy. It was also mentioned that the cardiology consult would be done overnight.

A CT scan performed at 8pm showed small bilateral pleural effusions, smooth septal thickening, and a ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the dependent portion of the lungs. These findings are suggestive of pulmonary edema, although the pattern is somewhat atypical, raising the"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with hx of CAD (with NSTEMI post ERCP), COPD on home O2,
   apspiration PNA who was recently discharged home and is now re-admitted
   with increasing hypoxemia in the setting of hyptertension at home now
   with new NSTEMI
   > Hypoxemia: likely CHF/CAD in setting of severe HTN (syst dysfunction
   elevated BNP); in addition may have PNA (dry cough, fever) and
   component of chronic COPD. The left sided process has improved and
   appears to be consistent with at least in part with pericardial fat
   pad. Her wheezes have improved dramatically  whether this is improving
   COPD (now  on steroids) vs improving volume status is not clear.
   -Continue diuresis (TBB goal even to net neg 500 cc)
   - Brief course of PO prednisone 40 mg PO x 5 days Day 1 = [**12-31**].
   -bronchodilators
   -Levoflox/Flagyl: complete 10 day course (will change flagyl to clinda
   to cover skin infection)
   > NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia, but she clearly has CAD with a new
   troponin rise on this admission concerning for a second  NSTEMI again
   in the setting of demand. Appreciate cardiology input. She may go to
   the cath lab for re-vascularization. Interestingly her TTE from [**12-31**]
   showed normal EF with no wall motion abnormalities. Will discuss with
   Cardiology re: further intervention.  Notably her troponins have cont
   to improve.
   -Continue ASA, plavix, heparin, ACE-I,  statin, BB for HR 50-60.
   Notably no previous coronary cath.
    > Fever: PNA?, LLE cellulitis, U/A is normal, LFT/Lip normal. Her resp
   viral panel was neg.. Would favor completing a course of treatment for
   cellulitis as she appears to have improved over the last 24 hrs on
   Vanco, will change to clindamycin
   -Continue levaquin/
   -Change Vanco to clindamycin for skin coverage.
   -Follow up clx data.
   > Lower ext swelling: appears to be consistent with cellulitis.There is
   no evidence of DVT on LENI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was recently discharged but readmitted due to increasing hypoxemia, hypertension, and a new non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA), cellulitis in her left lower extremity (LLE), and pericardial effusion. The patient's condition has shown improvement over the past 24 hours, with reduced wheezing, improved oxygen saturation, and decreasing left-sided pleural effusion. However, she still requires further management for her NSTEMI, PNA, and cellulitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels have risen, indicating a possible second NSTEMI. This requires immediate attention from cardiology, and she may undergo revascularization procedures.
2. PNA: Although the respiratory viral panel was negative, the patient has symptoms consistent with pneumonia. Continued treatment with antibiotics is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Cellulitis: The patient's lower extremity swelling and skin changes are indicative of cellulitis. Changing the antibiotic to clindamycin and completing the course of treatment is recommended to prevent worsening of the infection.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate respiratory distress. Monitoring and providing supplemental oxygen as needed are essential to maintain adequate oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with hx of CAD (with NSTEMI post ERCP), COPD on home O2,
   apspiration PNA who was recently discharged home and is now re-admitted
   with increasing hypoxemia in the setting of hyptertension at home now
   with new NSTEMI
   > Hypoxemia: likely CHF/CAD in setting of severe HTN (syst dysfunction
   elevated BNP); in addition may have PNA (dry cough, fever) and
   component of chronic COPD. The left sided process has improved and
   appears to be consistent with at least in part with pericardial fat
   pad. Her wheezes have improved dramatically  whether this is improving
   COPD (now  on steroids) vs improving volume status is not clear.
   -Continue diuresis (TBB goal even to net neg 500 cc)
   - Brief course of PO prednisone 40 mg PO x 5 days Day 1 = [**12-31**].
   -bronchodilators
   -Levoflox/Flagyl: complete 10 day course (will change flagyl to clinda
   to cover skin infection)
   > NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia, but she clearly has CAD with a new
   troponin rise on this admission concerning for a second  NSTEMI again
   in the setting of demand. Appreciate cardiology input. She may go to
   the cath lab for re-vascularization. Interestingly her TTE from [**12-31**]
   showed normal EF with no wall motion abnormalities. Will discuss with
   Cardiology re: further intervention.  Notably her troponins have cont
   to improve.
   -Continue ASA, plavix, heparin, ACE-I,  statin, BB for HR 50-60.
   Notably no previous coronary cath.
    > Fever: PNA?, LLE cellulitis, U/A is normal, LFT/Lip normal. Her resp
   viral panel was neg.. Would favor completing a course of treatment for
   cellulitis as she appears to have improved over the last 24 hrs on
   Vanco, will change to clindamycin
   -Continue levaquin/
   -Change Vanco to clindamycin for skin coverage.
   -Follow up clx data.
   > Lower ext swelling: appears to be consistent with cellulitis.There is
   no evidence of DVT on LENI.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). She was recently discharged home but is now readmitted due to increasing hypoxemia and a new non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current condition shows improvement in wheezing and decreased left-sided pleural effusion compared to previous findings. However, she still has crackles at the lung bases and diminished breath sounds. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/39 mmHg to 157/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and troponin T. Her electrolytes show normal sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-) levels, but slightly low calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++) levels. The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are elevated, as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
