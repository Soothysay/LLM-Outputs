","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, COPD, bradycardia, coronary artery disease, depression, gastroparesis, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient was admitted to the MICU with complaints of abdominal pain and was found to have sepsis and gram-negative bacteremia. He has been receiving antibiotics and vasopressor support. The patient also has a diabetic foot wound with ascending infection and wet gangrene in his right foot. An amputation is planned as definitive treatment. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, indicating renal dysfunction and ongoing sepsis. Imaging reveals a large thrombus in the right internal jugular vein and no fluid collection in the left fistula. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin, norepinephrine, haloperidol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and rising trend indicate ongoing sepsis despite antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of further deterioration in his condition if sepsis is not adequately controlled.
2. Diabetic Foot Wound Infection: The presence of wet gangrene in the right foot suggests an ascending infection from the diabetic foot wound. Without appropriate surgical intervention, there is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and presents with several medical complications. The patient has a history of sepsis with organ dysfunction, gangrene, and suspected gentamicin nephrotoxicity. They also have a right internal jugular (RIJ) clot and are on heparin therapy. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturation. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, low total carbon dioxide, and elevated blood glucose levels. The coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and an elevated international normalized ratio. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase levels.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and abdominal pain. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, insulin, and medications for blood pressure control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, development of further organ dysfunction, complications related to the RIJ clot, and potential contrast-induced nephropathy from radiologic procedures.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of their critical illness, sepsis, and associated complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of gangrene and sepsis. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently being treated for multiple medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and heart rate. They are also experiencing respiratory distress and have a decreased oxygen saturation level. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and signs of kidney dysfunction. They are receiving various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, insulin, and renal replacement therapy. The patient's pain is being managed with morphine, and they are also receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's condition is serious, and they require close monitoring and further medical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's current condition and the presence of organ dysfunction, there is a possibility of MODS, where multiple organs fail due to inadequate perfusion and oxygenation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels suggest impaired renal function, which can lead to AKI if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and abnormal arterial blood gas values indicate respiratory distress, and they may require mechanical ventilation to support"

   Microbiology: GNRs in blood not yet speciated
   Assessment and Plan
   55-year-old woman with septic shock and gram negative bacteremia in the
   setting of severe peripheral vascular disease and gangrene.  Although
   blood pressure has improved, lactate has increased and foot looks
   worse.  Although she might certainly have ischemic colitis as well (she
   has a history of this), the leg is an obvious source.  Given the
   progressive worsening of her leg examination, and the marked increase
   in lactate in spite of adequate blood pressure, I think the risks of
   delaying amputation at this point outweigh the benefits of further
   elucidation of whether there might be a component of ischemic colitis.
   Discussed with patient
s daughter [**Name (NI) 10400**], and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who
   agrees.
   We will give vancomycin, gentamicin, and meropenem for presumptive
   polymicrobial foot infection/gangrene, while awaiting speciation of
   cultures.  Continue levophed for shock.  Hold fluids for now as seems
   volume replete.
   Will need dialysis today for ESRD.
   Direct signout given to anesthesia and surgery for O.R. care in this
   complex patient.
   On heparin for IJ thrombus; held now just prior to the OR (discussed
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and anesthesia)
   Discussed with daughter [**Name (NI) 10400**] by phone and in person.
   Will return to MICU for further care after operation, with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s service following closely.  Suspect she may return quite
   ill.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with septic shock, gram-negative bacteremia, severe peripheral vascular disease, and gangrene. The patient's condition is critical, and several potential medical complications can arise.

1. Ischemic Colitis: The patient has a history of ischemic colitis, which may contribute to her symptoms. This condition involves reduced blood flow to the colon, leading to inflammation and injury.

2. Infection: The patient has a polymicrobial foot infection/gangrene, for which she is receiving antibiotics (vancomycin, gentamicin, and meropenem). It is crucial to monitor her response to these medications and watch out for any signs of worsening infection.

3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and will require dialysis today. Additionally, her elevated lactate levels indicate possible organ dysfunction, specifically in the liver or tissues.

4. Thrombus: The patient is on heparin for an inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus. This indicates a blood clot in the large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart. Monitoring for any signs of pulmonary embolism or further clot formation is necessary.

5. Surgical Intervention: The patient is scheduled for an operation, likely an amputation of the affected leg due to gangrene. Surgical complications such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to anesthesia are potential risks"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events are not clearly stated in the note. However, there are several significant events and interventions mentioned:

1. The patient underwent surgery (OR SENT) and received invasive ventilation (INVASIVE VENTILATION - START) on 2193-08-27 at 10:30 AM and 12:00 PM, respectively. The patient was intubated during the surgery. There was a brief period of extubation and reintubation (INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP at 04:01 PM), but the patient required ongoing respiratory support.

2. A multi-lumen line was placed (MULTI LUMEN - START) on 2193-08-27 at 12:00 PM. This line may be used for various purposes such as administration of fluids, medications, and monitoring of pressures.

3. The patient had a percutaneous catheterization line (PICC LINE) inserted, which was eventually stopped (PICC LINE - STOP) on 2193-08-27 at 07:53 PM. The line was used for the administration of medications, including antibiotics.

4. The patient underwent renal replacement therapy (HD) with removal of 0.5 kg of fluid. This suggests that the patient had significant fluid overload or renal dysfunction.

5. The patient experienced bleeding episodes, leading"

   enlargement
   of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion or
   pleural
   effusion. The right costophrenic angle has been excluded from the
   image.
   There is thickening of the minor fissure, which could be a
   manifestation of
   pleural effusion on the right.
   The right PICC line again does not appear to extend into the
   hemithorax.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Sepsis & GNR Bacteremia: Day 2 of vanc/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/gent, lactate has risen
   despite 2L fluid thought [**12-31**] to right foot wet gangrene
   -d/c cipro
   - OR today with vascular
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 430**]/gent/cipro
   - trend lactate, has risen 2.8 to 7.7
   - vasopressor support for MAP>55
   # Diabetic Foot wound
   - ascending infection, plan for amputation as definitive treatment
   today in OR
   # Abdominal Pain: no rebound/rigidty
   -consider intra-abdominal ischemia if not improving after OR today
   # Hyperkalemia: K now elevated to 5.9; dialysis neede given mental
   status and concern for sepsis.
   - insulin and dextrose
   - kayexelate if NG access can be obtained
   - calcium gluconate based on widening qrs in ecg
   -dialysis after OR today
   # RIJ Clot. Potential source being PICC line catheter, though not fully
   investigated there. There is RIJ clot however.
   -   Will anticoagulate with heparin for clot, given that there is no
   evidence of recent clots seen.
   -   Surgery aware, holding heparin to restart after OR
   #. Diabetes: Continue RISS. Pt not aware of current re
   - follow fingersticks ; only obtaining sliding scale now
   - diabetic/renal diet
   #. ESRD on HD: HD on T, Th, Sat
   -   dialysis today planned provisionally today.
   - ideally would do cvvh, needs access.
   # Agitation: QTc <500, can do trials of PRN Haldol.
   #. HTN: Hold BP meds for now
   #. COPD: bipap if necessary.
   #. Bradycardia: holding beta blocker
   #. CAD:
   - continue simvastatin, ASA
   - hold bblocker as hypotensive
   #. OSA: cpap at night.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of diabetes, ESRD on HD, and CAD, who presented to the ICU with sepsis and GNR bacteremia. The patient underwent amputation of the right below-knee due to diabetic foot wound with ascending infection. He also had an abdominal pain assessment with no rebound or rigidity, considering intra-abdominal ischemia if not improving after OR today. The patient's hyperkalemia required dialysis needed given mental status and concern for sepsis. He was found to have a right internal jugular vein (RIJ) clot, potentially due to the PICC line catheter. The patient will be anticoagulated with heparin for the clot. Other medical conditions include hypertension, COPD, bradycardia, CAD, gastroparesis, depression, and OSA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis and GNR bacteremia: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis and bacteremia, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Right internal jugular vein (RIJ) clot: The presence of an RIJ clot increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Diabetic foot wound with ascending infection: If left untreated, the infection"

   CXR [**8-26**]
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-22**], the nasogastric tube
   extends
   into the stomach, passed the bottom edge of the image. There is
   enlargement
   of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion or
   pleural
   effusion. The right costophrenic angle has been excluded from the
   image.
   There is thickening of the minor fissure, which could be a
   manifestation of
   pleural effusion on the right.
   The right PICC line again does not appear to extend into the
   hemithorax.
   U/S [**8-26**]:
   FINDINGS: Limited ultrasound of the right internal jugular and
   subclavian
   veins was performed at the request of the ordering provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is
   thrombus in the right internal jugular vein. The PICC line is seen in
   the
   right subclavian vein.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ vein thrombus.
   Assessment and Plan
   # Sepsis & GNR Bacteremia: Day 2 of vanc/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/gent, lactate has risen
   despite 2L fluid thought [**12-31**] to right foot wet gangrene
   Despite her amputation and antimicrobial coverage for her GNR
   bacteremia, she remains persistently septic and hypotensive. INR rising
   is suggestive of DIC. Her abdominal pain, though this has been a
   chronic characteristic of her course of late, raises the possibility of
   c. difficile infection that merits empiric coverage for now.
   Her central venous O2 sat returned 90% suggesting this is primarily
   sepsis mediated rather can cardiogenic.
   Echo tech is at bedside to better evaluate for effusion, RV failure or
   new wall motion abnormality.
   Given DIC/bleeding risk, we have discussed and will not empirically add
   activated protein C to her regimen. Additionally, given that this is
   likely infectious mediated with concern for abdominal process, will
   defer empiric corticosteroids for now.
   - increase meropenem to 1000mg IV daily
   - continue/redose IV vancomycin given level of 11
   - redose gentamicin
   - trending lactate
   - vasopressor support to maximal levels
   - CTA abdomen, as well as chest for ruling out acute thrombotic events
   to the messentary or the pulmonary vasculature. This is ordered, though
   travel outside of the MICU bears risk given her instability.

    Will increase rate to help counteract metabolic acidosis.
   # Abdominal Pain: no rebound/rigidty though given ESRD, she may not be
   able to mount full peritoneal signs.
   -consider intra-abdominal ischemia if not improving after OR today
   - treating empirically for c. diff with PO vancomycin and IV
   metronidazole.
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Had HD yesterday; ECG this am suggestive of hyperkalemia, sending stat
   K now.
   Will call renal as she may need emergent HD
   # RIJ Clot. Potential source being PICC line catheter, though not fully
   investigated there. There is RIJ clot however.
   -   Anticoagulation was started yesterday though she was oozing with
   increased blood loss
   - For now, deferring IV heparin given DIC like picture
   #. Diabetes: Continue RISS. Pt not aware of current re
   - follow fingersticks ; only obtaining sliding scale now, deferring
   tight control.
   - diabetic/renal diet
   #. ESRD on HD: HD on T, Th, Sat
   -   Will d/w renal re: HD today
   -   remains without access for cvvh.
   # Agitation: intubated and sedated wth fentanyl and versed.
   #. HTN: Hold BP meds for now
   #. COPD: ibtubated.
   #. Bradycardia: resolved; now tachycardic.
   #. CAD:
   - continue simvastatin, ASA
   - hold bblocker as hypotensive

","The patient's current condition is as follows:
- The patient is intubated and sedated with fentanyl and versed.
- They are on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450cc, rate of 14 bpm, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and CPAP mode.
- Blood pressure is low, and the patient is hypotensive despite vasopressor support.
- The patient has a history of sepsis and gram-negative bacteremia.
- There is evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with elevated PT/INR and low platelet count.
- The patient has renal insufficiency and is on dialysis.
- The patient has a right internal jugular vein thrombus.
- There is concern for abdominal pain, possibly due to intra-abdominal ischemia or Clostridium difficile infection.
- The patient's lactate levels are elevated, indicating poor tissue perfusion.
- There is a history of diabetes, COPD, CAD, hypertension, OSA, gastroparesis, and depression.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and cardiac medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. worsening sepsis and bacteremia
2. progression of DIC with potential bleeding complications
3. further decline in renal function
4. development of pulmonary complications due to mechanical ventilation
5. worsening of cardiovascular"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, previous ischemic colitis, and gangrene status post right below-knee amputation. She was admitted to the ICU for nonspecific pain and has been experiencing hypotension, increased lactate levels, and increased pressor requirements. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events include being in the operating room for a procedure, discontinuation of a PICC line and antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin), initiation of hemodialysis, and overnight hypotension requiring vasopressors.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 91/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. Her arterial blood gas results indicate a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 29 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 222, and lactate level of 7.0 mmol/L.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, ischemic colitis, and gangrene post right below-knee amputation. She presents with nonspecific pain and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently intubated to allow for studies.

The patient has undergone multiple surgeries, including a below-knee amputation and an unspecified procedure in the operating room. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected sepsis, as well as treatment for Clostridium difficile.

The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension with a blood pressure of 91/49 mmHg and an increased heart rate of 97 bpm. She also has an elevated lactate level of 7.0 mmol/L, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's blood cultures have shown growth of a gram-negative organism.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 21.6 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 29.4 mg/dL, and increased creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment.

The patient's imaging studies include a pending chest X-ray and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, which is being done to assess for ischemia and colitis."
