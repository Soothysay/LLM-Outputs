108289.0,233642,2172-10-23 07:15:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: GI bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   -EGD showed friability at site of anastamosis which was injected and
   blood in stomach.  Varices were noted in the lower third of the
   esophagus.
   - GI recommending repeat EGD with EUS when bleeding stops to evaluate
   for ulcers
   - could not get PICC due to long line for PICC
   - octreotide drip stopped because there was no evidence of bleeding
   varices
   - GI recommended checking a gastrin level
   - Hct 31.1 --> 28.8 --> 1 unit PRBCs --> 30.5 --> 29.0 --> 1 unit PRBCs
   - Hypernatremia improved with D5W 151 --> 147
   - Echo performed: Normal global biventricular systolic function.
   Limited study
   - iron studies show iron deficiency anemia so started on iron
   supplements
   *will need PICC placement or Left IJ today *

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site now with
   significant abdominal pain concerning for SBO.
   UGIB.  Patient with ongoing slow bleed, requiring daily transusions.
   Unable to place peripheral IVs.  Has RIJ placed at OSH which will need
   to be pulled and replaced with IR guided PICC.  With melena and BRBPR
   in a cirrhotic patient.  Also with extensive history of PUD and
   multiple abdominal surgeries.  Initial EGD reportedly without varices
   or clear causes of bleeding.  Also awaiting CT abdomen and bleeding
   scan report (being faxed from [**Hospital1 632**]; CD/images not sent with him.
   - Liver consult and likely EGD (overnight if unstable, otherwise in
   AM).
   - If no source from EGD, will need further bleeding workup (repeat
   tagged RBC scan, colonoscopy, surgery consult).
   - Consider NGT and NGL (patient currently quite resistant to NGT
   placement while awake).
   - PPI gtt.
   - Octreotide gtt until varices ruled out.
   - No ascites per exam and CT findings, no SBP prophylaxis needed.
   - Type and screen, crossmatch 4 units.  Will transfuse for hematocrit <
   30.
   - Q4H hct and platelets.
   - Goal platelets > 50K, INR < 1.5.
   - Bolus IVFs/blood for hypotension/tachycardia; hold antihypertensives.
   .
   # Abdominal pain.  Patient also with GIB as above, though pain has been
   unchanged from baseline chronic abdominal pain thought related to
   chronic pancreatitis.  Extensive abdominal surgeries in history.
   Patient reports being told that surgeries would not be recommended
   given his history, but if there was a problem that could only be
   managed surgically, he would pursue this is he were a candidate.  CT
   abdomen at OSH on [**10-18**] with some concern for air within stomach
   wall/contained perforation vs. trapped within folds.  Had subsequent
   EGD that was unremarkable.  Abdomen currently tender but soft, no
   rigidity or rebound, per patient at baseline chronic pain.
   - obtain CT images vs. repeat here; holding off currently in
   anticipation of EGD here early AM.
   - may need eventual surgical consult.  Not currently with surgical
   abdomen.
   .
   # Afib.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Check echocardiogram.
   - Can continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for time being.  Check
   digoxin level.
   - Would prefer to bolus IVFs or given blood initially to manage
   tachycardia, as will ongoing bleeding and likely intravascularly dry.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Presumed EtOH related.  Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver consult.
   - Collateral information.
   .
   # EtOH abuse. Sober x 10 years plus.
   - Multivitamin.
   .
   # Anemia.  Predominantly acute blood loss anemia.
   - Check B12, folate, Fe studies, TSH.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Currently 125.  200 at OSH admission, down to 60
   with requirement of platelet transfusions.  Consumption with active
   bleed vs. iver disease vs. hypersplenism (but CT report notes
history
   of splenectomy
 in clinical history), also consider bone marrow
   suppression, med related.  No heparin exposures.  On PPI, no H2
   blockers.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets <50, higher threshold if briskly bleeding.
   .
   # Renal insufficiency.  Creatinine now improved, was up to ~1.9 at
   OSH.  Contrast on [**10-18**].  Per past labs, 0.9 appears to be at baseline.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Na up to 157 at OSH today, improved to 151 here after
   getting some D5W at 70/h.
   - Continue D5W for ~2 L further (free water deficit likely greater than
   this).
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  No evidence of infection.  [**Month (only) 11**] be stress response.
   - Blood and urine cultures.
   - CXR without infiltrate.
   - Elect to hold further antibiotic therapy (received ~5 days of Zosyn
   at OSH).
   .
   # Chronic pain.  continue home regimen of methadone; morphine prn.
   .
   # Weight loss.  Patient cachectic; reports weight loss of 10 pounds in
   last week, though nothing before that; unclear baseline weight.
   - checking thyroid.
   - consent for HIV.
   - EGD with biopsy, other malignancy workup likely following acute
   bleed.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, liver cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and multiple abdominal surgeries. He presented with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from the anastomosis site and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's medical history includes chronic pancreatitis and extensive abdominal surgeries. He reports being told that surgeries would not be recommended due to his history, but if there was a problem that could only be managed surgically, he would pursue it if he were a candidate.

The patient has several complications and conditions, including atrial fibrillation (Afib), which is currently rate-controlled, presumed EtOH-related cirrhosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, hypernatremia, leukocytosis, chronic pain, and weight loss.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/65 mmHg to 137/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination findings include general appearance of being thin, eyes/conjunctiva being PERRL, normocephalic head/ears/nose/throat, normal cardiovascular sounds with no murmurs, symmetric breath sounds, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present and mild left-sided tenderness, positive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed from the anastomosis site, which is ongoing and requires daily transfusions. The source of the bleed is suspected to be the anastomosis site, which was found to be friable during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient also has esophageal varices but no active bleeding from them. He has a history of chronic abdominal pain due to pancreatitis and now presents with acutely worsening abdominal pain, raising concern for small bowel obstruction (SBO). There is uncertainty regarding air within the stomach wall/contained perforation versus trapped within folds, as seen on a previous computed tomography (CT) scan. The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation, currently rate-controlled. He has well-compensated cirrhosis, presumed alcoholic-related, with an unclear prior workup. The patient has been sober for the past 10 years. He is anemic with iron deficiency anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to active bleeding, liver disease, or hypersplenism. His renal function has improved, but there was a previous episode of renal insufficiency. He has hypernatremia, which resolved with D5W. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of GI bleed. The patient underwent an EGD which showed friability at the site of anastomosis, injection of blood in the stomach, and varices in the lower third of the esophagus. The patient's Hct levels were decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss. Octreotide drip was stopped due to no evidence of bleeding varices. The patient's hypernatremia improved with D5W. An echo was performed, revealing normal global biventricular systolic function but limited study. Iron studies showed iron deficiency anemia, so iron supplements were started. The patient's allergies include aspirin, with unknown last dose. The patient is currently on various medications including pantoprazole, fentanyl, midazolam, morphine sulfate, ferrous sulfate, MVI, digoxin, and methadone.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient's ongoing blood loss indicated by decreasing Hct levels suggests a high risk of re-bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure readings may indicate hypotension, which could be due to blood loss"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed.
   # UGIB.  With melena and BRBPR in a cirrhotic patient.  Also with
   extensive history of PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries.  Initial EGD
   reportedly without varices or clear causes of bleeding.  Also awaiting
   CT abdomen and bleeding scan report (being faxed from [**Hospital1 632**]; CD/images
   not sent with him.
   - Liver consult and likely EGD (overnight if unstable, otherwise in
   AM).
   - If no source from EGD, will need further bleeding workup (repeat
   tagged RBC scan, colonoscopy, surgery consult).
   - Consider NGT and NGL (patient currently quite resistant to NGT
   placement while awake).
   - PPI gtt.
   - Octreotide gtt until varices ruled out.
   - No ascites per exam and CT findings, no SBP prophylaxis needed.
   - Type and screen, crossmatch 4 units.  Will transfuse for hematocrit <
   30.
   - Q4H hct and platelets.
   - Goal platelets > 50K, INR < 1.5.
   - Bolus IVFs/blood for hypotension/tachycardia; hold antihypertensives.
   .
   # Abdominal pain.  Patient also with GIB as above, though pain has been
   unchanged from baseline chronic abdominal pain thought related to
   chronic pancreatitis.  Extensive abdominal surgeries in history.
   Patient reports being told that surgeries would not be recommended
   given his history, but if there was a problem that could only be
   managed surgically, he would pursue this is he were a candidate.  CT
   abdomen at OSH on [**10-18**] with some concern for air within stomach
   wall/contained perforation vs. trapped within folds.  Had subsequent
   EGD that was unremarkable.  Abdomen currently tender but soft, no
   rigidity or rebound, per patient at baseline chronic pain.
   - obtain CT images vs. repeat here; holding off currently in
   anticipation of EGD here early AM.
   - may need eventual surgical consult.  Not currently with surgical
   abdomen.
   .
   # Afib.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Check echocardiogram.
   - Can continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for time being.  Check
   digoxin level.
   - Would prefer to bolus IVFs or given blood initially to manage
   tachycardia, as will ongoing bleeding and likely intravascularly dry.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Presumed EtOH related.  Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver consult.
   - Collateral information.
   .
   # EtOH abuse. Sober x 10 years plus.
   - Multivitamin.
   .
   # Anemia.  Predominantly acute blood loss anemia.
   - Check B12, folate, Fe studies, TSH.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and multiple abdominal surgeries. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and presented with melena and blood-tinged nasogastric lavage (BRBPR). The initial endoscopic examination did not reveal varices or a clear source of bleeding. The patient also has chronic pancreatitis and a history of being told that surgeries would not be recommended due to his medical history, but if there was a problem that could only be managed surgically, he would pursue it if he were a candidate.

The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation (Afib), which is currently rate-controlled. He has presumed ethanol-related cirrhosis and evidence of chronic pain. His anemia is predominantly acute blood loss anemia, and he has thrombocytopenia, which is likely due to active bleeding, liver disease, or hypersplenism. He has a history of splenectomy. The patient's renal insufficiency has improved since admission, and he had hypernatremia, which has been corrected with D5W.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient is still at risk for re-bleeding, especially if the source of the bleeding is not identified and treated.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrh"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site now with
   significant abdominal pain concerning for SBO.
   UGIB.  Patient with ongoing slow bleed, requiring daily transusions.
   EGD yesterday showed source to be ?anastamosis site which was friable.
   Also had one cord of grade 1 esophageal varices.   Remains on PPI drip.
    Unable to place peripheral IVs.  Has RIJ placed at OSH which will need
   to be pulled and replaced with IR guided PICC.
   - continue PPI drip
   - consider surgical consult if patient has ongoing bleeding requiring
   daily transfusions as likely too slow for tagged RBC scan or IR
   - TID Hcts
   - PICC line placement today as unable to get peripherals
   - liver following
   - Bolus IVFs/blood for hypotension/tachycardia; hold antihypertensives.
   .
   # Abdominal pain.  Patient also with GIB as above, though pain has been
   unchanged from baseline chronic abdominal pain thought related to
   chronic pancreatitis.  Extensive abdominal surgeries in history.
   Patient reports being told that surgeries would not be recommended
   given his history, but if there was a problem that could only be
   managed surgically, he would pursue this is he were a candidate.  CT
   abdomen at OSH on [**10-18**] with some concern for air within stomach
   wall/contained perforation vs. trapped within folds.  Had subsequent
   EGD that was unremarkable.  Abdomen currently tender but soft, no
   rigidity or rebound, per patient at baseline chronic pain.
   - obtain CT images vs. repeat here; holding off currently in
   anticipation of EGD here early AM.
   - may need eventual surgical consult.  Not currently with surgical
   abdomen.
   .
   # Afib.  Currently rate controlled.
   - Check echocardiogram.
   - Can continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for time being.  Check
   digoxin level.
   - Would prefer to bolus IVFs or given blood initially to manage
   tachycardia, as will ongoing bleeding and likely intravascularly dry.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Presumed EtOH related.  Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver consult.
   - Collateral information.
   .
   # EtOH abuse. Sober x 10 years plus.
   - Multivitamin.
   .
   # Anemia.  Predominantly acute blood loss anemia.
   - Check B12, folate, Fe studies, TSH.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Currently 125.  200 at OSH admission, down to 60
   with requirement of platelet transfusions.  Consumption with active
   bleed vs. iver disease vs. hypersplenism (but CT report notes
history
   of splenectomy
 in clinical history), also consider bone marrow
   suppression, med related.  No heparin exposures.  On PPI, no H2
   blockers.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets <50, higher threshold if briskly bleeding.
   .
   # Renal insufficiency.  Creatinine now improved, was up to ~1.9 at
   OSH.  Contrast on [**10-18**].  Per past labs, 0.9 appears to be at baseline.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Na up to 157 at OSH today, improved to 151 here after
   getting some D5W at 70/h.
   - Continue D5W for ~2 L further (free water deficit likely greater than
   this).

   # Leukocytosis.  No evidence of infection.  [**Month (only) 11**] be stress response.
   - Blood and urine cultures.
   - CXR without infiltrate.
   - Elect to hold further antibiotic therapy (received ~5 days of Zosyn
   at OSH).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and Afib. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from anastomosis site and significant abdominal pain concerning for small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed that the source of bleeding is likely at the anastomosis site, which was friable, and there was also one cord of grade 1 esophageal varices. The patient remains on pantoprazole drip and is unable to place peripheral IVs. A right internal jugular (RIJ) line has been placed at OSH and will need to be pulled and replaced with an image-guided peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

The patient has ongoing slow bleeding requiring daily transfusions. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for abdominal pain. He reports being told that surgeries would not be recommended given his history, but if there was a problem that could only be managed surgically, he would pursue it if he were a candidate. A CT abdomen at OSH showed some concern for air within the stomach wall/contained perforation versus trapped within folds. An EGD was unremarkable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) caused by potential etiologies of PUD and varices. The endoscopy revealed small oozing at the Billroth anastomosis site and grade I varices. There are concerns for evolving pancreatitis, ileus vs SBO, and ongoing bleeding. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has a decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and platelet count. His renal function has improved, and there are no signs of infection or hypoxia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient continues to bleed slowly, and his Hct is drifting down. This could lead to further anemia and hypotension.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has an increased lipase level, which may indicate acute pancreatitis. This could worsen his overall condition and cause systemic complications.
3. Intestinal obstruction (ileus or SBO): The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness raise concerns for an intestinal obstruction. This can lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. It is unclear if this is due to consumption during active bleeding"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which is suspected to be caused by either peptic ulcer disease or esophageal varices. The patient underwent an endoscopy, which revealed small oozing at the Billroth anastomosis site and grade I esophageal varices. There are no plans for further intervention at this time.

The patient continues to bleed slowly, leading to a decrease in hematocrit levels. He also experiences marked tenderness in the left upper quadrant and mid-epigastric region. The medical team is concerned about the possibility of ileus or small bowel obstruction, as well as evolving pancreatitis. They plan to further evaluate the abdominal pain and may request a plain film to assess for these conditions.

The patient's platelet count is currently 125, down from 200 at the time of admission. The medical team is considering various causes for thrombocytopenia, including platelet consumption due to active bleeding, liver disease, hypersplenism (although the patient had a splenectomy in the past), and bone marrow suppression possibly related to medication. They plan to continue monitoring the platelet count and may consider platelet transfusion if the level drops below 50.

   will plan to perform a UGI today. We will work to obtain the OSH
   records (actual CT scan would be helpful).
   - Liver consult and EGD today
   - Depending on course and imaging he may require surgical consultt
   - Hct> 30, Plt >50, INR <1.5 q 8hrs Hct checks until stable.   Type and
   screen, crossmatch 4 units
   - PPI gtt.
   - Octreotide gtt until varices ruled out.
   - Goal platelets > 50K, INR < 1.5.
   - Bolus IVFs/blood for hypotension/tachycardia; hold antihypertensives.
   - check lactate and lipase/amylase
   .
   # Afib / ST seg depression.; likely appropriate tachycardia given his
   drop in Hct, although Af-ib will no doubt complicate our ability to
   maintain BP Currently rate controlled. The ST seg drepession were not
   present on [**2172-10-18**], this may be from his Afib wth RVR , although now he
   is rate controlled at present, compuded by low Hct. Will need to cycle
   enzymes and check a TTE
   - Can continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for time being.  Check
   digoxin level, although this does not appear to be digoxin toxicity.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation (Afib). He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which could be due to PUD or esophageal varices. The patient underwent an endoscopy to identify the source of bleeding, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) was performed to assess for any cardiac abnormalities.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 114/65 mmHg and a heart rate of 88 beats per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) via infusion, as well as fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation.

The patient's lab results show a low hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, indicating anemia likely due to the GI bleed. His platelet count is 125 K/uL, which is below normal but not critically low. The rest of the lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. UGIB: The patient is being evaluated for variceal bleeding versus PUD. A upper GI endoscopy will be performed today to determine the source of bleeding.
2. Liver consult and esophagogastroduodenos"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, potentially due to PUD or varices. The endoscopy revealed small varices (Grade I) and some oozing at the Billroth anastomosis site.

   dehiscence with contrast and air leak suggested by CT. His HCT is
   stable x 24 hrs and hemodynamically he is stable.

   Total time spent: 30 min
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis presumed due to alcohol abuse, previous upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) surgery, atrial fibrillation, and other medical conditions. He was admitted with melena and bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), and the source of the bleeding is still unclear. The patient has received blood transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet transfusions. His hemodynamic stability has improved, but he continues to experience abdominal pain. He is currently on prophylactic medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's anemia workup shows iron deficiency anemia, and his thrombocytopenia is improving. He has asymmetric edema in his left upper extremity and a history of splenectomy. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis and previous UGIB surgery puts him at a higher risk for recurrent bleeding. The source of the current bleed is still uncertain, and there is concern for possible dehiscence of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis site.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is worsening, but the etiology is unclear. It could be related to acute on chronic pancreatitis or anastomotic perfusion issues.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia workup indicates iron deficiency anemia, which may require iron supplementation.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been low, possibly due to consumption during active bleeding, underlying liver disease, hypersplenism (although he has a history of splenectomy), or medication-related bone marrow suppression. Platelet transfusions have been given, and the count is improving.
5. Asymmetric Edema: The patient has asymmetric edema in his left upper extremity, which could be a sign of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further evaluation is needed to confirm this.
6. Liver Disease: The patient has well-compensated cirrhosis presumed to be related to alcohol abuse. A liver consult may be necessary for further evaluation and management.
7. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics and antifungal medications for possible anastomotic microperforation. Monitoring for signs of infection is essential.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage the potential complications mentioned above."

   Billroth [**Hospital 2098**] transfer from [**Hospital3 1492**] with melena and BRBPR.
   Patient was admitted on [**2172-10-16**] with melena and BRBPR x 2 days.  Also
   associated with crampy abdominal pain and nausea.  Initial hematocrit
   26.5, INR 1.8, developed thrombocytopenia to 60s as well.  Had EGD in
   ED which showed no varices, obvious ulcers or tears.  Source thought to
   be ""dusky"" patch in stomach. Stomach filled with blood and unable to
   visualize duodenum.  Per HO report 6 units PRBCs given in addition to 2
   units FFP (though nursing reports 10 units PRBCs, FFP and platelets).
   Per notes, repeat EGD performed [**10-20**].  Bright red blood in gastric
   reminant without ulceration seen.  Also appears to have had bleeding
   scan performed with results unavailable currently. Continued to have
   evidence of bleeding during hospital course; HO reported cessation of
   bleeding and then restart, though not clear from notes.  Patient has
   complained of epigastric area abdominal pain, but nothing out of
   ordinary from usual chronic abdominal pain.  Denies hematemesis.  No
   chest pain or shortness of breath.  + occasional palps.  Denies
   abdominal swelling/ascites.  Patient also with Afib with RVR (to 160)
   on presentation requiring diltiazem gtt with eventual transition to
   dilt PO and digoxin PO.  [**Hospital1 632**] notes some hypotension (as low as 84/50

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis presumed due to EtOH, past Billroth II surgery for PUD, and multiple abdominal surgeries.
- The patient was admitted with melena and BRBPR (blood and/or black, tarry stools), along with crampy abdominal pain and nausea.
- Initial hematocrit was 26.5, INR was 1.8, and thrombocytopenia developed (platelet count of 60s).
- An EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) showed no varices, obvious ulcers, or tears, but a ""dusky"" patch in the stomach, with the stomach filled with blood and unable to visualize the duodenum.
- The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets.
- A repeat EGD performed later showed bright red blood in the gastric remnant without ulceration seen.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site now with
   significant abdominal pain. The source of GI bleed is not clear but
   prime suspect is the anastomotic site with concern of possible
   dehiscence with contrast and air leak suggested by CT. His HCT is
   stable x 24 hrs and hemodynamically he is stable.
   GIB: likely from site of gastro-jejunal anastomosis
   -Continue PPI,
   -plans for repeat EGD in near future
 await GI to see thia afternoon
   and indicate timing.
   -Surgery following closely
   -Monitor HCT Q8 today
   Abd pain: Waxes and wanes in severity,  ? anastomotic micro perf
   -On Abx/antifungal for possible anastamotic microperf
   -Conservative management per surgery (appreciate input)
   -Will start TPN for anticipated long-NPO (may need to bridge with PPN
   while working on IV access)
   Afib.   Remains in A. fib, but currently rate controlled.
   - echocardiogram WNL
 Continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for
   now
   .
   Cirrhosis.  Well compensated cirrhosis, presumed alcoholic related.
   Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver consult following. EtOH abuse. Sober x 10 years plus.-
   Multivitamin.
   .
   Anemia.  Anemia work up shows iron deficiency anemia.
   - iron supplementation
   Thrombocytopenia.  200 at OSH admission, down to 60 with requirement of
   platelet transfusions.  Consumption with active bleed vs. iver disease
   vs. hypersplenism (but CT report notes
history of splenectomy
   clinical history), also consider bone marrow suppression, med related.
   No heparin exposures.  On PPI, no H2 blockers. PLT count improving.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets <50, higher threshold if briskly bleeding.
   LUE asymmetric edema
   -Check for DVT
   ..
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO now with likely need for TPN is prolonged NPO while perf
   is healing (per surgery)
   Glycemic Control:
   Lines: right IJ from OSH. Unable to change yesterday (wire not passing
   on left). Will re-attempt today. Will need either CVL or PICC with a
   port saved for TPN

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, presumed due to alcohol abuse, and previous upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU with melena and lower bowel pain, which was initially thought to be due to anastomotic site bleeding. However, the source of the bleeding is still unclear. The patient underwent an abdominal CT scan that showed microperfusion of the GI anastomosis but no acute surgical complications. He was given broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment, as well as serial exams. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, depression, psychosis, deep vein thrombosis, and implantation of an inferior vena cava filter. He also has chronic pancreatitis with a history of pseudocyst resection, hypertension, and liver disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is hemodynamically stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient initially presented with melena and lower bowel pain, suggesting ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The source of the bleeding is still unclear, and there is concern for possible dehiscence at the anastomotic site with air leak suggested by the CT scan.
2. Infection: The patient received broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment due to the suspicion of anastomotic microperfusion and possible infection.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has well-compensated cirrh"

   Patient was admitted on [**2172-10-16**] with melena and BRBPR x 2 days.  Also
   associated with crampy abdominal pain and nausea.  Initial hematocrit
   26.5, INR 1.8, developed thrombocytopenia to 60s as well.  Had EGD in
   ED which showed no varices, obvious ulcers or tears.  Source thought to
   be ""dusky"" patch in stomach. Stomach filled with blood and unable to
   visualize duodenum.  Per HO report 6 units PRBCs given in addition to 2
   units FFP (though nursing reports 10 units PRBCs, FFP and platelets).
   Per notes, repeat EGD performed [**10-20**].  Bright red blood in gastric
   reminant without ulceration seen.  Also appears to have had bleeding
   scan performed with results unavailable currently. Continued to have
   evidence of bleeding during hospital course; HO reported cessation of
   bleeding and then restart, though not clear from notes.  Patient has
   complained of epigastric area abdominal pain, but nothing out of
   ordinary from usual chronic abdominal pain.  Denies hematemesis.  No
   chest pain or shortness of breath.  + occasional palps.  Denies
   abdominal swelling/ascites.  Patient also with Afib with RVR (to 160)
   on presentation requiring diltiazem gtt with eventual transition to
   dilt PO and digoxin PO.  [**Hospital1 632**] notes some hypotension (as low as 84/50
   seen in notes) but not requiring pressors at any time.

   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed  with PUD and varices [**1-11**] EtOH as
   potential etiologies.
   >UGIB.  Concerning for variceal bleed vs PUD given his above hx. GI
   will plan to perform a UGI today. We will work to obtain the OSH
   records (actual CT scan would be helpful).  The EGD revealed some small
   amount of oozing at the Billroth anas site and some varices (Grade I).
   There is no plan for further intervention at this point unless he
   decompensates (actively bleeds at which point we can consider
   re-imaging vs tagged rbc. He conts to bleed slowly with drift down in
   the Hct.  He has a marked increase in LUQ tenderness and mid epigastric
   tenderness. Will check plain film to further evaluate, we would be
   concerned for illeus vs SBO.  Would also be concerned for evolving
   pancreatitis.
   - Will further evaluate the abdominal pain as above.
   - F/u gastrin level
   - Hct> 30, Plt >50, INR <1.5 q 8hrs Hct checks until stable.   Type and
   screen, crossmatch 4 units
   - PPI gtt.
   - Goal platelets > 50K, INR < 1.5.
   - Bolus IVFs/blood for hypotension/tachycardia; hold antihypertensives.
   - check lactate and lipase/amylase
   .
   > Afib / ST seg depression.; likely appropriate tachycardia given his
   drop in Hct, although Afib will no doubt complicate our ability to
   maintain BP Currently rate controlled. The ST seg drepession were not
   present on [**2172-10-18**], this may be from his Afib wth RVR , although now he
   is rate controlled at present, compuded by low Hct. The ECG has not
   changed [**10-23**] and his TTE is grossly normal and his enzymes have
   trended down.
   - Can continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for time being.
   >Cirrhosis.  Presumed EtOH related.
   - F/u liver reccomendations.
   > EtOH abuse. Sober x 10 years plus, no evidence of withdrawl
   - Multivitamin.
   >Thrombocytopenia.  Currently 125.  200 at OSH admission, down to 60
   with requirement of platelet transfusions.  Consumption with active
   bleed vs. iver disease vs. hypersplenism (but CT report notes
history
   of splenectomy
 in clinical history and pt thinks he has ), also
   consider bone marrow suppression, med related.  No heparin exposures.
   On PPI, no H2 blockers.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets <50, higher threshold if briskly bleeding.
   .
   > Renal insufficiency.  Creatinine now improved, was up to ~1.9 at
   OSH.  Contrast on [**10-18**].  Per past labs, 0.9 appears to be at baseline.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .> Hypernatremia: has improved with IV hydration.
   > Chronic pain.  continue home regimen of methadone; morphine prn.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding from an anastomosis site and significant abdominal pain, which is concerning for small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has ongoing slow bleeding requiring daily transfusions. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) yesterday showed the source to be friable anastomosis site and one cord of grade 1 esophageal varices. He remains on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) - The patient has ongoing slow bleeding, which is concerning as it may require surgical intervention if not controlled.
2. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) - The patient has chronic abdominal pain secondary to pancreatitis and now presents with acutely worsening abdominal pain. Given his history of multiple bowel surgeries, there is a concern for SBO. Further diagnostic tests are needed to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Thrombocytopenia - The patient's platelet count has decreased from 125 to 60, indicating thrombocytopenia. This could be due to consumption during active bleeding, underlying liver disease, hypersplenism (although the patient had a splenectomy), or bone marrow suppression related to medications. Platelet transfusions may be required if the plate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, previous upper gastrointestinal surgery, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed from an anastomosis site, which is now being treated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip. The patient also has significant abdominal pain concerning for small bowel obstruction (SBO) and has undergone several tests, including an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient requires daily transfusions to manage the ongoing slow bleed. Surgical consultation may be necessary if the bleeding continues.
2. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a history of multiple bowel surgeries, and his symptoms suggest the possibility of SBO. Further imaging, such as a CT scan, may be required to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, management options include bowel rest, nasogastric tube decompression, and potential surgical intervention.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is concern for platelet consumption due to the active bleed. Transfusion of platelets may be necessary, and the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia needs to be evaluated further.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated but have improved since the use of contrast. Monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding from an anastomotic site and is now experiencing significant abdominal pain. The source of the GI bleed is unclear, but the anastomotic site is suspected with concerns of possible dehiscence and air leak suggested by a CT scan. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels have been stable over the past 24 hours, and he is hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemia and shock if not managed promptly.
2. Anastomotic dehiscence: There is a concern about the possibility of anastomotic dehiscence, which refers to the breakdown of the surgical connection between two parts of the intestine. This can result in further bleeding and infection.
3. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's worsening abdominal pain may indicate acute pancreatitis, which can be a serious complication if left untreated.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has significantly decreased, indicating thrombocytopenia. This condition increases the risk of bleeding, especially in the context of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient had an episode of hyper"

   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site now with
   significant abdominal pain. The source of GI bleed is not clear but
   prime suspect is the anastomotic site with concern of possible
   dehiscence with contrast and air leak suggested by CT. His HCT is
   stable x 24 hrs and hemodynamically he is stable.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) from an anastomosis site, now presenting with significant abdominal pain. The source of the GI bleed is unclear, but the anastomotic site is a prime suspect due to possible dehiscence with contrast and air leak suggested by CT. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is stable over the past 24 hours, and he is hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further blood loss and potential shock if not managed appropriately.

2. Anastomotic dehiscence: The patient's abdominal pain and evidence of air leak on CT suggest a possible anastomotic dehiscence, which is a surgical emergency.

3. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics and antifungal medications, indicating a concern for infection related to the anastomosis site or other sources.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: As a result of the patient's cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as altered mental status or confusion.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia and anemia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and multiple abdominal surgeries. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding from anastomosis site and ongoing abdominal pain. The patient has been diagnosed with cirrhosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, and hypernatremia. He is currently receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip for stress ulcer prophylaxis and will undergo a percutaneous central venous line (CVL) or peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) placement. The patient's condition remains stable, and he is being managed conservatively due to his extensive abdominal surgeries.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's current condition involves upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock if not promptly managed.
2. Microperforation: There is a concern for microperforation in the abdomen, possibly related to scope trauma from the recent endoscopic examination. Conservative management is being pursued at this time.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 60. Platelet transfusions may be required for active bleeding or if the platelet count drops further.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated but have improved. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and the use"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site now with
   significant abdominal pain. The source of GI bleed is not clear but
   prime suspect is the anastomotic site with concern of possible
   dehiscence with contrast and air leak suggested by CT. His HCT is
   stable x 24 hrs and hemodynamically he is stable.
   GIB:
   -Continue PPI,
   -plans for repeat EGD in near future
   -follow-up with GI and surgery
   -Monitor HCT Q8 today
   Abd pain: worsening exam; etiology unclear: ? acute on chronic
   pancreatitis, ? anastomotic perf
   -On Abx/antifungal for possible anastamotic dehiscence
   -Conservative management per surgery (appreciate input)
   -Will start TPN for anticipated long-NPO
   Afib.   Remains in A. fib, but currently rate controlled.
   - echocardiogram WNL.
   - Can continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for now
   .
   Cirrhosis.  Well compensated cirrhosis, presumed alcoholic related.
   Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver consult followin.
   .
   EtOH abuse. Sober x 10 years plus.
   - Multivitamin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) from an anastomotic site, and his current condition is stable. The source of the GI bleed is unclear, but the anastomotic site is a prime suspect. The patient has significant abdominal pain, which could be due to acute on chronic pancreatitis or anastomotic perfusion issues. He is on antibiotics and antifungal medication for possible anastomotic dehiscence. Conservative management is being planned, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) will be started due to anticipated long-term nothing by mouth (NPO) status.

The patient has a history of compensated cirrhosis, presumed to be alcoholic-related. Anemia workup shows iron deficiency anemia, and the patient is receiving iron supplementation. Thrombocytopenia is present, with a platelet count of 60, and the patient has required platelet transfusions. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, with possibilities including platelet consumption with active bleeding, liver disease, hypersplenism (although the patient had a splenectomy), or medication-related bone marrow suppression.

Hypernatremia has resolved with D5W administration. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is hemodynam"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-inch individual admitted to the ICU with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple attempts to place a peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) line failing. An attempt to place a left internal jugular (LIJ) line was also unsuccessful. A right ovarian vein (ROV) line was placed instead. 

The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) abdomen with oral contrast, which revealed free air in the mesentery. As a result, the patient was consulted with surgery. They were started on intravenous fluconazole and zosyn for possible extravasation of oral contrast into the abdomen. Serum protein electrophoresis/urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP/UPEP) was sent off for low anion gap. An overnight chest X-ray (OSH CT scan) was taken and logged into the computer.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level was found to be 11.0 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) at 30.5%, and platelet count (Plt) at 110,000/mm3. The white blood cell (WBC) count was within normal range. Blood cultures were obtained at different times. Electrolyte levels were mostly within normal limits, except for slightly elevated potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++). Liver function tests (LFTs) and renal function tests (RFTs) were within normal range. Troponin-T levels were negative, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. 

The patient is currently on continuous infusion of pantoprazole (Protonix) at a rate of 8 mg/hour. They also receive other ICU medications, including morphine sulfate, which was started at 01:45 AM on October 24th. 

The patient's vital signs remained relatively stable throughout the day, with a temperature range of 36.9-36.6°C (98.5-97.8°F), heart rate (HR) between 76-95 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 137/87-112/63 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) between 20-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 97%. The patient's rhythm was noted to be atrial fibrillation (AF). 

The patient's fluid balance showed a total intake of 4,923 mL, with 1,099 mL administered through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Output included 3,000 mL of urine and 2,070 mL of nasogastric (NG) drainage. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula, with an ABG showing pH of 7.30. 

Physical examination revealed a well-nourished individual in no acute distress. The patient had soft and bowel"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site also with
   microperforation of bowel.
   1.  UGIB.  Bleeding source may be friability at anastamosis site from
   prior bilroth surgery.  Hct stable.  Now on [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV.  No
   transfusiosn in > 48 hours.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - surgery following
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - Access
 retry CVL vs. waiting for Monday for PICC vs. retry
   peripherals.
   - liver following
   - Bolus IVFs/blood for hypotension/tachycardia; hold antihypertensives.
   .
   2.  Air in mesentery.  Concern for microperforations, per surgery,
   perhaps related to scope trauma from OSH EGD.  NPO for three days now.
   Abominal exam improving, but will continue NPO for now. If he remains
   NPO for several more days, will need TPN.  Managing conservatively
   given extensive abdominal surgeries in past, would be difficult
   procedure.
   -          appreciate surgery recs.
   -          Serial abdominal exams
   -          Repeat CT vs. KUB for change in exam.
   -          NPO for today.
   .
   3.       B/l upper extremity clots.  Patient has significant clot
   burden, making line placement difficult.  Unable to anticoagulate at
   present due to GIB.  Cachexia, weight loss, and extensive clot burden
   concerning for malignancy.
   -no anticoagulation in setting of GI bleed
   - outpatient age appropriate cancer screening
   3. Abdominal pain.  Patient has chronic abdominal pain secondary to
   pancreatitis, but with concern for microperforation as above.
   - surgery following.
   - NPO for today
   - minimize opioids
   .
   4.   Afib.   Remains in A. fib, but currently rate controlled.  TTE
   performed this admission.  Not anticoagulated due to GIB.
   - continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for now
   .
   5.  Cirrhosis.  Well compensated cirrhosis, presumed alcoholic
   related.  Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver following
   - Collateral information if any, ?need to repeat any workup re:
   etiology
   .
   6.  Anemia.  Anemia work up shows iron deficiency anemia.
   - iron supplementation
   7.  Thrombocytopenia.  200 at OSH admission, down to 60 with
   requirement of platelet transfusions.  Consumption with active bleed
   vs. liver disease vs. also consider bone marrow suppression, med
   related.  No heparin exposures.  On PPI, no H2 blockers.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets <50, higher threshold if briskly bleeding.
   8.   Renal insufficiency.  Creatinine now improved, was up to ~1.9 at
   OSH.  Contrast on [**10-18**].  Per past labs, 0.9 appears to be at baseline.
   - Continue to monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and required an endoscopic examination (EGD). The patient has been receiving fluconazole and zosyn antibiotics. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been stable, improving from 32.1% to 32.6%. Sodium levels have also improved from 146 to 142. The patient's proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was changed from a continuous infusion to a bolus IV dose twice daily. Two peripheral IV lines were placed in the right arm. An ultrasound revealed extensive clot burden, including a right superficial clot and bilateral brachial clots. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, known as the OSH Right RIF, is still in place.

The patient has allergies to aspirin and an unknown antibiotic. The last doses of fluconazole and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) were administered on 10/24/2172 at 06:00 AM and 10/25/2172 at 12:10 AM, respectively. The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the GI bleed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/94 mmHg to 121/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,119 mL, with 664 mL given through the PO route. The total output includes 3,715 mL of blood products and 1,480 mL of urine. Negative fluid balances of -596 mL and -816 mL are noted for the NG and stool routes, respectively.

The patient requires respiratory support, with an ABG reading of ///30/. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished, thin individual with clear breath sounds. Peripheral pulses are not assessed due to the extensive clot burden. Neurologic assessment is also not performed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count at 12.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 11.0 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) at 32.2%, platelet count (Plt) at 153 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.0 mg/dL, troponin-T at 0.01 mg/dL, and blood glucose at 131 mg/dL. Other lab values include normal potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels, as well as slightly elevated BUN, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphorus (PO43-) levels.

   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site also with ongoing
   abdominal pain and concern of microperforation.
   # UGIB.  s/p EGD at admission here - source ?anastamosis site which was
   friable.  Also had one cord of grade 1 esophageal varices.   Remains on
   PPI drip.  Unable to place peripheral IVs.  Has RIJ placed at OSH which
   will need to be pulled and replaced with IR guided PICC.    No
   transfusions x 24 hours with stable Hct
   - continue PPI drip, will d/w liver re: change to bolus dosing.
   - surgery following
   - [**Hospital1 **]-TID Hcts
   - Access
 retry CVL vs. waiting for Monday for PICC vs. retry
   peripherals.
   - liver following
   - Bolus IVFs/blood for hypotension/tachycardia; hold antihypertensives.
   .
   # ?Air in mesentery.  Concern for microperforations, per surgery,
   perhaps related to scope trauma from OSH EGD.  Managing conservatively
   given extensive abdominal surgeries in past, would be difficult
   procedure.
   -          appreciate surgery recs.
   -          Serial abdominal exams
   -          Repeat CT vs. KUB for change in exam.
   -          NPO for today.
   .
   # Abdominal pain.  Patient has chronic abdominal pain secondary to
   pancreatitis, but with concern for microperforation as above.
   - surgery following.
   - NPO for today
   - minimize opioids
   .
   # Afib.   Remains in A. fib, but currently rate controlled.  TTE
   performed this admission.
   - continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for now
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Well compensated cirrhosis, presumed alcoholic related.
   Unclear prior workup.
   - Liver following
   - Collateral information if any, ?need to repeat any workup re:
   etiology
   .
   # Anemia.  Anemia work up shows iron deficiency anemia.
   - iron supplementation
   # Thrombocytopenia.  200 at OSH admission, down to 60 with requirement
   of platelet transfusions.  Consumption with active bleed vs. liver
   disease vs. also consider bone marrow suppression, med related.  No
   heparin exposures.  On PPI, no H2 blockers.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Transfuse platelets <50, higher threshold if briskly bleeding.
   .
   # Renal insufficiency.  Creatinine now improved, was up to ~1.9 at
   OSH.  Contrast on [**10-18**].  Per past labs, 0.9 appears to be at baseline.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.   Resolved with D5W, but back up some today.  Getting
   some D5W, some D51/2, rechecking this afternoon.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from an anastomosis site. He also has ongoing abdominal pain, concern for microperforation, pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency. The patient remains on PPI drip and is unable to place peripheral IVs, with a right internal jugular (RIJ) placed at the outside hospital which will need to be pulled and replaced with an inferior vena cava (IVC) line. The patient's Hct is stable, sodium levels have improved, and he is receiving various medications including fluconazole, zosyn, morphine, pantoprazole, and digoxin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient's current condition of UGIB poses a high risk for re-bleeding, further gastrointestinal complications, or even death if not managed properly.
2. Microperforation: The concern for microperforation increases the risk of peritonitis, sepsis, and other abdominal complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may lead to increased bleeding risk, especially considering the ongoing UGIB.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's history of renal insufficiency can worsen if there are any"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from an anastomosis site and significant abdominal pain. The source of the GI bleed is suspected to be the gastro-jejunal anastomosis site, with concern for possible dehiscence indicated by a CT scan showing contrast and air leak. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, and his hematocrit (HCT) has been stable for 48 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's upper GI bleed from the anastomosis site could lead to further bleeding, anemia, hypotension, and shock.
2. Anastomotic Dehiscence: The concern of possible anastomotic dehiscence increases the risk of complications such as peritonitis, sepsis, and further bleeding.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of bilateral DVT and has developed new DVTs in the right upper extremity and left brachial veins. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Hepatic Cirrhosis: The patient's well-compensated cirrhosis may progress to decompensated cirrhosis, leading to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation.
- The patient was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from an anastomosis site and is experiencing significant abdominal pain.
- The source of the GI bleed is suspected to be the gastro-jejunal anastomosis site, with possible anastomotic dehiscence suggested by CT findings.
- The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, and he is hemodynamically stable.
- The patient has a history of well-compensated cirrhosis, presumed to be alcoholic-related.
- He has been sober for 10 years.
- The patient has iron deficiency anemia and thrombocytopenia, which is improving with platelet transfusions.
- He also has asymmetric lower extremity edema, which may be related to deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- His glycemic control is being monitored.
- The patient has multiple lines in place for various medications and fluids.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) / do-not-intubate (DNI) code status.
- The patient is expected to stay in the ICU for further management and evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anastomotic dehiscence: The patient's significant abdominal pain and GI bleed suggest the possibility of anastomotic dehiscence. This condition occurs when the surgical connection between two parts of the intestine separates or ruptures. It can lead to severe bleeding and infection.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: As a patient with cirrhosis, the patient is at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy. This condition occurs due to the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream that are normally removed by the liver. Symptoms can include confusion, altered mental status, and loss of consciousness.

3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to cirrhosis and ongoing antibiotic use increases the risk of infection. Infections can be bacterial, fungal, or viral, and may affect different organs or systems in the body.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's asymmetric lower extremity edema raises suspicion for DVT. DVT is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, usually in the legs. If the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs, it can cause a potentially life-threatening condition called pulmonary embolism.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's initial presentation of GI bleed from the anastomosis site indicates the risk of further bleeding. The source"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, PUD, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from anastomosis site and significant abdominal pain. The source of GIB is suspected to be the gastro-jejunal anastomosis site, possibly due to dehiscence with contrast and air leak as suggested by a CT scan. The patient's hemodynamic and hematocrit (HCT) status have been stable for the past 48 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's current condition involves upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from the site of gastro-jejunal anastomosis. This can lead to hypotension, shock, and potential need for blood transfusions.

2. Anastomotic Dehiscence: The patient's abdominal pain and air leak suggested by CT raise concerns about anastomotic dehiscence, which is a potential complication following gastrointestinal surgery.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of bilateral DVT and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. There is also evidence of right subclavian and bilateral brachial clots. Anticoagulation is not currently possible due to recent GI bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and multiple abdominal surgeries, and
   Afib, admit with upper GI bleed from anastamosis site now with
   significant abdominal pain. The source of GI bleed is not clear but
   prime suspect is the anastomotic site with concern of possible
   dehiscence with contrast and air leak suggested by CT. His HCT is
   stable x 48 hrs and hemodynamically he is stable.
   GIB: likely from site of gastro-jejunal anastomosis
   -Continue PPI,
   -plans for repeat EGD in near future
   -Surgery following closely. No plans for suregery. Recommended TPN
   -Monitor HCT daily now
   Abd pain: Improved. Likely [**1-11**] anastomotic micro perf
   -On Abx/antifungal for anastamotic microperf
   -Conservative management per surgery (appreciate input)
   -Will start TPN for anticipated long-NPO (may need to bridge with PPN
   while working on IV access)
   Right subclavian and b/l brachial clots as well as h/o LE DVT s/p IVC
   filter several years ago. Unable to anticoagulate at this point given
   recent GI bleed and h/o multiple prior UGIB
   -Will discuss with GI and surgery about long-term magagement of the
   this complicated issue
   -He will also need cancer screening given his weight loss and diffuse
   clots
   Afib.   Remains in A. fib, but currently rate controlled.
   - echocardiogram WNL
 Continue digoxin; hold other nodal agents for
   now
   .
   Cirrhosis.  Well compensated cirrhosis, presumed alcoholic related.
   Unclear prior workup.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis, peptic ulcer disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and atrial fibrillation.
- He was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from anastomosis site, accompanied by significant abdominal pain.
- The source of the GI bleed is suspected to be the gastro-jejunal anastomosis site, possibly due to dehiscence indicated by contrast and air leak on CT scan.
- The patient's hemodynamic status and hematocrit (HCT) have been stable for the past 48 hours.
- The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right subclavian and bilateral brachial veins, as well as a history of lower extremity DVT with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed several years ago.
- Due to the recent GI bleed and history of multiple prior upper GI bleeds, the patient is unable to be anticoagulated at this time.
- The patient has also experienced weight loss and diffuse clots, which may require cancer screening.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled, and an echocardiogram shows normal results.
- The patient has well-compensated cirrhosis, presumed to be alcoholic-related, with an unclear prior workup.
- The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will require total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- The patient's glycemic control and lines are being monitored.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions.
- The patient has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI) and is being transferred to the floor."
