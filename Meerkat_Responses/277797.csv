   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, ruled out for PE.
   .
   #Acute episodes of dyspnea with EKG changes and elevated PA pressure
   -unclear etiology at this time possibly due to acute coronary artery
   occlusion that lysed prior to cath vs pulmonary embolus.  No evidence
   of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath.  Other possibility could
   be CHF although wedge only 15.  Atrial fibrillation possibly seen at
   OSH, however not documented, which could explain dyspnea, as well as
   other tachyarrhythmia, no evidence of this so far.  Primary pulmonary
   process possible including pneumonia.   Also must consider myocarditis
   or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may be consistent with this
   diagnosis.
   - CTA negative for PE
   - Lower extremitiy venous duplex negative for DVT
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - Serial ekg's
   - Transthoracic echocardiogram shows right atrial clot
   - Oxygen as needed
   - Monitor on telemetry

   # Elevated CK: At this time etiology of elevated CK is unknown. CKMB
   not elevated so is not cardiac in origin. Other possible etiologies
   include Seizure or cerebral infarct, Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis,
   Inflammatory myositis, Infection, medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH pending
   - Consider Neuro Consult
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with episodic dyspnea and dynamic EKG changes, which are now post-cardiac catheterization. Her coronaries are clean, but she has significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure and possible recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She has a clot in the right atrium and small pericardial effusion. Other possible causes for her symptoms include pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, myocarditis, or myopericarditis. She is currently on heparin and being monitored on telemetry. 

The patient also has elevated CK levels, leukocytosis, and a history of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Her urine culture and urinalysis are pending. Additionally, there is concern for acute renal failure, as her creatinine has increased to 1.7. She has a history of CVA with mild gait changes, and her head CT at another hospital was unremarkable. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 120/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has a JVP of 13cm and right lung field crackles. Her labs show a"

    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly

   #Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath, or
   PE/DVT onCT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   ----Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has PE -> cannot
   rule out Malignancy
   Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible including
   pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
    Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro)
   - Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of micro hemorrhage in
   brain
   - BNP today for further risk stratification

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of episodic dyspnea and dynamic EKG changes after undergoing cardiac catheterization. The patient's coronary arteries were found to have minimal disease.

The patient's current condition shows she is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a right atrial clot and evidence of sub-segmental clots in the lungs. Although the CT scan did not show a large main PA thrombus, it cannot rule out the possibility of PE completely. The patient's clinical findings suggest possible recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation. Further investigation, such as a V/Q scan or repeat CT scan, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Malignancy: The etiology of the patient's PE is unclear, and malignancy should be considered as a possible underlying cause. Additional tests, such as tumor markers or imaging studies, may be required to evaluate this possibility.

3. Myocarditis or Myopericarditis: The patient's EKG changes may be consistent with myocarditis or myopericarditis. Further evaluation, including cardiac enzymes and additional imaging, may be needed to rule out these conditions.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and prior stroke. She presents with episodic dyspnea and dynamic EKG changes after cardiac catheterization. Coronary arteries are minimal, but there is right ventricular dilation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with elevated pulmonary artery pressure. A probable mass in the right atrium was noted on echo. The patient has a right atrial clot, but no large main PA thrombus or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. Leukocytosis is present with a count of 20K. There is also evidence of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. The patient has an elevated creatinine level indicating acute renal failure, possibly due to Lasix administration at the rehab facility. Metabolic alkalosis is also present. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia and elevated JVP suggesting right heart failure. The patient's neurological status is stable with a non-focal neuro exam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraventricular hemorrhage: The CT scan shows a high density area in the left occipital region, likely representing a tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. This requires close monitoring and further assessment.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Despite negative CT and ultrasound findings, the presence of a right atrial clot raises suspicion for PE. The patient's clinical findings, including dyspnea and t"

   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   ----Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has PE -> cannot

   abnormal presentation for clot development.
   Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible including
   pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
    Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro)

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and a prior stroke. She was admitted to the ICU for episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries but significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure. There were also findings of a probable mass in the right atrium. She has been on systemic anticoagulation with heparin due to a right atrial clot.

The patient's symptoms include tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, and a weak/soft voice. Physical examination shows sclera anicteric, PERRL, supple neck with JVP of 13 cm, tachycardic with normal S1, S2, no murmurs or gallops, no chest wall deformities or scoliosis, soft abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness, no extremity edema or skin changes, and warm/dry skin with skin tears on the back.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.2K, elevated creatinine levels, metabolic alkalosis, and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 4789. Imaging studies reveal a CT head with high density in the left occipital area suggestive of a tiny intraventricular hemorrhage, no evidence of acute large"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She was admitted with episodic dyspnea, dynamic EKG changes, and significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries but showed right ventricular dilation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. A probable mass in the right atrium was also observed. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, and she has a history of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. There is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) or other respiratory issues. The patient has been placed on heparin gtt due to the right atrial clot. Metabolic alkalosis, elevated creatine kinase (CK), and acute renal failure are also noted. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Neurological examination is non-focal. A head CT scan showed tiny intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular white matter hypodensity, likely microangiopathic ischemic changes. The patient's condition is stable at present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia, along with the presence of a right atrial clot and elevated D-dimer levels, raise concerns for a possible PE."

   representing tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. No definite
   parenchymal or subdural hematoma.  Asymmetry of lateral ventricles with
   enlargement of right lateral ventricle likely chronic.  Extensive

   embolus)
   - [**Month/Day (2) **] - Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
   systolic function. Right ventricular dilation, moderate tricuspid
   regurgitation. and moderately elevated pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a probable mass in the right atrium. Discussed
   with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro), will
   transition to coumadin after head CT today
   - Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of micro hemorrhage in
   brain
   - Oxygen as needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function

   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of

   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 75 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: although the cta was
negative
 for
   pulmonary embolus, the findings of a clot in the RA, a dilated
   hypocontractile RV, and a small (underfilled) hyperdynamic LV are
   almost pathognomonic for PE.  We will continue to treat with heparin
   given the RA mass.  We will check a followup echo tomorrow to make sure
   that anticoagulation is not worsening her small pericardial effusion.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   DNR status discussed. DNR.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes.

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with episodic dyspnea and dynamic EKG changes following cardiac catheterization. The patient's clean coronaries indicate that there is no significant blockage in the coronary arteries. However, she has significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure, which suggests pulmonary hypertension. There is also a right atrial clot seen on echocardiogram, which could indicate a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient's CT scan does not show evidence of a large main pulmonary artery thrombus or PE/DVT. However, it is worth noting that the CT scan quality was not ideal, and the sensitivity and specificity for detecting PE were 90% and 95%, respectively. The presence of sub-segmental clots in the lungs may not have been captured on the CT scan. 

The patient has an intermediate pre-test probability of having a PE based on modified Wells criteria. The etiology of the patient's dyspnea is unclear at this point. It could be due to a possible PE, malignancy, pneumonia, myocarditis, or myopericarditis. 

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20K, which may indicate an infection or inflammation. This could be related to her recent pneumonia treatment. 

The patient also has mild gait changes consistent with a previous C"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient presents with episodic dyspnea, dynamic EKG changes, and a right atrial clot seen on echocardiogram. Although the CT scan does not show evidence of large main PA thrombus or PE/DVT, the presence of sub-segmental clots in the lungs suggests the possibility of PE. The patient's intermediate pre-test probability based on modified Wells criteria further supports this concern.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a significantly elevated white blood cell count on admission, which may indicate an ongoing infection. The patient's recent history of pneumonia and the presence of leukocytosis suggest a possible respiratory infection or post-infectious complication.

3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient shows signs of metabolic alkalosis, likely due to contraction alkalosis as the patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing BUN/creatinine. This condition needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.

4. Elevated CK levels: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated, indicating possible muscle damage or injury. The etiology of the elevated CK is unknown at this time, but potential causes include seizure, cerebral infarct, hypothyroidism, viral or inflammatory myositis, or medication-related side effects. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause"

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro).  Started on
   coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (stroke). She presented with episodic dyspnea and dynamic EKG changes, and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed clean coronaries but significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure. The patient has been experiencing tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Despite a negative CT scan for pulmonary embolism (PE), there is still a concern for PE due to the presence of sub-segmental clots in the lungs. The patient has leukocytosis, likely secondary to a recent pneumonia treated with antibiotics, and an elevated creatinine level indicating acute renal failure. Other issues include metabolic alkalosis, elevated CK levels without cardiac origin, minimal coronary artery disease, and sinus tachycardia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Despite the negative CT scan, there is still a concern for PE due to the patient's symptoms of dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia, as well as evidence of sub-segmental clots in the lungs.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to a recent pneumonia treated with antibiotics. Close monitoring of the WBC count is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro).  Started on
   coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on 4L oxygenating well
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile.  WBC decreased this AM from 21.2 to
   19.7.
   - Urine cx- no growth (final).
   - UA shows small leuks, 22 WBC with few bacteria
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 10 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and prior cerebrovascular accident. She presented with episodic dyspnea and dynamic EKG changes, which are now stable. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries but significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure. There is also a question of recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

The patient has leukocytosis on admission with a count of 20K, likely due to a recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. She also has elevated creatinine levels, possibly related to Lasix use at a rehab facility. Her kidney function is pre-renal, and she is showing signs of dehydration.

The patient has been placed on systemic anticoagulation with heparin due to a right atrial clot seen on imaging. She is also on coumadin 5mg starting from August 13th, and her INR needs to be maintained above 2.0. The patient's metabolic alkalosis is likely due to contraction alkalosis, and she has been given normal saline at 10 cc/hr for 2 liters.

The patient's elevated CK level is trending down and is not cardiac in origin. Other possible etiologies include seizure or cerebral infarct, hypothyroidism, viral myositis, inflammatory myositis, infection, or medication-related causes. 

The patient has a history of CVA"

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and a prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with episodic dyspnea and dynamic EKG changes, which were evaluated through cardiac catheterization showing clean coronaries but significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressure. There is also a question of recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

The patient has leukocytosis on admission with a count of 20K, which has decreased to 19.7 this morning. She has a history of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin and reports of possible left-sided infiltrate on CXR. She received one dose of ceftriaxone at the rehab facility and one dose of levaquin in the ED. The white count continues to be elevated.

There are concerns about acute renal failure, with baseline creatinine levels increasing from 1.5 to 1.8 on admission labs. The patient may be related to Lasix at the rehab facility. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are also increasing. She has metabolic alkalosis with a respiratory acidosis pattern on ABG, but the cause is unclear. The patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing BUN/creatinine.

The patient's cardiac catheterization showed minimal coronary artery disease, and her left ventricle has normal contractility. However, she has elevated jugular venous distention (J"

   Assessment and Plan
    Mrs. [**Known lastname 5881**] is an 85 yo F with PMH DM, HTN, Obesity, prior CVA
   presenting with episodic dyspnea with dynamic EKG changes now s/p
   cardiac catheterization with clean coronaries however significantly
   elevated PA pressure and questionable recent paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation...even though CT scan negative for PE as well as
   respiratory acidosis/metabolic alkalosis pattern inconsistent with PE,
   cannot rule out b/c of [**Known lastname **] findings and persistent clinical findings
   (tachypnea, tachycardia and hypoxia). Patient currently stable.
   .
   # Dyspnea: No evidence of large main PA thrombus on right heart cath,
   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Anticoagulated given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro).  Started on
   coumadin 5mg on [**8-13**].  Continue heparin gtt until INR >2.0.
   - CT head performed on [**8-13**] to assess for interval changes of micro
   hemorrhage in brain
   - Oxygen as needed- currently on
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea
   - [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from PFT
s to further assess lung function
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient with significant leukocytosis on admission with
   count of 20K. Hx of recent pneumonia treated with levaquin. Reports
   state this pneumonia was on the right side. CXR in ED with reports of
   possible left sided infiltrate. Pt recieved one dose ceftriaxone at
   rehab facility and one dose levaquin in [**Hospital1 19**] ED.  White count
   continues to be elevated
afebrile.  WBC decreased this AM from 21.2 to
   19.7.
   - Urine cx- no growth (final).
   - UA shows small leuks, 22 WBC with few bacteria
   - Blood cx pending
   - No antibiotics at this time
   - Will send stool if evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Hx of CVA: Daughter notes some mild gait changes [**2-14**] old CVA but no
   other lasting deficits. Daughter notes some changes over the past 2
   weeks with weak voice and overall weakness possibly slurred speech, but
   nothing specific.  Per daughter
s report head CT at [**Name (NI) **] hospital on
   [**7-28**] was unremarkable. Neuro exam non focal this AM
   - CT head with microhemorrhages
will repeat scan today to assess for
   interval changes as patient is on heparin gtt
   - Consider formal Neuro consult if scan shows progression
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing
   BUN/creatinine.
   - Will repeat ABG today to further assess acid/base disorder as
   respiratory acidosis is inconsistent with PE
   - IVFs today- Normal saline at 10 cc/hr for 2 liters
   .
   # Elevated CK:  Trending down [**0-0-**]. At this time etiology of
   elevated CK is unknown. CKMB not elevated so is not cardiac in origin.
   Other possible etiologies include Seizure or cerebral infarct,
   Hypothyroidism, Viral Myositis, Inflammatory myositis, Infection,
   medication related.
   - Trend CK
   - TSH normal
   - Infectious work up as below
   - Gentle hydration given ARF and contrast administration
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Minimal Coronary Artery Disease on Cath Report
   - ASA 81mg Daily
   .
   # PUMP: Per Cath Report. Left ventricle with nl contractility; Patient
   with elevated JVD to suggest Right heart failure in the setting of PE,
   but no lower extremity edema
  ECHO shows normal LVEF with normal PCWP.
   -  Will monitor for signs of fluid overload
   - Gentle hydration today as concern for hypovolemia causing dyspnea,
   tachycardia, tachypnea
   .
   # RHYTHM: Some question of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation at outside
   hospital. No atrial fibrillation on admission. Now Sinus Tachycardia
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Unknown baseline. 1.5 yesterday and 1.8 today on
   admission labs. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to Lasix at rehab facility.  Fractional
   excretion of Urea: 16.18 -> Pre-renal
   - Will start IVFs: 75 cc at NS for [**2115**] ml
   - Trend Creatinine
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lasix
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient normotensive at this time.
   - Monitor blood pressure

   or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. CT scan not ideal quality, but [**Last Name (un) 270**] 90% and
   spec 95%. Right atrial clot seen on [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) **] suggest several
   sub-segmental clots in lungs that may not have been seen on CT.
   Patient with intermediate pre-test probability based on modified [**Doctor Last Name **]
   criteria.  Score: 4.5
   - Etiology unclear at this point as to why patient has dyspnea
   - Still some concern for PE -> cannot rule out malignancy, or unknown
   PAF, but right atrial clot is an abnormal presentation for clot
   development.
   - Although, cannot rule out primary pulmonary process possible
   including pneumonia may not be ruled out as patient has leukocytosis.
   However, CT scan is not c/w current active pneumonia.
   - Also must consider myocarditis or myopericarditis, as EKG changes may
   be consistent with this diagnosis.
   - Continue heparin gtt given clot in right atrium (OK per Neuro), will
   transition to coumadin after head CT today
   - Repeat CT head to assess for interval changes of micro hemorrhage in
   brain
   - Oxygen as needed
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider UPEP/SPEP/guaiac stools
   - Can consider pulmonary consult if cannot find etiology of her dyspnea

   # Metabolic Alkalosis: ABG [**2124-8-12**] shows a respiratory acidosis, today
   patient quite tachypneic. Metabolic alkalosis likely due to contraction
   alkalosis as patient appears dehydrated and has an increasing

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with episodic dyspnea, dynamic EKG changes, and was found to have significantly elevated pulmonary artery pressures. There were also indications of possible recent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed clean coronaries but elevated PA pressures. She is currently stable.

The patient's dyspnea could not be explained by large main pulmonary artery thrombus on right heart cath or PE/DVT on CT/Ultrasound. However, a right atrial clot was seen, suggesting sub-segmental clots in the lungs that may not have been detected on CT. The patient has an intermediate pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism (PE), and further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Other possible etiologies include pneumonia, myocarditis, or myopericarditis.

The patient also has leukocytosis, possibly related to recent pneumonia treated with antibiotics. Her white blood cell count remains elevated. A CT head will be repeated today to assess for interval changes, as the patient is on heparin gtt. Neurological examination is non-focal, and a formal neuro consult may be considered if there is progression.

The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to contraction alkalosis as she appears dehydrated and has an increasing BUN/creatinine"
