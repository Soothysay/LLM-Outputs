   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe, steroid and trach-dependent
   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB.
   #. Hypotension: DDX includes sepsis, GI bleed, and tension PTX. Patient
   is febrile, tachycardic with a leukocytosis, with increasing
   respiratory distress (hypoxia), increased secretions from her
   tracheostomy and a CXR concerning for multifocal PNA.  UA is also
   positive.  Her chronic pseudomonal colonization and trach dependence is
   concerning for another [**Known lastname 3396**].  However, she has had dark, guaiac positive
   stools, with a HCT drop from 22.6--20 despite getting part of her first
   unit of pRBCs.  The shift on her CXR is improving, making a tension PTX
   less likely.
   -Will treat with vanc/zosyn for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3396**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] double cover for
   pseudomonas with gentamycin.  Patient will need vanc and gent levels.
   Past sputum cultures indicate that her pseudomonas is sensitive to
   zosyn
   -Will obtain sputum, urine, and blood cultures, and adjust abx
   accordingly.
   -Will provide fluid boluses to maintain a CVP 8-12, with q1H CVPs from
   RIJ
   -BP stable off levophed
   - will plan on 1wk course of antibiotics
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) -No history of
   GIB in the past.  HCT is below baseline of 30, currently 20 from 22.6
   on admission despite blood transfusion.  Has had recent admissions for
   sepsis, which would put her at risk for stress ulcers.  Recently
   stopped ASA and prednisone.  Exam is significant for epigastric
   tenderness
   -Type and crossmatch active, access (PIV and RIJ), transfuse for
   falling Hct or inappropriate bump
   - Hct has been stable since last transfusion. Will check another q6,
   then if stable space out to q8.
   -IV PPI drip
   -GI following, no plan to scope until hemodynamically stable as Hct
   stable
   -Hold ASA
H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   - continue vent via trach, check PIP, Plateu pressure as necessary
   .
   #. Diarrhea: patient had been having diarrhea at rehab, C. diff
   negative, but had been treated empirically with flagyl.
   -will send c. diff
   -continue flagyl for now, contact rehab to define a course
   .
   #. Pneumothorax: currently continues to improve on CXR
   -Will monitor with serial CXR's if her ventilatory/oxygenation needs
   change
   -Thoracics is following.
   .
   #. COPD
   -Continue home fluticasone, albuterol, ipratropium
   -no need for steroids
   .
   #. CAD
   -Continue home simvastatin
   -Hold lisinopril given transient hypotension, and ASA given GIB
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**], a 70-year-old female with severe, steroid and trach-dependent COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections, presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB). She is currently in the ICU and requires multiple interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can be attributed to sepsis, GI bleed, or tension pneumothorax (PTX). However, the increasing respiratory distress, hypoxia, and a CXR concerning for multifocal pneumonia suggest another possible complication - pneumonia.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has experienced dark, guaiac-positive stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration despite receiving a blood transfusion. This indicates active bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Risk factors include recent admissions for sepsis, discontinuation of aspirin and prednisone, and epigastric tenderness on examination.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to her COPD. She requires mechanical ventilation via a tracheostomy and needs close monitoring of peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and plateau pressure as necessary.

4. Pneumothorax: Although the patient's pneumothorax appears to be improving on CXR, she should continue to be monitored with serial chest X-rays if her ventilatory or"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**], a 70-year-old woman with severe, steroid and tracheostomy-dependent COPD and chronic pseudomonas colonization, presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has a history of recent admissions for sepsis, full-strength aspirin and prednisone use, and recurrent pulmonary infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] has a low hemoglobin level (Hct) despite receiving a blood transfusion, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. She is at risk for stress ulcers due to recent sepsis and taking aspirin and prednisone, which increase the risk for peptic ulcer disease. The patient's epigastric tenderness suggests possible peptic ulcer disease as a cause of the GIB.
2. Respiratory Failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] has chronic respiratory failure, evident from her tracheostomy dependence and worsening respiratory distress (hypoxia). Her increasing secretions from the tracheostomy and concern for multifocal pneumonia raise the possibility of another respiratory infection, potentially involving pseudomonas given her chronic colonization.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (BP) and tachycardia suggest sepsis as a potential cause of hypotension. The decrease"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe, steroid and trach-dependent
   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB.
   #. Hypotension: DDX includes sepsis, GI bleed, and tension PTX. Patient
   is febrile, tachycardic with a leukocytosis, with increasing
   respiratory distress (hypoxia), increased secretions from her
   tracheostomy and a CXR concerning for multifocal PNA.  UA is also
   positive.  Her chronic pseudomonal colonization and trach dependence is
   concerning for another [**Known lastname 3396**].  However, she has had dark, guaiac positive
   stools, with a HCT drop from 22.6--20 despite getting part of her first
   unit of pRBCs.  The shift on her CXR is improving, making a tension PTX
   less likely.
   -Will treat with vanc/zosyn for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3396**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] double cover for
   pseudomonas with gentamycin.  Patient will need vanc and gent levels.
   Past sputum cultures indicate that her pseudomonas is sensitive to
   zosyn
   -Will obtain sputum, urine, and blood cultures, and adjust abx
   accordingly.
   -Will provide fluid boluses to maintain a CVP 8-12, with q1H CVPs from
   RIJ
   -BP stable off levophed
   - will plan on 1wk course of antibiotics

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) -No history of
   GIB in the past.  HCT is below baseline of 30, currently 20 from 22.6
   on admission despite blood transfusion.  Has had recent admissions for
   sepsis, which would put her at risk for stress ulcers.  Recently
   stopped ASA and prednisone.  Exam is significant for epigastric
   tenderness
   -Type and crossmatch active, access (PIV and RIJ), transfuse for
   falling Hct or inappropriate bump
   - Hct has been stable since last transfusion. Will check another q6,
   then if stable space out to q8.
   -IV PPI drip
   -GI following, no plan to scope until hemodynamically stable as Hct
   stable
   -Hold ASA

H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   - continue vent via trach, check PIP, Plateu pressure as necessary
   #. Diarrhea: patient had been having diarrhea at rehab, C. diff
   negative, but had been treated empirically with flagyl.
   -will send c. diff
   -continue flagyl for now, contact rehab to define a course
   #. Pneumothorax: currently continues to improve on CXR
   -Will monitor with serial CXR's if her ventilatory/oxygenation needs
   change
   -Thoracics is following.
   #. COPD
   -Continue home fluticasone, albuterol, ipratropium
   -no need for steroids
   #. CAD
   -Continue home simvastatin
   -Hold lisinopril given transient hypotension, and ASA given GIB
   #. Anxiety/depression: continue home citalopram, hold clonazapam in the
   setting of hypotension
   #. Osteoporosis: continue home calcium and vitamin D
   #. Chronic Pain: continue fentanyl patch

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections. She presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension and tachycardia. Her respiratory status shows worsening respiratory distress with increased secretions from her tracheostomy and a chest X-ray concerning for multifocal pneumonia. The presence of guaiac positive stools suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, and her HCT drop from 22.6 to 20 despite receiving a blood transfusion indicates ongoing blood loss.

The patient's laboratory results reveal leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.2 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 31, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Her other lab values are within normal limits.

Based on the assessment, the patient's primary medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: This could be due to sepsis, gastrointestinal bleed, or tension pneumothorax. However, the tension pneumothorax is less likely given the improving shift on her chest X-ray.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia indicate worsening respiratory failure. Chronic pseudomonal colonization and tracheal dependence increase the risk of respiratory infections.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity:"

   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB.
   #. Hypotension: DDX includes sepsis, GI bleed, and tension PTX. Patient
   is febrile, tachycardic with a leukocytosis, with increasing
   respiratory distress (hypoxia), increased secretions from her
   tracheostomy and a CXR concerning for multifocal PNA.  UA is also
   positive.  Her chronic pseudomonal colonization and trach dependence is
   concerning for another VAP.  However, she has had dark, guaiac positive
   stools, with a HCT drop from 22.6--20 despite getting part of her first
   unit of pRBCs.  The shift on her CXR is improving, making a tension PTX
   less likely.
   -Will treat with vanc/zosyn for a VAP
   -f/u sputum, urine, and blood cultures, and adjust abx accordingly.
   - will plan on 1wk course of antibiotics

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) -No history of
   GIB in the past.  HCT is below baseline of 30, currently 20 from 22.6
   on admission despite blood transfusion.  Has had recent admissions for
   sepsis, which would put her at risk for stress ulcers.  Recently
   stopped ASA and prednisone.  Exam is significant for epigastric
   tenderness
   -Type and crossmatch active, access (PIV and RIJ), transfuse for
   falling Hct or inappropriate bump
   - Hct has been stable since last transfusion. Will check [**Hospital1 **] hct
   -IV PPI drip
   -GI following, no plan to scope currently
   -Hold ASA

H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   - continue vent via trach, check PIP, Plateu pressure as necessary
   #. Diarrhea: patient had been having diarrhea at rehab, C. diff
   negative, but had been treated empirically with flagyl.
   -will send c. diff
   -continue flagyl for now, contact rehab to define a course
   #. Pneumothorax: currently continues to improve on CXR
   -Will monitor with serial CXR's if her ventilatory/oxygenation needs
   change
   -Thoracics is following.
   #. COPD
   -Continue home fluticasone, albuterol, ipratropium
   -no need for steroids
   #. CAD
   -Continue home simvastatin
   -Hold lisinopril given transient hypotension, and ASA given GIB
   #. Anxiety/depression: continue home citalopram, hold clonazapam in the
   setting of hypotension
   #. Osteoporosis: continue home calcium and vitamin D
   #. Chronic Pain: continue fentanyl patch

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 3581], a 70-year-old female with severe, steroid and trach-dependent COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections, presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has been experiencing worsening respiratory distress, increased secretions from her tracheostomy, and a chest X-ray concerning for multifocal pneumonia. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, and her blood culture is positive. She also has signs of impaired skin integrity, bilateral pitting pedal edema, and cachexia with ecchymoses at her left shoulder and bilateral lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 119/57 mmHg to 70s/30s. This could be due to sepsis, gastrointestinal bleed, or tension pneumothorax. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient has a history of severe COPD and chronic respiratory failure. She requires ventilatory support through her tracheostomy and may need further interventions to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient exhibits signs of impaired skin integrity, which could lead to pressure ulcers or infections. Regular skin assessments and appropriate preventive measures should be implemented.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe, steroid and trach-dependent
   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): DDX included sepsis, GI bleed, and tension
   PTX. See plans below.
   - BP resolved, will restart home lisinopril.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   -          CXR with multifocal pneumonia and sputum cultures growing
   pseudomonas. Has been afebrile, but WBCs trending up
   -          Treating with zosyn (resistant to gent). Add meropenem if
   clinically worsens for double coverage. Plan for 1 week course.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) -No history of
   GIB in the past.  Recently stopped ASA and prednisone.  Exam is
   significant for epigastric tenderness. Hct stable x 48hrs.
   -Type and crossmatch active, access (PIV and RIJ), transfuse for
   falling Hct or inappropriate bump
   - Hct has been stable since last transfusion. Will spread checks to
   q24hrs.
   -IV PPI drip
   -GI following, f/u recs
 will need scope soon.
   -Hold ASA
 [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (PROCEDURE RELATED, BAROTRAUMA):
   stable on CXR, not affecting ventilator numbers
   -Will monitor with serial CXR's if her ventilatory/oxygenation needs
   change
   -Thoracics is following, no plan for pigtail unless clinically worsens.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   -          continue vent via trach, check PIP, Plateau pressure as
   necessary
   -          will have thoracics change trach today as difficult to
   suction.
   #. Tachycardia: Possibly due to pain, benzo withdrawal. Restarting
   fentanyl and clonazepam. Does not seem to be hypovolemic.
   #. COPD
   -Continue home fluticasone, albuterol, ipratropium
   -no need for steroids
   #. CAD
   -Continue home simvastatin, restart lisinopril
   - hold ASA given GIB
   #. Anxiety/depression: continue home citalopram and clonazapam
   #. Osteoporosis: continue home calcium and vitamin D
   #. Chronic Pain: restart fentanyl patch for chronic abdominal pain.
   Known to have partially obstructed intrarenal aorta but not surgical
   candidate previously. Can tbw vascular after pt scoped, if ischemic
   colitis still possibility for cause of pain.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe, steroid and trach-dependent
   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): DDX includes sepsis, GI bleed, and tension
   PTX. Patient is febrile, tachycardic with a leukocytosis, with
   increasing respiratory distress (hypoxia), increased secretions from
   her tracheostomy and a CXR concerning for multifocal PNA.  UA is also
   positive.  Her chronic pseudomonal colonization and trach dependence is
   concerning for another VAP.  However, she has had dark, guaiac positive
   stools, with a HCT drop from 22.6--20 despite getting part of her first
   unit of pRBCs.  The shift on her CXR is improving, making a tension PTX
   less likely.
   -Will treat with vanc/zosyn for a VAP (off gent, plan to add meropenem
   if worsens)
   -f/u sputum, urine, and blood cultures, and adjust abx accordingly.
   - will plan on 1wk course of antibiotics

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) -No history of
   GIB in the past.  HCT is below baseline of 30, currently 20 from 22.6
   on admission despite blood transfusion.  Has had recent admissions for
   sepsis, which would put her at risk for stress ulcers.  Recently
   stopped ASA and prednisone.  Exam is significant for epigastric
   tenderness
   -Type and crossmatch active, access (PIV and RIJ), transfuse for
   falling Hct or inappropriate bump

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**], a 70-year-old female with a history of severe, steroid and tracheostomy-dependent COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections, presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments for her conditions. Her vital signs include tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxia. The patient's physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, dry mucous membranes, coarse ventilated breath sounds, audible expiratory wheezes, hypoactive bowel sounds, and bilateral pitting pedal edema. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. She also has a positive urine analysis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension (not in shock): Possible causes include sepsis, GI bleed, and tension pneumothorax. The patient is febrile, tachycardic, and has leukocytosis. She is experiencing increased respiratory distress, hypoxia, increased secretions from her tracheostomy, and a chest X-ray indicating multifocal pneumonia. Additionally, she has a positive urine analysis, suggesting another ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, her symptoms are consistent with another possible diagnosis of tension pneumothorax, although her chest"

   pneumonia and sputum cultures growing pseudomonas. Has been afebrile,
   but WBCs trending up now 19.5
   - Will change zosyn to meropenem as likely not treating pseudomonas
   - will recheck  c.diff, ua/ucx for other sources of infxn, but likely
   pseudomonas

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) -No history of
   GIB in the past.  Recently stopped ASA and prednisone.  Exam is
   significant for epigastric tenderness. Hct stable x 48hrs.

   falling Hct or inappropriate bump
   - Hct has been stable since last transfusion. Will spread checks to
   q24hrs.
   -IV PPI drip
   -GI following, f/u recs
 will need scope soon.
   -Hold ASA
   #. Tachycardia: Possibly due to pain, benzo withdrawal. Restarting
   fentanyl and clonazepam. Does not seem to be hypovolemic. Also possibly
   from fevers.
   - will try 500ml bolus

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of severe, steroid and tracheostomy-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections. She presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

The patient has undergone a bronchoscopy, during which her tracheostomy tube was replaced due to difficulties with suctioning. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently receiving medications including pantoprazole, fentanyl, clonazepam, meropenem, and others.

Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 113 bpm and hypotension with a blood pressure of 117/50 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, dry mucous membranes, coarse ventilated breath sounds with audible expiratory wheezes, hypoactive bowel sounds, and bilateral pitting pedal edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe, steroid and trach-dependent
   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): DDX included sepsis, GI bleed, and tension
   PTX. See plans below.
   - BP resolved, will restart home lisinopril.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   -          CXR with multifocal pneumonia and sputum cultures growing
   pseudomonas. Has been afebrile, but WBCs trending up
   -          Treating with zosyn (resistant to gent). Add meropenem if
   clinically worsens for double coverage. Plan for 1 week course.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) -No history of
   GIB in the past.  Recently stopped ASA and prednisone.  Exam is
   significant for epigastric tenderness. Hct stable x 48hrs.
   -Type and crossmatch active, access (PIV and RIJ), transfuse for
   falling Hct or inappropriate bump
   - Hct has been stable since last transfusion. Will spread checks to
   q24hrs.
   -IV PPI drip
   -GI following, f/u recs
 will need scope soon.
   -Hold ASA
 [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (PROCEDURE RELATED, BAROTRAUMA):
   stable on CXR, not affecting ventilator numbers
   -Will monitor with serial CXR's if her ventilatory/oxygenation needs
   change
   -Thoracics is following, no plan for pigtail unless clinically worsens.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   -          continue vent via trach, check PIP, Plateau pressure as
   necessary
   -          will have thoracics change trach today as difficult to
   suction.
   #. Tachycardia: Possibly due to pain, benzo withdrawal. Restarting
   fentanyl and clonazepam. Does not seem to be hypovolemic.
   #. COPD
   -Continue home fluticasone, albuterol, ipratropium
   -no need for steroids
   #. CAD
   -Continue home simvastatin, restart lisinopril
   - hold ASA given GIB
   #. Anxiety/depression: continue home citalopram and clonazapam
   #. Osteoporosis: continue home calcium and vitamin D
   #. Chronic Pain: restart fentanyl patch for chronic abdominal pain.
   Known to have partially obstructed intrarenal aorta but not surgical
   candidate previously. Can tbw vascular after pt scoped, if ischemic
   colitis still possibility for cause of pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe, steroid and trach-dependent
   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)- CXR with multifocal
   pneumonia and sputum cultures growing pseudomonas. Has been afebrile,
   but WBCs trending up now 19.5
   - Will change zosyn to meropenem as likely not treating pseudomonas
   - will recheck  c.diff, ua/ucx for other sources of infxn, but likely
   pseudomonas

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB) -No history of
   GIB in the past.  Recently stopped ASA and prednisone.  Exam is
   significant for epigastric tenderness. Hct stable x 48hrs.
   -Type and crossmatch active, access (PIV and RIJ), transfuse for
   falling Hct or inappropriate bump
   - Hct has been stable since last transfusion. Will spread checks to
   q24hrs.
   -IV PPI drip
   -GI following, f/u recs
 will need scope soon.
   -Hold ASA
   #. Tachycardia: Possibly due to pain, benzo withdrawal. Restarting
   fentanyl and clonazepam. Does not seem to be hypovolemic. Also possibly
   from fevers.
   - will try 500ml bolus
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): DDX included sepsis, GI bleed, and tension
   PTX. See plans below.
   - BP resolved, on home lisinopril.
 [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (PROCEDURE RELATED, BAROTRAUMA):
   stable on CXR, not affecting ventilator numbers
   -Will monitor with serial CXR's if her ventilatory/oxygenation needs
   change
   -Thoracics is following, no plan for pigtail unless clinically worsens.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC-  thoracics changed trach today as
   difficult to suction. Now breathing well.
   - continue vent via trach, check PIP, Plateau pressure as necessary
   .
   #. COPD
   -Continue home fluticasone, albuterol, ipratropium
   -no need for steroids
   #. CAD
   -Continue home simvastatin, restart lisinopril
   - hold ASA given GIB
   #. Anxiety/depression: continue home citalopram and clonazapam
   #. Osteoporosis: continue home calcium and vitamin D
   #. Chronic Pain: restart fentanyl patch for chronic abdominal pain.
   Known to have partially obstructed intrarenal aorta but not surgical
   candidate previously. Can tbw vascular after pt scoped, if ischemic
   colitis still possibility for cause of pain.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections. She presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as evidenced by her worsening symptoms and sputum cultures growing pseudomonas. The patient also has upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely caused by a peptic ulcer, given her recent discontinuation of aspirin and prednisone. 

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, possibly due to pain, benzodiazepine withdrawal, or fever. Hypotension has been resolved, and the differential diagnosis includes sepsis, GIB, and tension pneumothorax. The patient's respiratory failure is chronic and managed with continuous ventilation through a tracheostomy. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic pain, anxiety/depression, osteoporosis, and coronary artery disease. She is currently being treated with various medications, including antibiotics, analgesics, antipsychotics, antihypertensives, and cholesterol-lowering agents. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further respiratory deterioration due to VAP. Additionally, there is a concern for worsening GIB and the development of complications such as melena or hematemesis. The patient's chronic pseudomonas colonization increases"

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections. She presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP), and there is a concern for different bacteria as she has been on meropenem. She also may have developed an abscess or collection not covered by antibiotics. 

The patient's gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) is currently stable, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) did not reveal any obvious source. However, gastritis and periPEG erythema were observed, so the patient is being transfused for falling hematocrit (Hct) and receiving IV pantoprazole. 

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and she is now on home lisinopril. She also has chronic respiratory failure, which is improving, and her tracheostomy was recently changed due to difficulty in suctioning. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities including COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), anxiety/depression, osteoporosis, and chronic pain. She is receiving various medications to manage these conditions. 

Nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers are being addressed in the ICU. The patient's communication status is set to full code, and her"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe, steroid and trach-dependent
   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB. Found to have multifocal pseudomonal pneumonia initially
   responsive to Zosyn. WBC plateaued pt switched to Meropenem. She then
   developed clinical worsening (increased suctioning and hypoxia) and new
   infiltrate with GNR on gram stain.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)-
   - as new infiltrate developed while on Meropenem, concerning for
   resistant pseudomonas or new bacteria. GS without
   - No GP on gram stain, thus no vanco
   - start Amikacin for double pseudomonal coverage per ID.
   - C diff several days ago neg, and having minimal stool.
   - urine cultures and blood cultures if spikes.
   - recheck CXR re CHF, PTX, PE, fever source.
 TACHYCARDIA, HYPOTENSION: Likely due to multiple pulmonary
   infections/fevers. Has not responded to IVF, restarting benzo and pain
   control.
   - can check ABG given hypoxia and metabolic alkalosis.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
 No further
   bleeding, Hct stable.
   - EGD without obvious source
 gastritis and periPEG erythema
   - transfuse for falling Hct, checking q24hrs.
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   -Hold ASA
 [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (PROCEDURE RELATED, BAROTRAUMA):
   improving on CXRs
RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC-  thoracics changed trach with
   improvement of suctioning. Now breathing well.
   - continue to attempt to wean vent and diurese.
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   -Continue home fluticasone, albuterol, ipratropium
   -no need for steroids
   #. CAD
   -Continue home simvastatin, restart lisinopril
   - hold ASA given GIB
   #. Anxiety/depression: continue home citalopram and clonazapam
   #. Osteoporosis: continue home calcium and vitamin D
   #. Chronic Pain: restart fentanyl patch for chronic abdominal pain.
   Known to have partially obstructed intrarenal aorta but not surgical
   candidate previously. Can tbw vascular after pt scoped, if ischemic

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70-year-old female with a history of severe, steroid and tracheostomy-dependent COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections. She presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient initially showed improvement with Zosyn but then developed clinical worsening, new infiltrate with GNR on gram stain, and is now being treated with meropenem. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator acquired (VAP) - The patient has developed a new infiltrate while on meropenem, which may indicate resistant pseudomonas or a new bacterial infection.
2. Tachycardia and hypotension - These symptoms are likely due to multiple pulmonary infections and fevers. The patient has not responded to intravenous fluids, so benzodiazepines and pain control have been restarted.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed (GIB), upper (melena) - There is no further bleeding, but the patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been performed without finding an obvious source, and the patient has been transfused for falling Hct. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been initiated, and aspirin has been held.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD, chronic respiratory failure, and a history of recurrent pseudomonas infections. She was admitted with a pseudomonas pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleed (PEG irritation). She requires ventilator support and has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's medical history includes respiratory failure, chronic tachycardia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) without signs of ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas PNA: The patient remains on meropenem/amikacin, and follow-up sputum sensitivities will be monitored.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require ventilator support and has auto-PEEP. The PEEP will be increased to 8.
3. COPD: The patient is on albuterol/atrovent.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's fluid status should be evaluated, and the central venous pressure (CVP) should be checked.
5. CAD: No symptoms of ischemia are present. The rest of the plan is per the ICU team.

   responsive to Zosyn. WBC plateaued pt switched to Meropenem. She then
   developed clinical worsening (increased suctioning and hypoxia) and new
   infiltrate with GNR on gram stain.
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)- as new infiltrate
   developed while on Meropenem, concerning for resistant pseudomonas or
   new bacteria. GS without . No GP on gram stain, thus no vanco. Started
   Amikacin for double pseudomonal coverage per ID. C diff several days
   ago neg, and having minimal stool.
   - urine cultures and blood cultures if spikes.
   - cont amikacin/meropenem double coverage
   - will f/u new sensitivies
 TACHYCARDIA, HYPOTENSION: Likely due to multiple pulmonary
   infections/fevers. Has not responded to IVF, restarting benzo and pain
   control.
   - can check ABG given hypoxia and metabolic alkalosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe, steroid and tracheostomy-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections.
2. She presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
3. She has developed multifocal pseudomonal pneumonia initially responsive to Zosyn but then switched to Meropenem due to a plateau in white blood cell count.
4. The patient has shown clinical worsening with increased suctioning and hypoxia, along with a new infiltrate with Gram-negative rods (GNR) on gram stain.
5. She is currently on amikacin for double pseudomonal coverage as recommended by the infectious disease (ID) team.
6. The patient also has tachycardia and hypotension, which are likely due to multiple pulmonary infections and fevers. She has not responded to intravenous fluids (IVF), so benzo and pain control have been restarted.
7. There is an ongoing concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP) due to new infiltrates while on Meropenem.
8. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, and thoracics have been changed with improvement in suctioning.
9. She has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with"

She initially had multifocal pseudomonal pneumonia responsive to Zosyn but then developed clinical worsening and a new infiltrate with Gram-negative rods (GNR) on gram stain. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count plateaued, and she was switched to Meropenem. However, she continued to experience increased suctioning and hypoxia, indicating ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The new infiltrate is concerning for resistant pseudomonas or a new bacteria. The patient is currently being treated with amikacin for double pseudomonal coverage. Her tachycardia and hypotension are likely due to multiple pulmonary infections/fevers. She also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, chronic respiratory failure, anxiety/depression, osteoporosis, and chronic pain. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, steroids, bronchodilators, statins, antiplatelet agents, and pain medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory failure, and recent admission for severe Pseudomonas pneumonia. She remains critically ill and requires ventilator support. There have been slight improvements in secretions and lung examination compared to the previous day. The patient is on antibiotics as recommended by the infectious disease team. A chest X-ray is needed for reevaluation. Medications for COPD management, such as albendazole and atrovent, along with fluticasone, will be continued. Other plans are in place according to the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Barotrauma: The high pressures used in mechanical ventilation can lead to injury in the lung tissue, causing barotrauma.
3. Pseudomonas infection: The patient's previous infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa could potentially recur if appropriate measures are not taken.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to the current illness and treatment interventions.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has evidence of impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of melena suggests a risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Hypotension: The patient's"

   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB. Found to have multifocal pseudomonal pneumonia initially
   responsive to Zosyn. WBC plateaued pt switched to Meropenem. She then
   developed clinical worsening (increased suctioning and hypoxia) and new

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of severe COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections. She presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including Zosyn, Meropenem, and Amikacin, but her condition has not improved. She also has a history of chronic pain, anxiety, osteoporosis, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's current assessment includes:
1. Bacteremia with gran-negative rods, presumed to be of pulmonary origin.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with new infiltrate developed while on Meropenem, concerning for resistant pseudomonas or new bacteria.
3. Tachycardia and hypotension likely due to multiple pulmonary infections/fevers.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with no obvious source on EGD, stable Hct.
5. Chronic respiratory failure, improving on CXRs, attempting to wean vent and diurese.
6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation.
7. Anxiety, osteoporosis, and chronic pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status due to VAP or resistant bacteria.
2. Development of septic shock due to bacteremia and GIB.
3. Worsening of COPD exacerbation leading to respiratory failure.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 3581] is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of severe, steroid and tracheostomy-dependent COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections. She presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was initially treated with Zosyn for multifocal pseudomonal pneumonia but showed clinical worsening and developed a new infiltrate with gram-negative rods (GNR). Amikacin was added for double coverage. The patient's white blood cell count plateaued, and she continues to have a high respiratory rate with inadequate oxygenation despite being on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for GNR, indicating bacteremia. This could be a result of her severe COPD causing pockets of infection that are difficult to treat with antibiotics.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, which may be ventilator-acquired. She will continue current antibiotics per Infectious Disease consultation.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has melena and GIB. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) did not reveal an obvious source, and she is being transfused for falling hemoglobin levels.
4. Hospital-Acquired Condition (Barotrauma): The patient had a thoracic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70F with a PMH s/f severe, steroid and trach-dependent
   COPD, with chronic pseudomonas colonization and recurrent pulmonary
   infections, who presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia,
   and a GIB. Found to have multifocal pseudomonal pneumonia initially
   responsive to Zosyn. WBC plateaued pt switched to Meropenem. She then
   developed clinical worsening (increased suctioning and hypoxia) and new
   infiltrate with GNR on gram stain, continued to not improve and
   amikacin added for double coverage.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3581**] is a 70-year-old female with a history of severe, steroid and tracheostomy-dependent COPD, chronic pseudomonas colonization, and recurrent pulmonary infections. She presents with fevers, altered mental status, hypoxia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient initially had multifocal pseudomonal pneumonia responsive to Zosyn but then developed clinical worsening with a new infiltrate showing Gram-negative rods (GNR), for which amikacin was added for double coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The presence of GNR suggests a possible bacterial infection, which could lead to bacteremia if not properly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to severe COPD, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and there is a possibility of re-bleeding or ongoing bleeding.
5. Multidrug-Resistant Infection: The patient has a multidrug-resistant infection, making it challenging to treat effectively.
6. Line-related Infection: The use of central lines increases the risk of line-related infections.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe COPD, currently experiencing respiratory failure, GI bleed, and pneumonia. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 92/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm extremities. 

Her laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.5 K/uL, and elevated lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L. Blood cultures have grown Gram-negative rods, likely pseudomonas secondary to pneumonia. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for GNR bacteremia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis, and anemia. She is already receiving meropenem and amikacin, and the plan is to check sensitivities to doribax and colistin. The patient's respiratory status is stable, so it is planned to push down pressure support ventilation (PSV) and consider trial of spontaneous breathing as she improves. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further respiratory deterioration due to her underlying COPD and VAP. The ongoing GI bleed may also pose a risk of continued"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) GNR bacteremia:
   Likely pseudomonas secondary to pneumonia.
   Continue current antibiotics pending ID consult.
   2) VAP:
   Respiratory status is stable.
   Continue meropenem and amikacin.  Await further sensies for colistin,
   darbopenem.
   3) Leukocytosis:
   Most likely source continues to be pneumonia.
   Check differential on WBC.
   4) Anemia:
   Hct stable.  No further signs of GI bleed.
