   Patient is a 49 y/o F w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest who p/w
   unrevascularized STEMI and cardiogenic shock with diffuclty weaning
   from IABP and pressors.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: [**2-8**] to MI.  Currently on IABP and off dopa.
   - Will attempt to wean IABP as tolerated following eval of OSH records
   to determine if required for coronary perfusion;
   - may need dobutamine for afterload reduction if decide to wean IABP,
   goal MAP 60, UOP 20cc/hr
   - heparin gtt and CXR daily with balloon
   - echo today to evaluate for progression of wall motion abnormality, to
   eval for anterior wall viability
   - Check pulses frequently with IABP in place
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p STEMI
   - Continue IABP to increase coronary perfusion
   - Will eval outside hospital cath reports, may need intervention here
   if determine anterior wall has viability
   - aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs)
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, Intubated.
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - wean sedation and attempt RISBI later today
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN
   # Pneumonia:. afebrile overnight, WBCs stable, CXR c/w edema. Holding
   ABX for now, will start empirically for HAP or VAP if has leukocytosis
   or CXR findings of infiltrate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. He presented with an unrevascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been difficult to wean from intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently on IABP and off dopamine. The plan is to attempt to wean the IABP as tolerated, considering the oxygen saturation history (OSH) records to determine if required for coronary perfusion. If weaning is successful, dobutamine may be needed for afterload reduction, aiming for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 and urine output (UOP) of 20 cc/hr.
2. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now post-ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient will continue on IABP to increase coronary perfusion. Evaluation of outside hospital catheterization reports will be done, and if anterior wall viability is determined, intervention may be required. Medications include aspirin 325, Plavix 75mg, Lipitor 80, and heparin gtt. A1c check is also planned, along with transfusion to hematocrit (HCT) >30 (after"

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with an unrevascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock, which required intubation and initiation of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient's condition has been unstable, making it difficult to wean him off the IABP and pressors.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 122/75 to 94/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin, midazolam (versed), fentanyl, and others.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of troponin T, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, lactate acid, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and slightly low levels of albumin and potassium. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, while his hematocrit is lower than normal.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including cardiogenic shock, severe multivessel coronary artery disease, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, lower extremity pulses that require close monitoring due to intermittent loss of pulses at the onset of symptoms, transaminitis, peripheral vascular disease, and an"

   Patient is a 49 y/o F w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest who p/w
   unrevascularized STEMI and cardiogenic shock with diffuclty weaning
   from IABP and pressors.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: [**2-8**] to MI.  Currently on IABP and off dopa.
   - Will attempt to wean IABP as tolerated following eval of OSH records
   to determine if required for coronary perfusion;
   - may need dobutamine for afterload reduction if decide to wean IABP,
   goal MAP 60, UOP 20cc/hr
   - heparin gtt and CXR daily with balloon
   - echo today to evaluate for progression of wall motion abnormality, to
   eval for anterior wall viability
   - Check pulses frequently with IABP in place
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p STEMI
   - Continue IABP to increase coronary perfusion
   - Will eval outside hospital cath reports, may need intervention here
   if determine anterior wall has viability
   - aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs)
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, Intubated.
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - wean sedation and attempt RISBI later today
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN
   # Pneumonia:. afebrile overnight, WBCs stable, CXR c/w edema. Holding
   ABX for now, will start empirically for HAP or VAP if has leukocytosis
   or CXR findings of infiltrate
   #. Normocytic Anemia:.  Likely IABP related.

   Chart reviewed.  Patient interviewed and examined on CCU rounds with
   the team.  I have also personally reviewed her cardiac catheterization
   films from the OSH.  I agree with the [**2140-4-30**] notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 569**] and
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5077**], including their H+P, A+P.  Acute anterior myocardial
   infarction several days ago that appears secondary to SVG to LAD
   occlusion.  Her mid LAD is occluded.  She has a proximal LAD stenosis
   that supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on cath film appears to
   supply a viable, contracting territory.  Her SVG to OM has in stent
   restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is patent.
   The patient is currently on IABP with acceptable hemodynamics and
   oxygen saturations.  We plan diuresis, pressor support
   (dopamine/dobutamine) as needed as we attempt to wean IABP.  There is
   no indication at this time for urgent cath or PCI.  90 minutes spent on
   patient critical care.  ICU level care due to intubation and IABP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure. She presented with unrevascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been difficult to wean from intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pressors.

Assessment and plan:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently on IABP and off dopamine. The plan is to wean the IABP as tolerated and may require dobutamine. Heparin will be given through the balloon, and an echocardiogram will be performed.
2. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has severe multivessel disease, now complicated by STEMI. The plan includes aspirin 325 mg, Plavix 75 mg, Lipitor 80 mg, and heparin gtt. A1c levels will be checked, and hematocrit (HCT) should be maintained above 30%. A return to the lab for further evaluation may be considered.
3. Respiratory: The patient is intubated. The plan includes fentanyl/versed sedation and weaning off sedation to attempt rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). 
4. Transaminitis: This is presumably ischemic, and enzyme trends will be monitored with further workup as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She presented with an unrevascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She has difficulty weaning from intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pressors. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic shock. She has multiple medical complications including transaminitis, normocytic anemia, and possible pneumonia. The plan includes weaning off IABP and pressors, managing her CAD, respiratory failure, transaminitis, normocytic anemia, and electrolyte imbalance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's current condition is cardiogenic shock, which can lead to further deterioration in organ perfusion and function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and difficulty weaning off the ventilator (extubation failure).
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting liver injury. This could be due to ischemic damage or other factors. Monitoring liver function and further investigation are needed.
4. Normocytic anemia: The patient has a decreased hemoglobin level, likely due to blood"

   Imaging: TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
   systolic function is depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent)
   secondary to extensive severe apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis.
   The anterior septum and anterior free wall are severely
   hypokinetic/akinetic. The rest of the left ventricle is hyperdynamic.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
   function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
   depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. However, due to extensive acoustic
   artifact from the right heart wire/catheter, the amount of tricuspid
   regurgitation may be inaccurately quantitated by color-flow imaging.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2138-6-23**], extensive left ventricular contractile
   dysfunction now present. A wire/catheter is seen crossing the tricuspid
   valve, and there is now significant tricuspid regurgitation, possibly
   related to the wire/catheter.
   Assessment and Plan
     Patient is a 49 y/o F w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest who p/w
   unrevascularized STEMI and cardiogenic shock with diffuclty weaning
   from IABP and pressors.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: [**2-8**] to large acute anterior myocardial
   infarction.  Currently on IABP with plan to wean to pull this AM
   - As IABP is not required for coronary perfusion and blood pressures
   stable on 1:4, will pull this AM
   - unlikely to require dobutamine for afterload reducing as pressures
   remained stable on 1:4
   - heparin gtt for IABP
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR
   - Check pulses frequently with IABP in place
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p STEMI acute anterior wall,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Otherwise her mid LAD is occluded and
   there is a proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size
   diagonal, that on cath film appears to supply a viable, contracting
   territory.  Her SVG to OM has in stent restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is
   patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would benefit at this time
   - No significant tight proximal lesions that would benefit from IABP,
   will dc today
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt (stopped
   at 3am in prep for IABP pulling)
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs)
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, Intubated.
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - wean sedation and attempt RISBI later today following IABP removal
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN
   # Pneumonia:. afebrile overnight, WBCs stable, CXR c/w edema. Holding
   ABX for now, will start empirically for HAP or VAP if has leukocytosis
   or CXR findings of infiltrate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She presented with an unrevascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She is currently on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and has been difficult to wean from the IABP and pressors.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock secondary to a large acute anterior myocardial infarction. She is on IABP support and plans to wean off the IABP this morning. Her blood pressures have been stable on a 1:4 ratio, so it is likely that she will not require dobutamine for afterload reduction. Heparin will be continued for IABP support.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has severe multivessel disease and recently experienced an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction, likely due to occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She also has in-stent restenosis in the SVG to the obtuse marginal (OM) branch. Her SVG to the posterior descending artery (PDA) is patent. Repeat percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unlikely to benefit her at this time. She will eventually need a"

   Assessment and Plan
     Patient is a 49 y/o F w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest who p/w
   unrevascularized STEMI and cardiogenic shock with diffuclty weaning
   from IABP and pressors.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: [**2-8**] to large acute anterior myocardial
   infarction.  Currently on IABP with plan to wean to pull this AM
   - As IABP is not required for coronary perfusion and blood pressures
   stable on 1:4, will pull this AM
   - unlikely to require dobutamine for afterload reducing as pressures
   remained stable on 1:4
   - heparin gtt for IABP being held currently for pulling IABP and will
   restart after for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR. Will need coumadin prior to d/c
   for apical AK.
   - Check pulses frequently with IABP in place but will be d/c
d today
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p STEMI acute anterior wall,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Otherwise her mid LAD is occluded and
   there is a proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size
   diagonal, that on cath film appears to supply a viable, contracting
   territory.  Her SVG to OM has in stent restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is
   patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would benefit at this time
   - No significant tight proximal lesions that would benefit from IABP,
   will dc today
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt (stopped
   at 3am in prep for IABP pulling), start captopril today and consider
   coreg later if BPs ok after captopril
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs). Will check
   hct later today to ensure stable
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, Intubated.
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - wean sedation and attempt RISBI later today following IABP removal
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN
   # Pneumonia:. afebrile overnight, WBCs stable, CXR c/w edema. Holding
   ABX for now, will start empirically for HAP or VAP if has leukocytosis
   or CXR findings of infiltrate or fevers
   #. Normocytic Anemia:.  Likely IABP related.
   - hapto wnl.
   - s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs
   - goal HCT > 30
   - D/c IABP today
   #. Access: will need to d/c OSH lines today likely will not require CVL
   following IABP removal and extubation
   #. PPx:  heparin gtt, bowel regimen prn
   #. Emergency contact:
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 81**]
   Nutrition:  Tube feeds going, will have to stop if plan to extubate

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and experienced a previous ventricular fibrillation arrest. She presented with unrevascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock, requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient has been experiencing difficulty weaning from IABP and pressors. Her echocardiogram showed extensive left ventricular contractile dysfunction with depressed ejection fraction (40-50%), severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the anterior septum and free wall, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. She also has multivessel coronary artery disease, now complicated by an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction, likely secondary to occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's current condition of cardiogenic shock may worsen if there are further complications or if the underlying cause is not appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator might be challenging due to the ongoing cardiogenic shock.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X"

   Imaging: TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
   systolic function is depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent)
   secondary to extensive severe apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis.
   The anterior septum and anterior free wall are severely
   hypokinetic/akinetic. The rest of the left ventricle is hyperdynamic.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
   function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
   depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. However, due to extensive acoustic
   artifact from the right heart wire/catheter, the amount of tricuspid
   regurgitation may be inaccurately quantitated by color-flow imaging.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2138-6-23**], extensive left ventricular contractile
   dysfunction now present. A wire/catheter is seen crossing the tricuspid
   valve, and there is now significant tricuspid regurgitation, possibly
   related to the wire/catheter.
   Assessment and Plan
     Patient is a 49 y/o F w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest who p/w
   unrevascularized STEMI and cardiogenic shock with diffuclty weaning
   from IABP and pressors.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: [**2-8**] to large acute anterior myocardial
   infarction.  Currently on IABP with plan to wean to pull this AM
   - As IABP is not required for coronary perfusion and blood pressures
   stable on 1:4, will pull this AM
   - unlikely to require dobutamine for afterload reducing as pressures
   remained stable on 1:4
   - heparin gtt for IABP being held currently for pulling IABP and will
   restart after for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR. Will need coumadin prior to d/c
   for apical AK.
   - Check pulses frequently with IABP in place but will be d/c
d today
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p STEMI acute anterior wall,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Otherwise her mid LAD is occluded and
   there is a proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size
   diagonal, that on cath film appears to supply a viable, contracting
   territory.  Her SVG to OM has in stent restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is
   patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would benefit at this time
   - No significant tight proximal lesions that would benefit from IABP,
   will dc today
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt (stopped
   at 3am in prep for IABP pulling), start captopril today and consider
   coreg later if BPs ok after captopril
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs). Will check
   hct later today to ensure stable
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, Intubated.
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - wean sedation and attempt RISBI later today following IABP removal
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN
   # Pneumonia:. afebrile overnight, WBCs stable, CXR c/w edema. Holding
   ABX for now, will start empirically for HAP or VAP if has leukocytosis
   or CXR findings of infiltrate or fevers
   #. Normocytic Anemia:.  Likely IABP related.
   - hapto wnl.
   - s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs
   - goal HCT > 30
   - D/c IABP today
   #. Access: will need to d/c OSH lines today likely will not require CVL
   following IABP removal and extubation
   #. PPx:  heparin gtt, bowel regimen prn
   #. Emergency contact:
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 81**]
   Nutrition:  Tube feeds going, will have to stop if plan to extubate

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who presented with an unrevascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She is currently intubated and on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient has severe multivessel disease, now with a STEMI due to occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). There is also in-stent restenosis in the SVG to the obtuse marginal (OM) and patent SVG to the posterior descending artery (PDA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has difficulty weaning from IABP and pressors, indicating ongoing cardiogenic shock. Weaning from IABP will be attempted this morning, and the patient may need continued afterload reduction with dobutamine.
2. Acute Anterior Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient had a large acute anterior MI, as evidenced by wall motion abnormality (WMA) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). This may lead to further compromise of cardiac function.
3. Tricuspid Regurgitation: Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen on TTE, possibly due to the presence of the right heart wire/catheter"

   #Cardiogenic Shock
 resolved, hemodynamically stable s/p extubation
   and IABP removal
   -cont captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction unlikely to
   require dobutamine for afterload reducing as pressures remained stable
   on 1:4
   - heparin gtt for IABP being held currently for pulling IABP and will
   restart after for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR. Will needcoumadin prior to d/c for
   apical AK.
   - Check pulses frequently with IABP in place but will be d/c

   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p anterior wall STEMI,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Mid LAD is occluded and there is a
   proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on
   cath film appears to supply a viable, contracting territory.  Her SVG
   to OM has in stent restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would benefit at this time
   - No significant tight proximal lesions that would benefit from IABP,
   will dc today
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt (stopped
   at 3am in prep for IABP pulling), start captopril today and consider
   coreg later if BPs ok after captopril
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs). Will check
   hct later today to ensure stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest due to an unrevascularized anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient was intubated and received intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She is currently being weaned off the IABP and extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient previously experienced cardiogenic shock, which has resolved. However, she may still require medications for afterload reduction and will need to be monitored closely for any signs of recurrent shock.
2. Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction: The patient had an anterior wall myocardial infarction, which resulted in decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (40-50%). She will require further evaluation and management of this condition.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a low-grade temperature and sputum with gram-positive cocci (GPCs), indicating a possible pneumonia. She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Normocytic Anemia: The patient has developed normocytic anemia, likely due to blood loss during the IABP placement. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and will"

   24 Hour Events:
   - IABP pulled
   - Extubated
   - Started captopril and uptitrated for afterload reduction
   - Pm Hct stable
   - PM lytes with K 3.6 so repleted then with more lasix for extubation
   had K 3.3 so received more K
   - Temp 100.1 and sputum with 3+ GPCs and strep pneumo from OSH cultures
   so started vanc/zosyn
   - Got 20mg lasix IV X1 prior to extubation for frothy secretions
   although UOP good after the first dose in the am
   - Restarted hep gtt at 4pm for apical AK on TTE (will need transition
   to coumadin prior to discharge)
   - Started coreg as HRs in 90s and BPs 150s/80s
   - Delirious overnight and suspect ICU psychosis. Zyprexa given and did
   not respond so got haldol.
   - Flashed at 2am with BPs 180s/120s, tachypnea to 30s, and HR 120s with
   tiny drop in sats responded to nitro gtt, morphine (2mg), and
   non-invasive mask ventilation. Got 40mg IV lasix with only 20ml out so
   got 80mg as CXR looked like more pulm edema (although poor film) -> put
   out 2L (from [**2-13**] AM). EKG with inferior ST depressions and little

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She experienced a previous ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest due to an unrevascularized anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient was treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and mechanical ventilation but has now been extubated and the IABP removed.

The patient's current conditions include cardiogenic shock that has resolved, normocytic anemia, transaminitis (presumably ischemic), pneumonia, and severe multivessel coronary artery disease. She also has a large anterior myocardial infarction with reduced ejection fraction (40-50%) and apical akinesia on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). There is a concern about worsening tricuspid regurgitation possibly caused by an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead.

The patient's recent events include the removal of the IABP and extubation, the administration of captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction, and the restart of heparin gtt for the IABP being held currently. She was also given zyprexa and haldol for delirium, and nitroglycerin, morphine, and non-invasive mask ventilation for a flash"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o F w/ CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest p/w unrevascularized anterior
   STEMI and cardiogenic shock s/p removal of IABP and extubation [**5-1**].
   .
   #Cardiogenic Shock
 resolved, hemodynamically stable s/p extubation
   and IABP removal
   -cont captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction (change hold
   parameters to SBP 90)
   - heparin gtt for IABP being held currently for pulling IABP and will
   restart after for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR. Will need coumadin prior to d/c
   for apical AK.
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p anterior wall STEMI,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Mid LAD is occluded and there is a
   proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on
   cath film appears to supply a viable, contracting territory.  Her SVG
   to OM has in stent restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would benefit at this time
   - No significant tight proximal lesions that would benefit from IABP,
   will dc today
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt (stopped
   at 3am in prep for IABP pulling), start captopril today and consider
   coreg later if BPs ok after captopril
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs). Will check
   hct later today to ensure stable
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, extubated.
   Flashed yesterday and responded well to lasix bolus with improvement in
   clinical parameters
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - no need for lasix currently,
   .
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN
   .
   # Pneumonia
 low grade temp O/N, sputum gram stain w/ GPC
   pairs/clusters but Cx mod growth OP flora; has been on vent for
   extended period however. Unlikely MRSA pneumonia. Not hospital
   acquired. Has defervesced and improved clinically. Currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn day #2
   -cont vanc and zosyn for now
   -f/u OSH culture data, narrow as able
   .
   #. Normocytic Anemia
 presumed [**2-8**] IABP placement, hapto wnl, s/p 2 U
   PRBC
   -maintain Hct > 30
   .
   #. Access: will need to d/c OSH lines today likely will not require CVL
   following IABP removal and extubation
   #. PPx:  heparin gtt, bowel regimen prn
   #. Emergency contact:
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest due to an unrevascularized anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
- She was treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and mechanical ventilation but is now hemodynamically stable after the removal of the IABP and extubation.
- The patient has severe multivessel coronary artery disease, with an anterior wall STEMI likely caused by occlusion of the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery.
- She also has in-stent restenosis in the saphenous vein graft to the omohyoidal artery.
- The patient's ejection fraction is depressed to 40-50% based on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) that showed wall motion abnormalities consistent with a large anterior MI.
- She has been started on captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction and will continue aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and heparin therapy.
- The patient has respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic shock, for which she was mechanically ventilated but has now been extubated.
- She is being weaned off oxygen supplementation as tolerated.
- The patient has transaminitis, which is presumed to be ischem"

   24 Hour Events:
   - IABP pulled
   - Extubated
   - Started captopril and uptitrated for afterload reduction
   - Pm Hct stable
   - PM lytes with K 3.6 so repleted then with more lasix for extubation
   had K 3.3 so received more K
   - Temp 100.1 and sputum with 3+ GPCs and strep pneumo from OSH cultures
   so started vanc/zosyn
   - Got 20mg lasix IV X1 prior to extubation for frothy secretions
   although UOP good after the first dose in the am
   - Restarted hep gtt at 4pm for apical AK on TTE (will need transition
   to coumadin prior to discharge)
   - Started coreg as HRs in 90s and BPs 150s/80s
   - Delirious overnight and suspect ICU psychosis. Zyprexa given and did
   not respond so got haldol.
   - Flashed at 2am with BPs 180s/120s, tachypnea to 30s, and HR 120s with
   tiny drop in sats responded to nitro gtt, morphine (2mg), and
   non-invasive mask ventilation. Got 40mg IV lasix with only 20ml out so
   got 80mg as CXR looked like more pulm edema (although poor film) -> put
   out 2L (from [**2-13**] AM). EKG with inferior ST depressions and little
   longer QT with continued STE V1-V3 as in prior.

   .
   #Cardiogenic Shock
 resolved, hemodynamically stable s/p extubation
   and IABP removal
   - cont captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction (change hold
   parameters to SBP 90)
   - heparin gtt for IABP being held currently for pulling IABP and will
   restart after for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and

   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p anterior wall STEMI,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Mid LAD is occluded and there is a
   proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest due to an unrevascularized anterior STEMI and cardiogenic shock. The patient was successfully resuscitated and received an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and mechanical ventilation. She has been weaned off the IABP and extubated.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient initially experienced cardiogenic shock, which has since resolved.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic shock. She was intubated and later extubated.
3. Transaminitis: The patient developed transaminitis, likely due to ischemia. Enzyme trends are being monitored, and further workup will be done as needed.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is suspected to be healthcare-associated. She is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics. The antibiotics may be discontinued soon, and she will start levofloxacin.
5. Normocytic Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, likely due to the IABP placement. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells and will maintain a hematocrit (Hct) above 30%.
6. Access: The patient will need to have her OSH lines removed and replaced with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.
7. Potential need for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): The patient's anterior wall myocardial infarction has resulted in a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 40-50%. She may require an ICD prior to discharge.
8. Coronary artery disease with severe multivessel disease: The patient has severe multivessel disease, including in-stent restenosis of a saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the omohyoid artery (OM) and occlusion of the SVG to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). There is also a proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a viable territory. Revascularization options will be considered after a viability study.
9. Acute kidney injury (AK): The patient has evidence of apical AK on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). She will need to transition to coumadin prior to discharge.
10. Potential for ICU psychosis: The patient was delirious overnight and suspected to have ICU psychosis. She was given haloperidol, which did not respond."

   .
   #Cardiogenic Shock
 resolved, hemodynamically stable s/p extubation
   and IABP removal
   - cont captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction (change hold
   parameters to SBP 90)
   - heparin gtt for IABP being held currently for pulling IABP and will
   restart after for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR. Will need coumadin prior to d/c
   for apical AK.
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p anterior wall STEMI,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Mid LAD is occluded and there is a
   proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on
   cath film appears to supply a viable, contracting territory.  Her SVG
   to OM has in stent restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would provide benefit at this time
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt (stopped

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 49 y/o F w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest who p/w
   unrevascularized STEMI and cardiogenic shock with diffuclty weaning
   from IABP and pressors.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: [**2-8**] to large acute anterior myocardial
   infarction.  Currently on IABP with plan to wean to pull this AM
   - As IABP is not required for coronary perfusion and blood pressures
   stable on 1:4, will pull this AM
   - unlikely to require dobutamine for afterload reducing as pressures
   remained stable on 1:4
   - heparin gtt for IABP being held currently for pulling IABP and will
   restart after for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR. Will needcoumadin prior to d/c for
   apical AK.
   - Check pulses frequently with IABP in place but will be d/c
d today
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p STEMI acute anterior wall,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Otherwise her mid LAD is occluded and
   there is a proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size
   diagonal, that on cath film appears to supply a viable, contracting
   territory.  Her SVG to OM has in stent restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is
   patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would benefit at this time
   - No significant tight proximal lesions that would benefit from IABP,
   will dc today
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt (stopped
   at 3am in prep for IABP pulling), start captopril today and consider
   coreg later if BPs ok after captopril
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs). Will check
   hct later today to ensure stable
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, Intubated.
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - wean sedation and attempt RISBI later today following IABP removal
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN
   # Pneumonia:. afebrile overnight, WBCs stable, CXR c/w edema. Holding
   ABX for now, will start empirically for HAP or VAP if has leukocytosis
   or CXR findings of infiltrate or fevers
   #. Normocytic Anemia:.  Likely IABP related.
   - hapto wnl.
   - s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs
   - goal HCT > 30
   - D/c IABP today
   #. Access: will need to d/c OSH lines today likely will not require CVL
   following IABP removal and extubation
   #. PPx:  heparin gtt, bowel regimen prn
   #. Emergency contact:
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 81**]
   Nutrition:  Tube feeds going, will have to stop if plan to extubate

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had a previous ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest.
- She presented with an unrevascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock, which made it difficult to wean her from intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and pressors.
- The patient's condition improved, and the plan was to pull the IABP in the morning after stabilizing her blood pressures on a 1:4 ratio.
- She has severe multivessel disease, with occlusion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to stent graft failure.
- The patient underwent an echocardiogram (TTE) that showed wall motion abnormalities consistent with a large anterior MI, hypokinesis/akinesis of the anterior septum and free wall, and a depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 40-50%.
- She also had anemia, likely related to the IABP, and was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- The patient developed respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic shock and was intubated.
- She received fentanyl/versed for sedation and will have a trial of extubation and spontaneous breathing initiative later today after IABP removal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was admitted to the ICU due to worsening symptoms of pneumonia, including shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes. On admission, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam) and IV fluids. 

During the past 24 hours, the patient received a total of 3200 cc of IV fluids, with 1600 cc given at 0200 and another 800 cc given at 2130. The patient's diet was advanced to regular, and a viability study was requested for possible graft revascularization.

Allergies include codeine, hydrocodone, and morphine. The patient has been on various medications, including heparin sodium, pantoprazole (Protonix), and furosemide (Lasix).

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F) and a heart rate of 69 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal limits, ranging from 74/60 mmHg to 98/66 mmHg. The respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1733 mL and a total output of 3848 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 2115 mL. The patient's urine output is within normal limits at 3748 mL.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count are within normal limits. Blood glucose levels are stable, ranging from 96 to 101 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver enzymes, are within normal ranges.

Physical examination findings are not mentioned in the progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is at risk for developing further infections due to immunosuppression and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Fluid overload: Despite the negative fluid balance, the patient received a significant amount of IV fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Bleeding: The patient is on heparin sodium, an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Kidney injury: The patient has received a large volume of IV fluids, which could potentially cause kidney injury if not properly monitored.
5. Graft complications: The patient's condition may require graft revascularization, which carries its own set of complications, such as graft rejection or failure.
6. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and experienced a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest due to an unrevascularized anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She was intubated and received intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support before being extubated and having the IABP removed.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: Resolved, now hemodynamically stable after extubation and IABP removal. The patient is being managed with captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction, heparin gtt for IABP being held currently, and will restart after for apical AK on TTE as a bridge to coumadin. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed wall motion abnormalities consistent with a large anterior MI, anterior septum and free wall hypokinetic/akinesis, and an ejection fraction (EF) depressed to 40-50%. There is also a question of if an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) line is causing worsening tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Coumadin will be started prior to discharge.

","The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest due to an unrevascularized anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient was successfully resuscitated and subsequently had the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removed and was extubated.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock that has resolved, hemodynamic stability post-extubation and IABP removal, normocytic anemia presumed secondary to IABP placement, and severe multivessel disease now post-anterior wall STEMI, likely secondary to occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient also has in-stent restenosis of the SVG to the omohyoid artery (OM) and a patent SVG to the posterior descending artery (PDA).

The patient's medical plan includes continuing aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75mg, atorvastatin 80mg, and starting captopril today. The viability study prior to discharge is being considered. Additionally, the patient's respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic shock has been resolved, and she is currently on supplemental oxygen as tolerated.

   CXR [**2140-5-2**]
   There is interval slight progression of the opacification of both lung
   bases that might be consistent with aspiration versus the
   underdevelopment of infectious process. Bilateral pleural effusions are
   most likely present, small-to-moderate. No evidence of overt pulmonary
   edema is seen. The patient is in mild interstitial engorgement. The
   right subclavian line tip is in mid SVC. No pneumothorax is present.
   Bilateral stents in the most likely
   subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries are present .

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o F w/ CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest p/w unrevascularized anterior
   STEMI and cardiogenic shock s/p removal of IABP and extubation [**5-1**].
   .
   #Cardiogenic Shock
 resolved, hemodynamically stable s/p extubation
   and IABP removal
   - cont captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction (change hold
   parameters to SBP 90)
   - heparin gtt for IABP being held currently for pulling IABP and will
   restart after for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin
   - TTE showed WMA consistent with large anterior MI, anterior septum and
   free wall hypokinetic/ akinetic, and EF depressed to 40-50%, question
   if ICD line is causing worsening TR. Will need coumadin prior to d/c
   for apical AK.
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p anterior wall STEMI,
   several days old, likely secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on
   OSH cath images on review.   Mid LAD is occluded and there is a
   proximal LAD stenosis that supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on
   cath film appears to supply a viable, contracting territory.  Her SVG
   to OM has in stent restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is patent.
   - Unlikely repeat PCI would provide benefit at this time
   - Will eventually need viability study prior to discharge
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt (stopped
   at 3am in prep for IABP pulling), start captopril today and consider
   coreg later if BPs ok after captopril
   - check A1c
   - transfuse to HCT>30 (s/p transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs). Will check
   hct later today to ensure stable
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Secondary to cardiogenic shock, extubated.
   Flashed yesterday and responded well to lasix bolus with improvement in
   clinical parameters
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - no need for lasix currently, monitor UOP to keep negative 1L
   .
   # Transaminitis: Presumably ischemic, trend enzymes and consider
   further w/u PRN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had an anterior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with cardiogenic shock. The patient has been in the ICU for several days, during which she experienced respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic shock, underwent extubation, and had the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removed. She also had an acute kidney injury (AKI) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), likely due to the IABP.

The patient has severe multivessel disease and underwent stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with occlusion of the mid LAD and proximal LAD stenosis. There is also restenosis of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the omohyoid artery (OM). The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and heparin.

The patient's current conditions include cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, transaminitis, pneumonia, normocytic anemia, and access issues. She is currently on antibiotics for pneumonia and has been weaned off the ventilator. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 98/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg. Her fluid balance shows an output of 3,748 mL of urine and a negative fluid balance of -2,115 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has a history of cardiogenic shock, which can lead to poor perfusion of vital organs and potential organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure secondary to cardiogenic shock and was on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of reintubation or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has evidence of AKI, possibly due to the IABP, which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed appropriately.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a risk of progression or development of antibiotic resistance if the current antibiotic regimen is not effective.

5. Normocytic Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, which can further compromise tissue oxygen delivery and increase the risk of organ dysfunction.

6. Access Issues: The patient requires PICC line placement due to access issues, which can lead to complications such as thrombophlebitis or infection.

7. Transaminitis: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and experienced a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest due to unrevascularized anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock.
- She was treated with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and extubation, and her cardiogenic shock has resolved.
- The patient has severe multivessel disease, including occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), resulting in an anterior wall STEMI. There is also in-stent restenosis in the SVG to the omohyoid artery (OM).
- The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is decreased to 40-50%, and there are concerns about worsening tricuspid regurgitation (TR) potentially caused by an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead.
- The patient has been experiencing diarrhea since yesterday after tolerating oral intake for the first time. She has no other gastrointestinal symptoms.
- Her vital signs are stable, and she is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and slightly abnormal liver function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o F w/ CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest p/w unrevascularized anterior
   STEMI and cardiogenic shock s/p removal of IABP and extubation [**5-1**].
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p anterior wall STEMI, likely
   secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on OSH cath images on
   review.   Mid LAD is occluded and there is a proximal LAD stenosis that
   supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on cath film appears to supply
   a viable, contracting territory.  Her SVG to OM has in stent
   restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is patent.
   - uncertain whether PCI would provide benefit at this time
   - will otain viability study tomorrow (unable to get thalium today)
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt
   - cont captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction (cont hold
   parameters to SBP 90)
   - heparin gtt for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin; will start
   coumadin once decision in made re: possible PCI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She experienced an anterior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. The patient was intubated and placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support but was subsequently extubated.

The patient's current condition includes severe multivessel coronary artery disease with occlusion of the saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), causing a viable contracting territory. The SVG to the omohyoid artery (OM) has in-stent restenosis, while the SVG to the posterior descending artery (PDA) is patent.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. She is awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, and person. Physical examination reveals bilateral basilar crackles without wheezing or rhonchi.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, decreased platelet count of 130 K/uL, and increased creatinine level"

   right subclavian line tip is in mid SVC. No pneumothorax is present.
   Bilateral stents in the most likely
   subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries are present .
   MICRO:
   sputum from [**2140-4-30**]
 oropharengeal flora.
   Assessment and Plan
   49 y/o F w/ CAD s/p CABG, prior VF arrest p/w unrevascularized anterior
   STEMI and cardiogenic shock s/p removal of IABP and extubation [**5-1**].
   .
   #. CAD: Severe multivessel disease, now s/p anterior wall STEMI, likely
   secondary to SSVG to LAD occlusion based on OSH cath images on
   review.   Mid LAD is occluded and there is a proximal LAD stenosis that
   supplies a moderate size diagonal, that on cath film appears to supply
   a viable, contracting territory.  Her SVG to OM has in stent
   restenosis.  Her SVG to PDA is patent.
   - uncertain whether PCI would provide benefit at this time
   - will otain viability study tomorrow (unable to get thalium today)
   - continue aspirin 325, plavix 75mg, lipitor 80, heparin gtt
   - cont captopril and carvedilol for afterload reduction (cont hold
   parameters to SBP 90)
   - heparin gtt for apical AK on TTE as bridge to coumadin; will start
   coumadin once decision in made re: possible PCI.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  resolve.  Pt satting well on room air.  Resp
   failure was secondary to cardiogenic shock, extubated. Flashed
   yesterday and responded well to lasix bolus with improvement in
   clinical parameters
   - no need for lasix currently, monitor UOP to keep negative 1L
   .
   # Pneumonia
 low grade temp O/N, sputum gram stain w/ GPC
   pairs/clusters but Cx mod growth OP flora. Unlikely MRSA pneumonia. Not
   hospital acquired. Has defervesced and improved clinically.
   - cont levofloxacin 750mg x 5 days (day [**2-11**] today)
   .
   #. Normocytic Anemia
 Hct 32 -> 37. Hct improved s/p aggressive
   diuresis over the past 2 days.  Anemia was presumed [**2-8**] IABP placement,
   hapto wnl, s/p 2 U PRBC
   -maintain Hct > 30

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and experienced an unrevascularized anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) resulting in cardiogenic shock. She was resuscitated and extubated but developed respiratory failure due to cardiogenic shock. The patient's recent events include being put on diuretics, changing antibiotics, placing two peripheral intravenous lines (PIVs), advancing her diet to regular, and requesting a viability study for potential graft revascularization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of unrevascularized anterior STEMI and previous ventricular fibrillation arrest suggest a high risk for cardiogenic shock.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has low-grade fever and gram-positive cocci on sputum gram stain, indicating a possible pneumonia. However, the culture showed moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora, suggesting it may not be hospital-acquired.
3. Aspiration: The progression of opacification in both lung bases on the chest X-ray might be consistent with aspiration versus the underdevelopment of an infectious process.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions: The chest X-ray also shows bilateral pleural effusions, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Normocytic anemia: The patient's hematocrit level has improved after aggressive diuresis, but she still has an"
