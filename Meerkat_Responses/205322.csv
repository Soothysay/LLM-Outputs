   dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is significant aortic stenosis that is
   probably severe (estimated aortic valve area ~0.8 cm2). No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
   Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion. No ventricular thrombus identified.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. The patient required non-invasive ventilation and subsequently developed acute pulmonary edema, which is most likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis and compromised cardiac function. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated biomarkers for cardiac injury, including troponin-T levels of 8.88 and 9.60, indicating ongoing myocardial damage. The ECG shows ST depression in leads V2-V6, suggesting ischemia in the inferior leads. 

An echocardiogram reveals significant systolic dysfunction with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, severe aortic stenosis, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a rise in creatinine from 1.2-1.4 to 1.6, likely secondary to acute kidney injury. 

The patient also has hyperkalemia, likely due to medication use, but currently the EKG is without evidence of peaked T waves. 

The patient's diabetes is controlled with metformin at home, and insulin is being administered as an infusion in the ICU. 

The patient's hypertension is now normotensive, likely due to mild cardiogenic shock. 

The patient has facial ecchymosis from trauma sustained during a fall, but neurological examination is intact.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension presenting with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He was started on non-invasive ventilation but it was stopped after 23 minutes. A trans-thoracic echo showed decreased ejection fraction, severe aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular hypokinetic dysfunction. The patient's blood pressure was low and he was given morphine due to chest pain relief but with concern for NTG dropping BP too much because of AS. He received IV Lasix and his potassium level improved from 6.3 to 3.6 with the help of kayexalate and insulin. The patient experienced NSVT at 15:38. The ECG showed ST depression in leads V2-V6. The patient's cardiac enzymes were drawn and CK downtrended. He was started on Lasix gtt at midnight with poor urine output. The patient's oxygen saturation was 93% on aerosol-cool and CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. His vital signs were stable except for a heart rate of 107 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 100/64 mmHg to 114/75 mmHg. The patient had facial ecchymosis, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis.

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He has elevated biomarkers, denies past cardiovascular disease, but his EKG suggests prior inferior MI. An echocardiogram shows significant systolic dysfunction. The patient underwent coronary angiography and stenting of the RCA with BMS. Biomarkers continue to trend downward.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute pulmonary edema: The patient requires oxygen support and has symptoms of shortness of breath. This could be secondary to AS and compromised cardiac function.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient has a rising creatinine level and poor urine output. This may be due to a previous procedure involving contrast dye or underlying chronic kidney disease.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia, but EKG is currently normal. Repeat electrolyte levels should be monitored.
4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing relative hypotension, which may be due to cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of respiratory status and fluid administration is necessary.
5. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes is controlled with metformin, but home medications should be held in the ICU setting.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is now normotensive, likely due to mild cardiogenic shock. Beta-blocker therapy should be continued, and ACE inhibitors should be"

   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, presenting with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement in the RCA. Biomarkers remain elevated due to kidney function. The patient also has signs of aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation, and acute pulmonary edema likely secondary to compromised cardiac function. He experienced a recent fall, which may be related to AS. The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels. He is currently euvolemic but at risk for fluid overload. Other issues include diabetes management, hypertension control, electrolyte imbalances, and pernicious anemia. The patient's neurological status is intact, and there is no evidence of trauma or broken bones.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's compromised cardiac function, including left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, depressed cardiac index, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and aortic stenosis, put him at risk for further cardiac events such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal hypoperfusion, which could lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. Respiratory complications: Acute pulmonary edema and"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly individual with a history of coronary artery disease, specifically three-vessel disease. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA), which was successful. However, attempts to cross the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were unsuccessful due to heavy calcification. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/66 to 78/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 55 mg/dL, and other lab results show elevated troponin-T levels and mild renal impairment. The patient has mild left-sided heart failure with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension. The patient's cardiac index is depressed, indicating reduced cardiac output. The patient is currently receiving ICU care and is planned for transfer to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Ischemia: Due to the presence of three-vessel coronary artery disease, there is a risk of recurrent angina or myocardial infarction.
2. Heart Failure: The elevated left ventricular filling pressures and depressed cardiac index suggest compromised cardiac function, which may lead to worsening heart failure.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension and evidence of crack"

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. The patient underwent coronary angiography which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The left main coronary artery had mild nonobstructive disease, the mid left anterior descending artery was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70% stenosis, the left circumflex artery was occluded proximally, and the right coronary artery had a 90% proximal stenosis with diffuse disease distally. The patient underwent successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS, post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally. Unsuccessful attempts were made to cross the LAD due to calcification. The patient has significant systolic dysfunction and elevated biomarkers. The patient continues to require oxygen support for shortness of breath and hypoxia, likely secondary to acute pulmonary edema due to aortic stenosis and compromised cardiac function. The patient also has acute on chronic kidney disease with worsening creatinine levels. Other medical issues include diabetes, hypertension, hyperkalemia, and potential pernicious anemia. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is transfer to the floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished elderly individual with a medical history of significant coronary artery disease. They underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) with a bare metal stent (BMS). The procedure was successful, but there were unsuccessful attempts to cross the left anterior descending artery (LAD) due to heavy calcification. The patient's vital signs show a mildly elevated heart rate, low-normal blood pressure, and oxygen saturation above 92%. Lab results indicate elevated cardiac enzymes and markers of kidney dysfunction. Imaging revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease with significant blockages in the LAD and LCx arteries. Hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left-sided filling pressures, moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension, and high systemic vascular resistance. The patient's cardiac index is depressed, indicating reduced cardiac output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): Given the significant blockages in the LAD and LCx arteries, the patient is at risk for recurrent myocardial ischemia or infarction.
2. Heart Failure: The elevated left-sided filling pressures suggest diastolic dysfunction and reduced ventricular compliance, which may lead to heart failure.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: With a depressed cardiac index, the patient is at risk for cardiogenic shock due to inadequate cardiac output.
4. Pulmonary Edema: Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension and elevated left-sided filling pressures increase the risk of developing pulmonary"

   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. He presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. The patient has resolved, but his EKG suggests prior inferior MI. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The left main coronary artery had mild nonobstructive disease, while the mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70% stenosis. The LCx was occluded proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis with diffuse disease distally. 

During the procedure, the patient experienced hypotension and received a total of 750cc IVF. He also had a narrow complex tachycardia with a rate of 168, which self-terminated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 116/66 mmHg and a heart rate of 103 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 97% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T), as well as high potassium levels (K+ 6.2 mEq/L) and slightly elevated creatinine (Cr 1.9 mg/dL). 

The patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI, three vessel coronary artery disease, left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) in the right coronary artery (RCA). 

The patient's medical history includes pernicious anemia, treated with vitamin B12 by the primary care physician (PCP), and he has a hematocrit stable since March 14th prior to PCI. The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels due to diabetes and hypertension. 

The patient's current condition shows mild hypoxia and murmurs concerning for aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation. Acute pulmonary edema is likely secondary to compromised cardiac function. The patient's recent fall may be related to AS, and the lack of effusions suggests acute evolution and NSTEMI contribution. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure in the low-normal range and sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index is depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance is high normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5), and the pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).

The patient has multiple medical issues, including diabetes, hypertension"

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

   .
   # NSTEMI: TIMI score of 5.  Patient [**Name (NI) 10793**] has resolved.  S/P cath PCI
   w/BMS.  Patient denies past CV disease, but EKG suggests prior inferior
   MI.  Biomarkers remain elevated due to kidney function.
   -Semi-urgent cardiac catheterization within 48 hours from presentation.
   -Control HTN.
   -High dose Atorvastatin.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) 1167**], [**First Name3 (LF) 68**], IV heparin (guaic stools)
   -Low dose BB
   .
   #SOB, mild hypoxia. Murmurs concerning for aortic stenosis and mitral
   regurgitation.  Acute Pul edema most likely secondary to compromised
   cardiac function.  Recent fall may be related to AS.  Lack of effusions
   suggest acute evolution and NSTEMI contribution.  Less likely PNA given
   CXray findings, physical exam, and  lack of lack of fever, cough, or
   other symptoms.  Trauma evaluation felt that contusion was unlikely and
   patient does not demonstrate severe chest wall tenderness, deformities,
   or echymoses.
   -. Avoid intravascular depletion given Cr and AS, preload dependence.
   .
   #Elevated Cr, likely [**Last Name (un) 2406**] secondary to poor perfusion.  S/P Cath and 5
   doses N-acetlycysteine, patient continues to exhibit signs of renal
   hypoperfusion with elevated Cr 1.9, dry MM, UOP 36cc/hr this AM, and
   dark urine.  JVP overestimates fluid status given MR.  IVF given slowly
   out of concern for AS.  Patient's chronic renal disease is likely due
   to diabetes and hypertension with [**Last Name (un) 4578**] function of 1.2-1.4.
   - Give 500cc bolus fluids
   - Follow Cr.
   -Hold metformin.
   -Maintain euvolemic by assessing BP, MM, and UOP while avoiding
   pulmonary edema as assessed by Pox and exam.

   # Diabetes.  Patient required 8U insulin yesterday, but was NPO
   throughout day.
   -Insulin SS
   -Hold home meds
   .
   #Hypertension.  Patient is now normotensive/ relatively hypotensive
   likely due to mild cardiogenic shock and volume depletion. Continue
   beta blocker.  Hold home Nefidipine.
   -Hold ACEi relative hypotension and compromised kidney function.  Start
   prior to DC if BP tolerable.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension presenting with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent (BMS) placement in the proximal RCA. The patient has a history of three vessel coronary artery disease, left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, depressed cardiac index, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and prior inferior MI. He also has aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation, acute pulmonary edema, recent fall, and lack of effusions. The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to diabetes and hypertension. He has hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and pernicious anemia. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 116/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula, and temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F). Fluid balance shows an intake of 2500 mL, output of 1405 mL, and a positive balance of 1095 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated troponin-T levels, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. The patient is on multiple medications including atorvastatin, beta blockers, insulin, and heparin. He is being closely monitored"

   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension presenting with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He has undergone cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 116/66 mmHg and a heart rate of 103 bpm. His oxygen saturation is 97% on a nasal cannula. He has mild hypoxia and murmurs concerning for aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. He has dark urine and a dry mouth. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI, aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation puts him at risk for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
2. Renal complications: The elevated creatinine level suggests compromised renal function, which may be exacerbated by the patient's chronic kidney disease due to diabetes and hypertension. Close monitoring of renal function and careful fluid management are essential to prevent acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's mild hypoxia and bibasilar crackles on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension presenting with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He has undergone cardiac catheterization with stenting of the RCA and has significant systolic dysfunction. The patient's biomarkers are trending downward, and he remains chest pain-free. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath and hypoxia, indicating acute pulmonary edema secondary to AS (aortic stenosis) and compromised cardiac function. This requires oxygen support and monitoring.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened from 1.2-1.4 to 1.6, indicating acute kidney injury. This could be due to factors such as dehydration, contrast-induced nephropathy, or pre-existing chronic kidney disease.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a history of hyperkalemia, which may be secondary to renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has relative hypotension but is currently stable. If symptoms worsen, cardiogenic shock could develop, requiring additional therapy including possible pressor support.
5. Trauma to Face: The patient sustained trauma to the face after a fall, but denies any loss of consciousness or altered sensorium. Neurological examination is intact, and no broken bones are visible on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. He presents with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization with stenting of the right coronary artery using a bare-metal stent (BMS). Biomarkers continue to trend downward, and he remains chest pain-free. 

The patient has shortness of breath and hypoxia, requiring oxygen support. He also has signs of acute pulmonary edema, likely secondary to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and compromised cardiac function. The patient's kidney function is compromised, as indicated by a creatinine level of 1.6. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate cardiogenic shock due to his compromised cardiac function.
2. Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's worsening creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, likely secondary to compromised kidney function.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as crackles in the lung fields, may indicate pneumonia.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility in the ICU setting."
