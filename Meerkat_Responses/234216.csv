   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Continues with low urine output throughout the day.  Did not respond to
   Lasix 20mg IV or Lasix 40mg IV.  Had a vagal event after CT dye
   administration with HR down to 40s, but quickly rebounded back to 50s
   to 60s on its own (no atropine given) and patient asymptomatic. CTA
   shows b/l pleural effusions, atelectasis.  No ischemia/thrombosis,
   preserved mesenteric flow.  Transplant recommended running patient more
   positive for now, continue bicarb for 6 hours after CT and give
   Mucomyst for 24 hours after CT.  Renal recommends following daily
   CXR/PE and diuresing with 80-100mg of IV Lasix PRN.  Patient had cough
   with ACE-inhibitor, so started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].  Plan to restart heparin drip
   if INR<2.5.

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] now with NSTEMI and
   severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Improved this AM.  No longer diffusely tender.  DDx
   includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given PVD and recent NSTEMI,
   given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta, patient likely
   sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia less likely as
   lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT abdomen), anginal
   equivalent (possible, as patient presenting in the setting of NSTEMI
   with positive CEs; however, enzymes now trending down and patient
   continues to have pain), severe constipation (possible as patient has
   history of chronic constipation, and recent hospital admission [**12-29**]
   constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy, mass, ileus (patient has
   long standing history of constipation, but less likely given normal
   colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of obstruction on stat CT abdomen),
   acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, (significant pain in RUQ,
   distended gb on CT and US, but unlikely given afebrile, normal WBC,
   LFTs and no evidence of acute disease on CT or US done at OSH). Acute
   abdomen unlikely given lack of peritoneal signs, benign CT.
   - consider acute on chronic bowel ischemia, as lactate is now rising
   - evaluation for bowel ischemia would be angiography
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace
   - F/u final read CT abdomen
   - Surgery following patient, patient w/o acute abdomen right now
   - Currently on diluadid PRN pain control, but given hypomotility
   effects, consider using fentanyl which is the least constipating [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   - Continue to trend lactate q6 for signs of ischemia
   - Consider gentle IVF to treat low grade ischemia; however, use caution
   given recent drop in EF
   - if lactate > 2.5, call surgery
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD, with stress test in [**2165**] some
   anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, with
   echo at OSH showing anteroapical akinesis, CE peaked to troponin 5.07,
   MB 40.04, presenting with NSTEMI, with newly decreased EF to 45%. Was
   given 300 mg dose of plavix on arrival
   - Nitro gtt did not help with pain
   - d/c heparin gtt today as CE trending down,
   - start plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**] as tolerated by HR
   - possible cath lab today, however patient with renal failure
   .
   # PUMP: Bedside echo from [**2167-7-22**] showing EF of 45%, decreased from 60%
   4/09,may be [**12-29**] to NSTEMI, marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR, may be [**12-29**] to history of
   diastolic dysfunction, MR. Received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal
   output.
   - lasix 80mg IV x 1 today.  Monitor UOP.
   - Patient has allergy to [**Last Name (LF) 9689**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] clarify reaction today
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN
   - Lasix 20 mg IV as pt with signs of volume overload
   - ECHO today
   .
   # RHYTHM: has history of PAF, s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long
   term coumadin, INR 1.5 on admission. On tele, patient is intermittently
   in A. fib, intermittently sinus, rate 70s-85. Patient has history of
   bradyarrhythmia, INR 5.1 on admission
   - Received vitamin K 2.5 mg SQ on admission
   - Off coumadin until INR [**12-30**]
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID, as tolerated by HR
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN, s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy, Cr 2.9 on admission, around baseline of [**12-30**]
   since [**1-3**], pending this AM
   -discontinue [**Last Name (un) **] today
   - may be getting transplant sclerosis
   - Transplant team recs today re: cath lab in light of chronic renal
   insufficiency
   - Continue immunosuppresive agents
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: ABG @ 3 am 7.24/41/55 HCO3 18
   Gap calculated to be 20 from BMP @ 9:45 pm. Mostly likely etiology is
   renal, given history of renal insufficiency. Also on the differential
   is lactic acidosis, possible given recent NSTEMI, and severe abdominal
   pain that may be [**12-29**] to ischemia. Lactate level has been wnl at 1.5,
   however. Venous BG from this AM 7.13/53/104, HCO3 19, results appear
   more consistent with ABG. Other less likely etiologies of anion gap
   metabolic acidosis include toxic ingestions, which this patient denies.
   - Repeat VBG
   - Start maintainane IVF with D5 with 3 amps HCO3
   - Continue to monitor lactate levels
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: BSGlu 155, continue
   SSI
   .
   #  Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Currently normotensive
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg po BID
   - Lasix prn
   - Hold home hydralazine, clonidine, amlodopine
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: check TSH, continue synthroid 88 mcg

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dominant cytokine renal transplant in 2160, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII)/hypertension. She presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. The patient's current condition includes low urine output, unresponsiveness to diuretics, vagal event after contrast dye administration, bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis, and preserved mesenteric flow on computed tomography angiography (CTA). Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 149/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals a moderate distress-oriented state, sclera anicteric, pink conjunctiva, no pallor or cyanosis of oral mucosa, no xanthalesma, supple neck with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 7 cm, pansystolic murmur at the left fifth intercostal space, decreased breath sounds at the right lung base, soft and diffusely tender abdomen, and no peripheral edema. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, end-stage renal disease post-dialysis catheterized renal transplant in 2016. She presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. The patient's condition has been complicated by low urine output unresponsive to Lasix, a vagal event after contrast dye administration, bilateral pleural effusions, and atelectasis on CT angiography. She also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and gout.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bowel ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain, rising lactate levels, and history of peripheral vascular disease and recent NSTEMI suggest the possibility of bowel ischemia. Further evaluation for this condition would be angiography.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's low urine output unresponsive to diuretics indicates a possible acute kidney injury. Monitoring the patient's renal function and considering interventions such as gentle intravenous fluids to treat low-grade ischemia are important.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's marked pulmonary hypertension and history of diastolic dysfunction raise concerns about pulmonary hypertension. A right heart catheterization may be necessary to evaluate this condition further.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent NSTEMI put her at risk for cardiac"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Continues with low urine output throughout the day.  Did not respond to
   Lasix 20mg IV or Lasix 40mg IV.  Had a vagal event after CT dye
   administration with HR down to 40s, but quickly rebounded back to 50s
   to 60s on its own (no atropine given) and patient asymptomatic. CTA
   shows b/l pleural effusions, atelectasis.  No ischemia/thrombosis,
   preserved mesenteric flow.  Transplant recommended running patient more
   positive for now, continue bicarb for 6 hours after CT and give
   Mucomyst for 24 hours after CT.  Renal recommends following daily
   CXR/PE and diuresing with 80-100mg of IV Lasix PRN.  Patient had cough
   with ACE-inhibitor, so started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].  Code status and ICU consent

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in [**2160**]. She presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. The patient has a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 45%, marked pulmonary hypertension, and moderate mitral regurgitation. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and bradycardia. The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely due to renal insufficiency. She has diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gout. The patient is currently NPO except for medications, and her electrolytes should be monitored. She is on immunosuppressive therapy for her renal transplant. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Pain: The patient is experiencing severe abdominal pain, which could be due to various causes such as intestinal ischemia, anginal equivalent, severe constipation, obstruction (malignancy, mass, ileus), acute cholecystitis, or acute cholangitis. Further evaluation is required to determine the exact cause.
2. Bowel Ischemia: Given the patient's history of PVD and recent NSTEMI, there is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] now with NSTEMI and
   severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: DDx includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given
   PVD and recent NSTEMI, given diffuse athermatous plaques within the
   aorta, patient likely sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric
   ischemia less likely as lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia
   on CT abdomen), anginal equivalent (possible, as patient presenting in
   the setting of NSTEMI with positive CEs; however, enzymes now trending
   down and patient continues to have pain), severe constipation (possible
   as patient has history of chronic constipation, and recent hospital
   admission [**12-29**] constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy, mass, ileus
   (patient has long standing history of constipation, but less likely
   given normal colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of obstruction on stat
   CT abdomen), acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, (significant pain
   in RUQ, distended gb on CT and US, but unlikely given afebrile, normal
   WBC, LFTs and no evidence of acute disease on CT or US done at OSH).
   Acute abdomen unlikely given lack of peritoneal signs, benign CT.
   - consider acute on chronic bowel ischemia, as lactate is now rising
   - evaluation for bowel ischemia would be angiography
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace
   - F/u final read CT abdomen
   - Surgery following patient, patient w/o acute abdomen right now
   - Currently on diluadid PRN pain control, but given hypomotility
   effects, consider using fentanyl which is the least constipating [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   - Continue to trend lactate q6 for signs of ischemia
   - Consider gentle IVF to treat low grade ischemia; however, use caution
   given recent drop in EF
   - if lactate > 2.5, call surgery
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD, with stress test in [**2165**] some
   anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, with
   echo at OSH showing anteroapical akinesis, CE peaked to troponin 5.07,
   MB 40.04, presenting with NSTEMI, with newly decreased EF to 45%. Was
   given 300 mg dose of plavix on arrival
   - Nitro gtt did not help with pain
   - d/c heparin gtt today as CE trending down,
   - start plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**] as tolerated by HR
   - possible cath lab today, however patient with renal failure
   .
   # PUMP: Bedside echo from [**2167-7-22**] showing EF of 45%, decreased from 60%
   4/09,may be [**12-29**] to NSTEMI, marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR, may be [**12-29**] to history of
   diastolic dysfunction, MR. Received 40 mg
   - Patient has allergy to [**Last Name (LF) 9689**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] clarify reaction today
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN
   - Lasix 20 mg IV as pt with signs of volume overload
   .
   # RHYTHM: has history of PAF, s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long
   term coumadin, INR 1.5 on admission. On tele, patient is intermittently
   in A. fib, intermittently sinus, rate 70s-85. Patient has history of
   bradyarrhythmia, INR 5.1 on admission
   - Received vitamin K 2.5 mg SQ on admission
   - Off coumadin until INR [**12-30**]
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID, as tolerated by HR
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN, s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy, Cr 2.9 on admission, around baseline of [**12-30**]
   since [**1-3**], pending this AM
   - may be getting transplant sclerosis
   - Transplant team recs today re: cath lab in light of chronic renal
   insufficiency
   - Continue immunosuppresive agents
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: ABG @ 3 am 7.24/41/55 HCO3 18
   Gap calculated to be 20 from BMP @ 9:45 pm. Mostly likely etiology is
   renal, given history of renal insufficiency. Also on the differential
   is lactic acidosis, possible given recent NSTEMI, and severe abdominal
   pain that may be [**12-29**] to ischemia. Lactate level has been wnl at 1.5,
   however. Venous BG from this AM 7.13/53/104, HCO3 19, results appear
   more consistent with ABG. Other less likely etiologies of anion gap
   metabolic acidosis include toxic ingestions, which this patient denies.
   - Repeat VBG
   - Start maintainane IVF with D5 with 3 amps HCO3
   - Continue to monitor lactate levels
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: BSGlu 155, continue

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and end-stage renal disease who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in 2160. She presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 149/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination revealed a moderately distressed patient with preserved consciousness. The patient's sclera were anicteric, and there were no pallor or cyanosis in the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 7 cm. Cardiac examination showed regular heart sounds with a pansystolic murmur best heard at the left fifth intercostal space. Lung examination was unremarkable except for decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness, particularly in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), without any signs of peritoneal irritation or hepatosplenomegaly. No femoral bruits were appreciated. Extremity examination was unremarkable.

Laboratory findings included hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 8.8 K/uL, platelet count of"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] now with NSTEMI and
   severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Improved this AM.  No longer diffusely tender.  DDx
   includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given PVD and recent NSTEMI,
   given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta, patient likely
   sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia less likely as
   lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT abdomen), anginal
   equivalent (possible, as patient presenting in the setting of NSTEMI
   with positive CEs; however, enzymes now trending down and patient
   continues to have pain), severe constipation (possible as patient has
   history of chronic constipation, and recent hospital admission [**12-29**]
   constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy, mass, ileus (patient has
   long standing history of constipation, but less likely given normal
   colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of obstruction on stat CT abdomen),
   acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, (significant pain in RUQ,
   distended gb on CT and US, but unlikely given afebrile, normal WBC,
   LFTs and no evidence of acute disease on CT or US done at OSH). Acute
   abdomen unlikely given lack of peritoneal signs, benign CT.
   - consider acute on chronic bowel ischemia, as lactate is now rising
   - evaluation for bowel ischemia would be angiography
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace
   - CT abdomen does not show any clear signs of mesenteric ischemia
   - Surgery following patient, patient w/o acute abdomen right now
   - Currently on diluadid PRN pain control, but given hypomotility
   effects, consider using fentanyl which is the least constipating [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   - Continue to trend lactate q6 for signs of ischemia
   - Consider gentle IVF to treat low grade ischemia; however, use caution
   given recent drop in EF (250cc bolus if needed)
   - if lactate > 2.5, call surgery
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD, with stress test in [**2165**] some
   anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, with
   echo at OSH showing anteroapical akinesis, CE peaked to troponin 5.07,
   MB 40.04, presenting with NSTEMI, with newly decreased EF to 45%. Was
   given 300 mg dose of plavix on arrival
   - Nitro gtt did not help with pain
   - no longer on heparin gtt
   - plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and pause on tele this
   AM
   .
   # PUMP: Bedside echo from [**2167-7-22**] showing EF of 45%, decreased from 60%
   4/09,may be [**12-29**] to NSTEMI, marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR, may be [**12-29**] to history of
   diastolic dysfunction, MR. Received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal
   output.  Continues to have minimal UOP.  Consider ATN as a possible
   diagnosis.
   - do not give lasix as this may be ATN
   - Patient has allergy to [**Last Name (LF) 9689**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] clarify reaction today
   - Discontinue metoprolol
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN
   - ECHO today
   ..
   # RHYTHM: has history of PAF, s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long
   term coumadin, INR 1.5 on admission. On tele, patient is intermittently
   in A. fib, intermittently sinus, rate 70s-85. Patient has history of
   bradyarrhythmia, INR 5.1 on admission
   - Received vitamin K 2.5 mg SQ on admission
   - Off coumadin until INR [**12-30**]

   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN, s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy, Cr 2.9 on admission, around baseline of [**12-30**]
   since [**1-3**].  Cr continues to trend up (4.6 today from 3.7 yesterday)
   - transplant following
   - renal u/s performed yesterday was a poor study given patient
s motion
   and difficulty cooperating
   - discontinued [**Last Name (un) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in 2160, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. The patient's symptoms include pain at the graft site, increased creatinine levels, agitation, and attempts to remove her central line.

Potential medical complications:
1. Bowel ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain, elevated lactate levels, and history of PVD and recent NSTEMI raise concerns for bowel ischemia. An angiography could be considered for further evaluation.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels, minimal urine output, and history of ESRD suggest the possibility of AKI. Monitoring fluid balance, avoiding nephrotoxic agents, and considering gentle intravenous fluids may be appropriate.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and marked pulmonary hypertension warrant further evaluation, such as a right heart catheterization.
4. Transplant rejection: The patient's pain at the graft site and increased creatinine levels may indicate transplant rejection. Immunosuppressive therapy should be continued, and renal ultrasound may be helpful.
5. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate level and"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] now with NSTEMI and
   severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Improved this AM.  No longer diffusely tender.  DDx
   includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given PVD and recent NSTEMI,
   given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta, patient likely
   sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia less likely as
   lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT abdomen), anginal
   equivalent (possible, as patient presenting in the setting of NSTEMI
   with positive CEs; however, enzymes now trending down and patient
   continues to have pain), severe constipation (possible as patient has
   history of chronic constipation, and recent hospital admission [**12-29**]
   constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy, mass, ileus (patient has
   long standing history of constipation, but less likely given normal
   colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of obstruction on stat CT abdomen),
   acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, (significant pain in RUQ,
   distended gb on CT and US, but unlikely given afebrile, normal WBC,
   LFTs and no evidence of acute disease on CT or US done at OSH). Acute
   abdomen unlikely given lack of peritoneal signs, benign CT.
   - consider acute on chronic bowel ischemia, as lactate is now rising
   - evaluation for bowel ischemia would be angiography
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace
   - CT abdomen does not show any clear signs of mesenteric ischemia
   - Surgery following patient, patient w/o acute abdomen right now
   - Currently on diluadid PRN pain control, but given hypomotility
   effects, consider using fentanyl which is the least constipating [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   - Continue to trend lactate q6 for signs of ischemia
   - Consider gentle IVF to treat low grade ischemia; however, use caution
   given recent drop in EF (250cc bolus if needed)
   - if lactate > 2.5, call surgery
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD, with stress test in [**2165**] some
   anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, with
   echo at OSH showing anteroapical akinesis, CE peaked to troponin 5.07,
   MB 40.04, presenting with NSTEMI, with newly decreased EF to 45%. Was
   given 300 mg dose of plavix on arrival
   - Nitro gtt did not help with pain
   - no longer on heparin gtt
   - plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and pause on tele this
   AM
   .
   # PUMP: Bedside echo from [**2167-7-22**] showing EF of 45%, decreased from 60%
   4/09,may be [**12-29**] to NSTEMI, marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR, may be [**12-29**] to history of
   diastolic dysfunction, MR. Received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal
   output.  Continues to have minimal UOP.  Consider ATN as a possible
   diagnosis.
   - do not give lasix as this may be ATN
   - Patient has allergy to [**Last Name (LF) 9689**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] clarify reaction today
   - Discontinue metoprolol
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN
   - ECHO today
   ..
   # RHYTHM: has history of PAF, s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long
   term coumadin, INR 1.5 on admission. On tele, patient is intermittently
   in A. fib, intermittently sinus, rate 70s-85. Patient has history of
   bradyarrhythmia, INR 5.1 on admission
   - Received vitamin K 2.5 mg SQ on admission
   - Off coumadin until INR [**12-30**]
   - D/c metoprolol
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN, s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy, Cr 2.9 on admission, around baseline of [**12-30**]
   since [**1-3**].  Cr continues to trend up (4.6 today from 3.7 yesterday)
   - transplant following
   - renal u/s performed yesterday was a poor study given patient
s motion
   and difficulty cooperating
   - discontinued [**Last Name (un) **]
   - may be getting transplant sclerosis
   - Continue immunosuppresive agents
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: ABG @ 3 am 7.24/41/55 HCO3 18
   Gap calculated to be 20 from BMP @ 9:45 pm. Mostly likely etiology is
   renal, given history of renal insufficiency. Also on the differential
   is lactic acidosis, possible given recent NSTEMI, and severe abdominal
   pain that may be [**12-29**] to ischemia. Lactate level has been wnl at 1.5,
   however. Venous BG from this AM 7.13/53/104, HCO3 19, results appear
   more consistent with ABG. Other less likely etiologies of anion gap
   metabolic acidosis include toxic ingestions, which this patient denies.
   - Repeat VBG
   - Continue to monitor lactate levels
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: BSGlu 155, continue

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a deceased donor renal transplant in [**2160**], and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII)/hypertension. The patient presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/82 mmHg to 156/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 60s.

The physical examination reveals mild distress, oriented to time, place, and person. Sclera are anicteric, pupils are equal and reactive, and conjunctiva are pink without pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck is supple with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 7 cm. The cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with S1 and S2 heart sounds, and a pansystolic murmur heard best at the left fifth intercostal space. Lung examination is unremarkable, and the abdomen is soft with diffuse tenderness, particularly in the right upper quadrant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dominant cytokine donors (DCD) renal transplant in 2160, who is now presenting with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. She has multiple medical complications including anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, GERD, gout, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intestinal ischemia: The patient's history of PVD and recent NSTEMI, along with the presence of diffuse atheromatous plaques in the aorta, raises the possibility of intestinal ischemia. This is further supported by the worsening abdominal pain and rising lactate levels. Immediate evaluation for bowel ischemia would be angiography.

2. Acute mesenteric ischemia: Although less likely given normal white blood cell count, lactate within normal limits, and absence of acute findings on computed tomography (CT) abdomen, acute mesenteric ischemia should still be considered due to the patient's risk factors and severe abdominal pain.

3. Acute cholecystitis or cholangitis: The significant pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), dist"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] now with NSTEMI and
   severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Improved this AM.  No longer diffusely tender.  DDx
   includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given PVD and recent NSTEMI,
   given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta, patient likely
   sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia less likely as
   lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT abdomen), anginal
   equivalent (possible, as patient presenting in the setting of NSTEMI
   with positive CEs; however, enzymes now trending down and patient
   continues to have pain), severe constipation (possible as patient has
   history of chronic constipation, and recent hospital admission [**12-29**]
   constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy, mass, ileus (patient has
   long standing history of constipation, but less likely given normal
   colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of obstruction on stat CT abdomen),
   acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, (significant pain in RUQ,
   distended gb on CT and US, but unlikely given afebrile, normal WBC,
   LFTs and no evidence of acute disease on CT or US done at OSH). Acute
   abdomen unlikely given lack of peritoneal signs, benign CT.
   - consider acute on chronic bowel ischemia, as lactate is now rising
   - evaluation for bowel ischemia would be angiography
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace
   - CT abdomen does not show any clear signs of mesenteric ischemia
   - Surgery following patient, patient w/o acute abdomen right now
   - Currently on diluadid PRN pain control, but given hypomotility
   effects, consider using fentanyl which is the least constipating [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   - Continue to trend lactate q6 for signs of ischemia
   - Consider gentle IVF to treat low grade ischemia; however, use caution
   given recent drop in EF (250cc bolus if needed)
   - if lactate > 2.5, call surgery
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD, with stress test in [**2165**] some
   anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, with
   echo at OSH showing anteroapical akinesis, CE peaked to troponin 5.07,
   MB 40.04, presenting with NSTEMI, with newly decreased EF to 45%. Was
   given 300 mg dose of plavix on arrival
   - Nitro gtt did not help with pain
   - no longer on heparin gtt
   - plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and pause on tele
   yesterday AM
   .
   # PUMP: Bedside echo from [**2167-7-22**] showing EF of 45%, decreased from 60%
   4/09,may be [**12-29**] to NSTEMI, marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR, may be [**12-29**] to history of
   diastolic dysfunction, MR. Received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal
   output.  Continues to have minimal UOP.  Consider ATN as a possible
   diagnosis.
   - do not give lasix as this may be ATN
   - Patient has allergy to [**Last Name (LF) 9689**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] clarify reaction today
   - Discontinue metoprolol
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN
   - Consider obtaining ECHO
   ..
   # RHYTHM: has history of PAF, s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long
   term coumadin, INR 1.5 on admission. On tele, patient is intermittently
   in A. fib, intermittently sinus, rate 70s-85. Patient has history of
   bradyarrhythmia, INR 5.1 on admission
   - Received vitamin K 2.5 mg SQ on admission
   - Off coumadin until INR [**12-30**]
   - D/c metoprolol
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN, s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy, Cr 2.9 on admission, around baseline of [**12-30**]
   since [**1-3**].  Cr continues to trend up (4.6 today from 3.7 yesterday)
   - transplant following
   - renal u/s performed was a poor study given patient
s motion and
   difficulty cooperating
   - discontinued [**Last Name (un) **]
   - may be getting transplant sclerosis
   - Continue immunosuppresive agents
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: ABG @ 3 am 7.24/41/55 HCO3 18
   Gap calculated to be 20 from BMP @ 9:45 pm. Mostly likely etiology is
   renal, given history of renal insufficiency. Also on the differential
   is lactic acidosis, possible given recent NSTEMI, and severe abdominal
   pain that may be [**12-29**] to ischemia. Lactate level has been wnl at 1.5,
   however. Venous BG from this AM 7.13/53/104, HCO3 19, results appear
   more consistent with ABG. Other less likely etiologies of anion gap
   metabolic acidosis include toxic ingestions, which this patient denies.
   - Repeat VBG
   - Continue to monitor lactate levels
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: BS Glu 155, continue
   SSI
   .
   #  Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Was normotensive yesterday, but again
   hypertensive today.  All BP meds held yesterday.
   -consider restarting metoprolol?
   - hold all BP meds right now
   - Hold home hydralazine, clonidine, amlodopine
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH wnl, continue synthroid 88 mcg
   .
   # GERD:  Protonix 40 mg po Qday

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheter removal, and a previous renal transplant. She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but she still experiences discomfort. The differential diagnosis for her abdominal pain includes intestinal ischemia, anginal equivalent, severe constipation, obstruction, acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, and acute on chronic bowel ischemia. 

The patient also has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), gout, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Her current medications include pantoprazole, lorazepam, and various others for her medical conditions.

She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions. She is receiving IV fluids and has an 18-gauge line placed. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:

   includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given PVD and recent NSTEMI,
   given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta, patient likely
   sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia less likely as
   lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT abdomen), anginal
   equivalent, severe constipation hx of chronic constipation, and recent
   hospital admission [**12-29**] constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy,
   mass, ileus (patient has long standing history of constipation, but
   less likely given normal colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of
   obstruction on stat CT abdomen), acute cholecystitis, acute
   cholangitis, (significant pain in RUQ, distended gb on CT and US, but
   unlikely given afebrile, normal WBC, LFTs and no evidence of acute
   disease on CT or US done at OSH). Acute abdomen unlikely given lack of
   peritoneal signs, benign CT
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in 2160. The patient presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. The abdominal pain has improved, but the differential diagnosis includes intestinal ischemia, anginal equivalent, severe constipation, obstruction, malignancy, ileus, acute cholecystitis, and acute cholangitis. The CT abdomen did not show any clear signs of mesenteric ischemia. 

The patient has a history of CAD, with a stress test showing anterior apical attenuation and possible peri-infarct ischemia. An echocardiogram showed anteroapical akinesis, and cardiac enzymes were elevated. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) decreased from 60% to 45%. The patient was given a 300 mg dose of Plavix upon arrival. Nitroglycerin did not help with the pain, and heparin gtt was discontinued. Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg are to be continued. Metoprolol 12.5 mg was stopped due to low heart rate.

A bedside echo from 2167-07-22 showed an EF of 45%, decreased from 60%, marked pulmonary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheter removal, and previous non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). She presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but she continues to have minimal urine output and may have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to recent contrast exposure. She also has a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% from 60% due to the recent NSTEMI. The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), failed cardioversion, and long-term warfarin use. Her INR is elevated at 5.1, so she is off warfarin and receiving vitamin K. She has ESRD secondary to diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) and hypertension (HTN), with a recent deceased donor renal transplant in 2016. Her creatinine levels are increasing, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy or rejection. The patient expresses reluctance to be on long-term dialysis. She has a history of neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy related to DMII, for which she is on insulin. Her blood pressure is well-controlled with medication"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), nausea/vomiting, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 159/55 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.1°C (96.9°F), but there is no mention of the blood glucose level.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and the cardiovascular and peripheral vascular assessments show normal findings. However, the patient has diminished pulses in both right and left distal pulses. Respiratory and chest examination shows clear breath sounds with symmetric expansion. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds and obesity. There is no evidence of lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 182 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 182 K/uL. The creatinine level has progressively increased from 2.9 mg/dL on 07/24 to 5.5 mg/dL on 07/27, indicating worsening renal function. Other laboratory values, including electrolytes, liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] now with NSTEMI and
   severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Improved this AM.  No longer diffusely tender.  DDx
   includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given PVD and recent NSTEMI,
   given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta, patient likely
   sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia less likely as
   lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT abdomen), anginal
   equivalent, severe constipation hx of chronic constipation, and recent
   hospital admission [**12-29**] constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy,
   mass, ileus (patient has long standing history of constipation, but
   less likely given normal colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of
   obstruction on stat CT abdomen), acute cholecystitis, acute
   cholangitis, (significant pain in RUQ, distended gb on CT and US, but
   unlikely given afebrile, normal WBC, LFTs and no evidence of acute
   disease on CT or US done at OSH). Acute abdomen unlikely given lack of
   peritoneal signs, benign CT
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace
   - CT abdomen does not show any clear signs of mesenteric ischemia
   - Currently on diluadid PRN for pain control
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinued metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
 consider restarting
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, Lasix
   40 x1 did not improve.
   - Patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   - Consider restarting metoprolol
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN?
   - Will hold lasix for now as cannot r/o ATN as cause of [**Last Name (un) **].
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Restart coumadin today as INR 1.9
   - Consider restarting metoprolol
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on
   admission. Increasing since admission. Renal U/S was poor study given
   pt motion. Transplant on board - decreased Tacrolimus to 0.5 [**Hospital1 **].
   Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] which removed 1L
   - transplant following, f/u recs. On Tacrolimus 0.5mg po bid.
   - For permanent dialysis catheter per IR
   - For HD today
 may need to consider CVVH in the future.
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: On detemir and
   insulin SS
   .
   #  Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Episode of hypotension during HD.
   - Restarted nitro gtt this morning
   - Would hold other antihypertensives at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis circuit rupture, and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII). She presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. Her symptoms have improved, and she is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronaries: The patient has a history of CAD, and her stress test showed some anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. She presented with NSTEMI and an elevated peak troponin level. Her ejection fraction (EF) has decreased from 60% to 30-35%. She is currently on Plavix, aspirin, and atorvastatin. Metoprolol was discontinued due to low heart rate and prior pause on tele.

2. Pump: The patient has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary hypertension (TR gradient 60-70). Her EF has decreased from 60% to 40-45% on 7/24 and 30-35% on 7/27. She likely experienced an NSTEMI. Decreased urine output (UOP), and Lasix did not improve the situation. Metoprolol was held due to cough while on ACE inhibitor in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] now with NSTEMI and
   severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Improved this AM.  No longer diffusely tender.  DDx
   includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given PVD and recent NSTEMI,
   given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta, patient likely
   sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia less likely as
   lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT abdomen), anginal
   equivalent, severe constipation hx of chronic constipation, and recent
   hospital admission [**12-29**] constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy,
   mass, ileus (patient has long standing history of constipation, but
   less likely given normal colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of
   obstruction on stat CT abdomen), acute cholecystitis, acute
   cholangitis, (significant pain in RUQ, distended gb on CT and US, but
   unlikely given afebrile, normal WBC, LFTs and no evidence of acute
   disease on CT or US done at OSH). Acute abdomen unlikely given lack of
   peritoneal signs, benign CT
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace
   - CT abdomen does not show any clear signs of mesenteric ischemia
   - Currently on diluadid PRN for pain control
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD, with stress test in [**2165**] some
   anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, with
   echo at OSH showing anteroapical akinesis, CE peaked to troponin 5.07,
   MB 40.04, presenting with NSTEMI, with newly decreased EF to 45%. Was
   given 300 mg dose of plavix on arrival.
   - Nitro gtt did not help with pain
   - no longer on heparin gtt
   - plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Bedside echo from [**2167-7-22**] showing EF of 45%, decreased from 60%
   4/09,may be [**12-29**] to NSTEMI, marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR, may be [**12-29**] to history of
   diastolic dysfunction, MR. Received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal
   output.  Continues to have minimal UOP.  Consider ATN as a possible
   diagnosis.
   - do not give lasix as this may be ATN
   - Patient has allergy to [**Last Name (LF) 9689**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] clarify reaction today
   - metoprolol stopped
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN
   - TTE to be obtained this AM.  Will f/u read.
   ..
   # RHYTHM: has history of PAF, s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long
   term coumadin, INR 1.5 on admission. On tele, patient is intermittently
   in A. fib, intermittently sinus, rate 70s-85. Patient has history of
   bradyarrhythmia, INR 5.1 on admission
   - Received vitamin K 2.5 mg SQ on admission
   - Off coumadin until INR [**12-30**]
   - D/c metoprolol
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN, s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy, Cr 2.9 on admission, around baseline of [**12-30**]
   since [**1-3**].  Cr continues to trend up (5.5 today from 4.6 yesterday),
   thought to be contrast induced nephropathy vs. rejection. Pt stating
   that she does not want to be on long term dialysis.
   - transplant following, f/u recs
   - renal u/s performed was a poor study given patient
s motion and
   difficulty cooperating
   - discontinued [**Last Name (un) **]
   - Continue immunosuppresive agents
 tac decreased today per renal recs
   - temp femoral HD line to be placed this AM
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: continue insulin SS
   .
   #  Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Was hypertensive yesterday to SBPs 160s.
   - continue amlodipine
   - Continue to hold home hydralazine, clonidine, metoprolol
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH wnl, continue synthroid 88 mcg
   .
   # GERD:  Protonix 40 mg po Qday

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheter-related bloodstream infection, and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gout, and has undergone a deceased donor renal transplant in [**2160**].

The patient presented to the hospital with severe abdominal pain, which has improved this morning. Differential diagnoses for her abdominal pain include intestinal ischemia, anginal equivalent, severe constipation, obstruction, malignancy, mass, ileus, acute cholecystitis, and acute cholangitis. However, her CT abdomen does not show any clear signs of mesenteric ischemia. She has been started on a bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, and colace. 

Regarding her coronary arteries, the patient has a history of CAD, with a stress test showing some anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. An echocardiogram at the other hospital showed anteroapical akinesis, and her creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels were elevated. She presented with NSTEMI, and her ejection fraction (EF) has decreased to 45% from 60% in 2009. She has also been experiencing marked pulmonary hypertension, and a bedside echo estimated her pulmonary artery systolic pressure to be 74, with 1+ mitral regurgitation (MR). This may be due to her history of diastolic dysfunction and MR. She received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal output, and her urine output (UOP) has been minimal as well, raising concerns of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Lasix has been discontinued, and further evaluation with a right heart catheterization and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be done. 

The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), and she has been intermittently in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, as well as sinus rhythm with a rate in the 80s. She is on long-term coumadin therapy, but her INR has been elevated on admission (5.1). Vitamin K has been given, and she will be taken off coumadin until her INR normalizes. 

Regarding her ESRD, she has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension, and she underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in [**2160**]. Her creatinine levels have been trending upward, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy or rejection. She has expressed that she does not want to be on long-term dialysis. A renal ultrasound has been performed"

   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow
   - Patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   - Consider restarting metoprolol
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN?
   - Will hold lasix for now as cannot r/o ATN as cause of [**Last Name (un) **].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in [**2160**]. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Fluid Overload: The patient is unable to lie flat without desaturating, indicating fluid overload. The plan is to remove a minimum of 1.5 liters with hemodialysis (HD) today, and if the patient cannot tolerate it, consider continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).

2. ESRD: The patient has a history of ESRD secondary to diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) and hypertension. The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr) level was 2.9 on admission, which has been increasing since then. A renal ultrasound (U/S) was performed but showed a poor study due to patient motion. The patient received a femoral line and HD on [**7-27**], which removed 1 liter of fluid. The plan is to continue with HD and may need to consider CVVH in the future.

3. Coronaries: The patient has a history of CAD. A stress test conducted in [**2165**] showed some anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. The patient presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocard"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] now with
   NSTEMI and severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: DDx includes: intestinal ischemia (possible given PVD
   and recent NSTEMI, given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta,
   patient likely sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia
   less likely as lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT
   abdomen), anginal equivalent (possible as patient presenting in the
   setting of NSTEMI with positive CEs; however, enzymes now trending down
   and patient continues to have pain), severe constipation (possible as
   patient has history of chronic constipation, and recent hospital
   admission [**12-29**] constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy/mass
   (patient has long standing history of constipation, but less likely
   given normal colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of obstruction on stat
   CT abdomen), ileus, acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis,
   (significant pain in RUQ, distended gb on CT and US, but unlikely given
   afebrile, normal WBC, LFTs and no evidence of acute disease on CT or US
   done at OSH). Acute abdomen unlikely given lack of peritoneal signs,
   benign CT.
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace,
   simethicone
   - Consider d/c po iron.
   - Surgery following patient, patient w/o acute abdomen, likely will not
   need surgical intervention
   - Currently on diluadid and morphine PRN for pain, but given
   hypomotility effects could consider using fentanyl which is the least
   constipating [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   - Continue to trend lactate q6 for signs of ischemia?
   - Consider gentle IVF to treat low grade ischemia; however, use caution
   given recent drop in EF.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue Atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Consider restarting Metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**] and motitor for pauses.
   - possible cath lab? (f/u with renal re: [**Last Name (un) **])
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI.
   - Patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN?
   - Lasix prn, while maintaining end-organ perfusion
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Decrease home dose of coumadin 3 mg once when INR becomes therapeutic
   to maintain INR 2.0-3.0
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on
   admission. Increasing since admission. Transplant on board - possible
   acute rejection given subtherapeutic tacrolimus levels. Received
   femoral line and HD on [**7-27**].
   - f/u transplant recs re possibility of cath and immunosuppressive
   therapy
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: ABG [**7-24**] 7.24/41/55 HCO3 18
   AG 20. Mostly likely etiology uremia vs. lactic acidosis (less likely
   with normal serum lactate on admission). Other less likely etiologies
   of anion gap metabolic acidosis include toxic ingestions, which this
   patient denies.
   - Start maintainane IVF with D5 with 3 amps HCO3?
   - Continue to monitor lactate levels
   .
   # DMII c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: on Detemir and SSI.
   - Increase Detemir for target glucose range 80-110
   .
   # Hypertension: SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on nitro gtt now s/p
   gtt. Currently normotensive.
   - Lasix prn
   - Hold home hydralazine, clonidine, amlodopine

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] now with NSTEMI and
   severe abdominal pain.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Improved this AM.  No longer diffusely tender.  DDx
   includes: intestinal ischemia, (possible given PVD and recent NSTEMI,
   given diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta, patient likely
   sensitive to low flow state, acute mesenteric ischemia less likely as
   lactate wnl and no findings c/w acute ischemia on CT abdomen), anginal
   equivalent, severe constipation hx of chronic constipation, and recent
   hospital admission [**12-29**] constipation), obstruction [**12-29**] to malignancy,
   mass, ileus (patient has long standing history of constipation, but
   less likely given normal colonoscopy in [**3-5**] and no evidence of
   obstruction on stat CT abdomen), acute cholecystitis, acute
   cholangitis, (significant pain in RUQ, distended gb on CT and US, but
   unlikely given afebrile, normal WBC, LFTs and no evidence of acute
   disease on CT or US done at OSH). Acute abdomen unlikely given lack of
   peritoneal signs, benign CT
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace
   - CT abdomen does not show any clear signs of mesenteric ischemia
   - Currently on diluadid PRN for pain control
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD, with stress test in [**2165**] some
   anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, with
   echo at OSH showing anteroapical akinesis, CE peaked to troponin 5.07,
   MB 40.04, presenting with NSTEMI, with newly decreased EF to 45%. Was
   given 300 mg dose of plavix on arrival.
   - Nitro gtt did not help with pain
   - no longer on heparin gtt
   - plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Bedside echo from [**2167-7-22**] showing EF of 45%, decreased from 60%
   4/09,may be [**12-29**] to NSTEMI, marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR, may be [**12-29**] to history of
   diastolic dysfunction, MR. Received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal
   output.  Continues to have minimal UOP.  Consider ATN as a possible
   diagnosis.
   - do not give lasix as this may be ATN
   - Patient has allergy to [**Last Name (LF) 9689**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] clarify reaction today
   - metoprolol stopped
   - Consider right heart cath to eval pulmonary HTN
   - TTE to be obtained this AM.  Will f/u read.
   ..
   # RHYTHM: has history of PAF, s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long
   term coumadin, INR 1.5 on admission. On tele, patient is intermittently
   in A. fib, intermittently sinus, rate 70s-85. Patient has history of
   bradyarrhythmia, INR 5.1 on admission
   - Received vitamin K 2.5 mg SQ on admission
   - Off coumadin until INR [**12-30**]
   - D/c metoprolol
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN, s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy, Cr 2.9 on admission, around baseline of [**12-30**]
   since [**1-3**].  Cr continues to trend up (5.5 today from 4.6 yesterday),
   thought to be contrast induced nephropathy vs. rejection. Pt stating
   that she does not want to be on long term dialysis.
   - transplant following, f/u recs
   - renal u/s performed was a poor study given patient
s motion and
   difficulty cooperating
   - discontinued [**Last Name (un) **]
   - Continue immunosuppresive agents
 tac decreased today per renal recs
   - temp femoral HD line to be placed this AM
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: continue insulin SS
   .
   #  Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Was hypertensive yesterday to SBPs 160s.
   - continue amlodipine
   - Continue to hold home hydralazine, clonidine, metoprolol

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension, who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in [**2160**]. The patient presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. 

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Abdominal Pain: Improved this AM. No longer diffusely tender. Differential diagnosis includes intestinal ischemia, anginal equivalent, severe constipation, obstruction, malignancy, mass, ileus, acute cholecystitis, and acute cholangitis. The CT abdomen does not show any clear signs of mesenteric ischemia. The patient is being given bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, and colace.
2. CORONARIES: The patient has a history of CAD with stress test showing some anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, and an echo at OSH showing anteroapical akinesis. The patient presented with NSTEMI and has a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. The patient was given 300 mg dose of Plavix on arrival, and other medications include ASA 325, atorvastatin 80 mg, and discontinuation of metoprolol 12.5mg.
3. PUMP: The bedside echo showed EF of 45%, decreased from 60% in 4/09, and marked pulmonary hypertension with estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 74. There is also 1+ mitral regurgitation (MR), which may be related to history of diastolic dysfunction, MR. The patient received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal output and continues to have minimal urine output (UOP). Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is considered as a possible diagnosis. Lasix should not be given, and a right heart catheterization is being considered to evaluate pulmonary hypertension. A transthoracic echo (TTE) will be obtained this AM.
4. RHYTHM: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), with failed cardioversion x 2, on long-term coumadin, INR 1.5 on admission. The patient is intermittently in atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm, rate 70s-85. The patient also has a history of bradyarrhythmia, INR 5.1 on admission. Vitamin K 2.5 mg SQ was given on admission, and the patient is off coumadin until INR [**12-30**]. Metoprolol was discontinued, and the patient is being monitored on telemetry.
5. ESRD: The patient had a renal transplant in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in 2160. She presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for various complications related to her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and presented with NSTEMI. She may be at risk for further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial ischemia.

2. Renal Complications: The patient has ESRD and is on immunosuppressive therapy post-renal transplant. She is experiencing increasing creatinine levels, indicating possible renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury (AKI). This could lead to further deterioration of renal function or the need for additional dialysis.

3. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has marked pulmonary hypertension (TR gradient 60-70) and a decreased ejection fraction (EF) from 60% to 30-35%. She may be at risk for pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, or other"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension, who presented to the emergency department with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and severe abdominal pain. She has undergone an abdominal pain procedure and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid Overload: The patient has a history of CAD, diastolic heart failure, and ESRD, which puts her at risk for fluid overload. Her current fluid balance shows a negative balance of -863 mL, indicating that more fluid is being removed than infused. However, the patient's poor exam and inability to lie flat without desatting suggest ongoing fluid overload. Further monitoring and management are needed to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of ESRD and a recent increase in creatinine levels from 2.9 to 5.5. This indicates potential AKI, which can be caused by various factors including hypotension during hemodialysis, medications, or underlying conditions. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications and fluid management are essential to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a deceased donor renal transplant in 2160. She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient's ejection fraction (EF) decreased from 60% to 40-45% on 7-24 and further decreased to 30-35% on 7-27. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and has been intermittently in AFib with rates in the 70s-85 range. Her blood pressure has been elevated in the 160s but normalized with nitro gtt. She experienced an episode of hypotension during HD. The patient's abdominal pain has improved, and her Hct has decreased from 34.3 to 26.8%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload: The patient's inability to lie flat without desaturating indicates fluid overload, which can be confirmed by a poor CXR showing edema. The plan is to remove a minimum of 1.5 L with HD today, and if the patient cannot tolerate it, they may consider continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

2. ESRD: The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient has a history of obesity, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He is currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 132/49 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving nitroglycerin and heparin infusions, as well as various medications such as famotidine, Tylenol, and Pepcid. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium, while other parameters like hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count are within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals trace edema in both lower extremities, clear breath sounds with rare wheezes in the left axillae, and soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. The patient's neurological assessment is not assessed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient already has end-stage renal disease, and there is a concern for further deterioration of renal function due to the elevated levels of creatinine and BUN.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, which may indicate potential hypotension.

   66F with CAD, diastolic HF, afib on warfarin, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in
   [**2160**] presented from OSH with NSTEMI now with worsening renal failure
   requiring HD.
   .
   #Fluid overload: [**12-29**] CHF. Patient unable to lie flat without
   desaturating.
   -start nebs
   -trial of lasix 125 mg IV this AM
 if patient responds will defer HD
   today.
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on
   admission. Increasing since admission. Renal U/S was poor study given
   pt motion. Transplant on board - decreased Tacrolimus to 0.5 [**Hospital1 **].
   Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and have removed 3L total.
   - transplant following, f/u recs. On Tacrolimus 0.5mg po bid.
   - Plan for HD today if patient unresponsive to lasix
 may need to
   consider CVVH in the future.
   - f/u tac level
   - F/U renal recs regarding plan for long term HD
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinued metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure
   - no ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   - Lasix trial this am.
   - metoprolol stopped
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Coumadin stopped, heparin ggt started for better monitoring, and
   because patient may need further HD related procedures
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: Controlled on detemir
   and insulin SS
   .
   #  Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Episode of hypotension during HD.
   - Restarted nitro gtt [**7-28**], will attempt to wean today.
   - On Amlodipine 5 po qd
   - Would hold other antihypertensives at this time.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Resolved, no longer diffusely tender. CT abdomen did
   not show any signs of mesenteric ischemia. Likely [**12-29**] embolism from
   coronary event vs constipation.
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace,
   psyllium
   - Currently on diluadid and morphine PRN for pain control
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH wnl, continue synthroid 88 mcg
   .
   # GERD:  Famotidine 20mg po Qday
   .
   # Gout: hold colchicine
   .
   FEN: NPO except for meds, monitor electrolytes.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation (afib), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheterized renal transplant.
- She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).
- The patient has fluid overload, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), as she is unable to lie flat without desaturating. Nebulizers and a trial of Lasix have been started.
- Her baseline creatinine (Cr) level is 2.9, which has been increasing since admission. A renal ultrasound was performed but was a poor study due to patient motion.
- The patient's transplanted kidney is functioning poorly, with decreased tacrolimus levels and an increase in creatinine. She has been on HD and has removed a total of 3 liters so far.
- The patient has a history of CAD with a stress test showing some anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. She presented with NSTEMI and had an elevated peak troponin T level of 5.07 ng/mL. Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has decreased from"

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and end-stage renal disease post-dialysis catheterized renal transplant in [**2160**]. She presented from OSH with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).

She has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her current medications include detemir and insulin SS for diabetes, amlodipine for hypertension, atorvastatin 80 mg for hyperlipidemia, Plavix 75 mg for antiplatelet therapy, and famotidine for GERD.

Her physical examination reveals wheezing on auscultation of the chest, diminished pulses in both lower extremities, and ecchymoses on her skin. Her laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium, as well as low levels of hemoglobin and platelets.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/41 mmHg to 157/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal"

   66F with CAD, PVD, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in [**2160**] p/w with NSTEMI and
   worsening renal failure requiring HD.
   .
   #Fluid overload: CXR today is a poor study, shows edema but not
   significantly changed from prior imaging.  Patient unable to lie flat
   without desaturating.
   -plan to remove minimum 1.5 L with HD today; if patient unable to
   tolerate will consider CVVH
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on
   admission. Increasing since admission. Renal U/S was poor study given
   pt motion. Transplant on board - decreased Tacrolimus to 0.5 [**Hospital1 **].
   Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and removed 1L
   - transplant following, f/u recs. On Tacrolimus 0.5mg po bid.
   - For permanent dialysis catheter per IR
   - For HD today
 may need to consider CVVH in the future.
   - f/u tac level
   - F/U renal recs regarding plan for long term HD
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinued metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure
   - no ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   -  Will hold lasix for now as cannot r/o ATN as cause of [**Last Name (un) **].
   - metoprolol stopped
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Coumadin stopped, heparin ggt started for better monitoring, and
   because patient may need further HD related procedures
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: On detemir and
   insulin SS
   .
   #  Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Episode of hypotension during HD.
   - Restarted nitro gtt this morning, will attempt to wean today
   - Would hold other antihypertensives at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dominant cytokine renal transplant in [**2160**], diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), hypertension, and other comorbidities.

The patient presented to the hospital with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). She was found to have fluid overload, as evidenced by a poor chest X-ray showing edema but not significantly changed from prior imaging. The patient was unable to lie flat without desaturating, so it was planned to remove a minimum of 1.5 liters with HD today, with consideration of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) if the patient cannot tolerate HD.

The patient has a history of CAD, with a stress test showing some anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. She presented with NSTEMI and had an elevated cardiac troponin T level of 5.07 ng/mL. Her ejection fraction (EF) decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and further decreased to 30-35% on [**7-27**]. Plavix 300 mg was given"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, diastolic HF, afib on warfarin, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in
   [**2160**] presented from OSH with NSTEMI now with worsening renal failure
   requiring HD.
   .
   #Fluid overload: [**12-29**] CHF. Patient unable to lie flat without
   desaturating.
   -start nebs
   -trial of lasix 125 mg IV this AM
 if patient responds will defer HD
   today.
   .
   # ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD renal transplant in [**2160**], on
   immunosuppresion therapy. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on
   admission. Increasing since admission. Renal U/S was poor study given
   pt motion. Transplant on board - decreased Tacrolimus to 0.5 [**Hospital1 **].
   Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and have removed 3L total.
   - transplant following, f/u recs. On Tacrolimus 0.5mg po bid.
   - Plan for HD today if patient unresponsive to lasix
 may need to
   consider CVVH in the future.
   - f/u tac level
   - F/U renal recs regarding plan for long term HD
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinued metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure
   - Lasix trial this am.
   - Wean nitro gtt to off
   - metoprolol stopped
   - no ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Coumadin stopped, heparin ggt started for better monitoring, and
   because patient may need further HD related procedures
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: Controlled on detemir
   and insulin SS
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Episode of hypotension during HD.
   - Restarted nitro gtt [**7-28**], will attempt to wean today.
   - On Amlodipine 5 po qd
   - Would hold other antihypertensives at this time.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Resolved, no longer diffusely tender. CT abdomen did
   not show any signs of mesenteric ischemia. Likely [**12-29**] embolism from
   coronary event vs constipation.
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace,
   psyllium
   - Currently on diluadid and morphine PRN for pain control
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH wnl, continue synthroid 88 mcg
   .
   # GERD:  Famotidine 20mg po Qday

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation (afib) on warfarin, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheterized renal transplant in [**2160**], and type II diabetes mellitus (DMII) with hypertension. The patient presented from OSH with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory status has improved, with stable oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100% on nasal cannula.
- Hematocrit (Hct) levels have decreased from 34.3 to 26.8.
- The patient is hemodynamically stable.
- Guaiac test is negative, and liver function tests are normal.
- The patient had ultrafiltrate (UF) removed 2L.
- There was an episode of desaturation last night, which improved with the use of a face mask.
- The patient was weaned to 6L nasal cannula (NC).
- Lasix 125 IV was started this morning for renal purposes.
- If the patient responds, HD may be deferred today.
- NTG drip continues.

   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On plavix 75 mg
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue atorvastatin 80 mg
   - discontinued metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele

   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure
   - Lasix trial this am.
   - Wean nitro gtt to off
   - metoprolol stopped
   - no ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation (afib), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheter removal. She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient also has diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gout, and abdominal pain resolved. She is currently on various medications including nitroglycerin, heparin, famotidine, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload as indicated by her weight gain and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) such as difficulty lying flat without desaturating. This can lead to pulmonary edema and further respiratory compromise.
2. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as evidenced by increasing creatinine levels and the need for HD. This can result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid retention, and accumulation of waste products in the body.
3. Cardiovascular Events: Given the patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI, there is a risk of future cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
4. Infection: Patients in the ICU are at increased risk of developing infections,"

   requiring HD.
   .
   #Fluid overload: [**12-29**] CHF. Requiring less O2.  Trial of Lasix 120 [**7-29**] AM
   with UOP increased to 539 over the day. HD has removed 5.5L over past 4
   days.
   - Will get Lasix 120 IV bid today and hold HD. If pt continues to
   respond will not need further HD.
   - On Duonebs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD transplant
   in [**2160**]. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on admission.
   Increasing since admission. Likely [**12-29**] cardiorenal vs contrast induced
   nephropathy. Transplant on board - on Cellcept, Prednisone, Prograf.
   Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and has gotten HD x3.
   - Renal transplant following. Continue anti-rejection meds.
   - Will hold off HD today as well as IR tunneled line placement. Will
   reassess on Friday after Lasix trial.
   - Would pull femoral line today given risk of infxn.

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation (afib) on warfarin, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheter removal (DCD) renal transplant in [**2160**], and diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) with hypertension (HTN). She presented from OSH with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).

The patient has been on various medications including warfarin, Plavix, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, heparin, Cellcept, prednisone, and Prograf. She also received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and has gotten HD x3. The renal transplant was followed by anti-rejection medications.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Fluid overload: The patient had congestive heart failure (CHF) with fluid overload, as indicated by a baseline creatinine (Cr) level of 2.9 on admission and increasing levels since admission. This is likely cardiorenal vs contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient's Cr level was 5.1 on admission.

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, diastolic HF, afib on warfarin, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in
   [**2160**] presented from OSH with NSTEMI now with worsening renal failure
   requiring HD.
   .
   #Fluid overload: [**12-29**] CHF. Requiring less O2.  Trial of Lasix 120 [**7-29**] AM
   with UOP increased to 539 over the day. HD has removed 5.5L over past 4
   days.
   - Will get Lasix 120 IV bid today and hold HD. If pt continues to
   respond will not need further HD.
   - On Duonebs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD transplant
   in [**2160**]. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on admission.
   Increasing since admission. Likely [**12-29**] cardiorenal vs contrast induced
   nephropathy. Transplant on board - on Cellcept, Prednisone, Prograf.
   Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and has gotten HD x3.
   - Renal transplant following. Continue anti-rejection meds.
   - Will hold off HD today as well as IR tunneled line placement. Will
   reassess on Friday after Lasix trial.
   - Would pull femoral line today given risk of infxn.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On Plavix 75 mg
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Discontinued Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure.
   - Metoprolol stopped
   - No ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   and now in [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Would not start Spironolactone given K sparing effects in light of
   [**Last Name (un) **].
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Coumadin stopped, heparin ggt started for better monitoring, and
   because patient may need further HD related procedures.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: On NPH 18u qhs and
   insulin SS. NPH dose was missed last night. Given
 dose this morning
   and will give full dose if pt is not going to IR. On Levemir 25-30u qhs
   at home
 would transition back tonight.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission. BP labile in
   CCU. On and off nitro gtt.  Home meds Amlodipine, Clonidine,
   Hydralazine, Furosemide.
   - On Amlodipine 5 po qd and Lasix.
   - Could readd Hydralazine today.
   .
   # Anemia: On oral iron. H/H recovering after 2-3u dropped after fem
   line placement and nitro gtt. Baseline [**9-25**].
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Resolved, no longer diffusely tender. CT abdomen did
   not show any signs of mesenteric ischemia. Likely [**12-29**] embolism from
   coronary event vs constipation.
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace,
   psyllium.
   - Currently on diluadid and morphine PRN for pain control.
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires hemodialysis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110-163/45-88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 82.8 kg, with a decrease from the admission weight of 84 kg.

The patient has been receiving Lasix 120 IV every 12 hours and has had 2.5 liters of fluid removed since the start of hemodialysis. The plan for today is to continue Lasix 120 IV every 12 hours and hold hemodialysis. The need for hemodialysis will be re-evaluated on Friday. If continued hemodialysis is needed, an inferior vena cava (IVC) line will be placed. The patient has also been started on duonebs and NPH has not been given last night due to high blood sugars in the 200s. Nine units of insulin have been given this morning for possible non-operative surgery.

The patient has several known drug allergies, including codeine, nausea/vomiting, Phenergan (oral), Tylenol (oral), qu"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He is in the ICU and has been receiving Lasix IV and hemodialysis (HD) for renal failure. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 151/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has diminished peripheral pulses in both lower extremities and crackles on lung auscultation. His weight is 82.8 kg, and he has a history of obesity. 

The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels at 201 K/uL, low sodium levels at 139 mEq/L, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 101 to 159 mg/dL, elevated creatinine levels from 3.4 to 5.1 mg/dL, and elevated BUN levels from 26.8 to 34.3 g/dL. His white blood cell count is within normal range, but his platelet count is slightly elevated. His liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are significantly elevated, while his calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range. 

The patient's medical history includes renal failure, nausea/vomiting, impaired skin integrity, and cardiomyopathy. He has been receiving various medications, including furosemide (Lasix), insulin, NPH, and duonebs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications may include worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection), pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and medication side effects."

   66F with CAD, diastolic HF, afib on warfarin, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in
   [**2160**] presented from OSH with NSTEMI now with worsening renal failure
   requiring HD.
   .
   #Fluid overload: [**12-29**] CHF. Requiring less O2.  Trial of Lasix 120 [**7-29**] AM
   with UOP increased to 539 over the day. HD has removed 5.5L over past 4
   days.
   - Will get Lasix 120 IV bid today and hold HD. If pt continues to
   respond will not need further HD.
   - On Duonebs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD transplant
   in [**2160**]. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on admission.
   Increasing since admission. Likely [**12-29**] cardiorenal vs contrast induced
   nephropathy. Transplant on board - on Cellcept, Prednisone, Prograf.
   Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and has gotten HD x3.
   - Renal transplant following. Continue anti-rejection meds.
   - Will hold off HD today as well as IR tunneled line placement. Will
   reassess on Friday after Lasix trial.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On Plavix 75 mg
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Discontinued Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure.
   - Metoprolol stopped
   - No ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   and now in [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Would not start Spironolactone given K sparing effects in light of
   [**Last Name (un) **].
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Coumadin stopped, heparin ggt started for better monitoring, and
   because patient may need further HD related procedures.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: Controlled on NPH and
   insulin SS. NPH dose was missed last night. Given
 dose this morning
   and will give full dose if pt is not going to IR.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission, normalized on
   nitro gtt, gtt d/c'd. Episode of hypotension during HD.
   - On Amlodipine 5 po qd
   - Would hold other antihypertensives at this time.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Resolved, no longer diffusely tender. CT abdomen did
   not show any signs of mesenteric ischemia. Likely [**12-29**] embolism from
   coronary event vs constipation.
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace,
   psyllium.
   - Currently on diluadid and morphine PRN for pain control.
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH wnl, continue Levothyroxine 88 mcg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheter removal (DCD) renal transplant in [year]. She presented from the operating room with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). 

The patient's current condition includes fluid overload with congestive heart failure (CHF), acute-on-chronic renal failure, and ongoing management of her CAD, diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), hypertension, hypothyroidism, GERD, gout, and hypothyroidism. She also has a history of pulmonary embolism and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fluid overload: The patient will receive Lasix 120 IV twice daily to manage fluid overload and reduce the need for further HD.
2. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function will be monitored, and anti-rejection medications will be continued.
3. Coronaries: The patient will continue on Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, Atorvastatin 80 mg, and discontinuation of metoprolol due to low heart rate and prior pause.
4. Pump dysfunction: Diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary hypertension is observed. The"

   66F with CAD, diastolic HF, afib on warfarin, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in
   [**2160**] presented from OSH with NSTEMI now with worsening renal failure
   requiring HD.
   .
   #Fluid overload: [**12-29**] CHF. Requiring less O2.  Trial of Lasix 120 [**7-29**] AM
   with UOP increased to 539 over the day. HD has removed 5.5L over past 4
   days.
   - Will get Lasix 120 IV bid today and hold HD. If pt continues to
   respond will not need further HD.
   - On Duonebs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD transplant
   in [**2160**]. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on admission.
   Increasing since admission. Likely [**12-29**] cardiorenal vs contrast induced
   nephropathy. Transplant on board - on Cellcept, Prednisone, Prograf.
   Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and has gotten HD x3.
   - Renal transplant following. Continue anti-rejection meds.
   - Will hold off HD today as well as IR tunneled line placement. Will
   reassess on Friday after Lasix trial.
   - Would pull femoral line today given risk of infxn.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On Plavix 75 mg
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Discontinued Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure.
   - Metoprolol stopped
   - No ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   and now in [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Would not start Spironolactone given K sparing effects in light of
   [**Last Name (un) **].
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Coumadin stopped, heparin ggt started for better monitoring, and
   because patient may need further HD related procedures.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: On NPH 18u qhs and
   insulin SS. NPH dose was missed last night. Given
 dose this morning
   and will give full dose if pt is not going to IR. On Levemir 25-30u qhs
   at home
 would transition back tonight.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission. BP labile in
   CCU. On and off nitro gtt.  Home meds Amlodipine, Clonidine,
   Hydralazine, Furosemide.
   - On Amlodipine 5 po qd and Lasix.
   - Could readd Hydralazine today.
   .
   # Anemia: On oral iron. H/H recovering after 2-3u dropped after fem
   line placement and nitro gtt. Baseline [**9-25**].
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Resolved, no longer diffusely tender. CT abdomen did
   not show any signs of mesenteric ischemia. Likely [**12-29**] embolism from
   coronary event vs constipation.
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace,
   psyllium.
   - Currently on diluadid and morphine PRN for pain control.
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH wnl, continue Levothyroxine 88 mcg.

   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). 

The patient's current condition includes fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. She has been receiving Lasix 120 IV twice daily and her HD has removed a total of 2.5 liters over the past four days. The plan is to continue with Lasix and hold off on HD for now. 

The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is currently being treated with multiple medications for these conditions, including NPH and insulin for diabetes, amlodipine and Lasix for hypertension, and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. 

Other issues noted in the progress note include coronary artery disease with a stress test showing anteroapical attenuation and possible peri-infarct ischemia, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline 60% to 40-45% on 07/24 and 30-35% on 07/27, pulmonary hypertension with a transvalvular gradient of 60-70, and a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a pause of 6"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and end-stage renal disease post-dialysis catheter removal renal transplant in [**2160**]. She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease and experienced worsening renal failure. Her baseline creatinine was 2.9 on admission, which improved with successive HD sessions and is now stable at 4.1. The etiology of her renal failure is likely cardiorenal versus contrast-induced nephropathy. She is on immunosuppressive medications for her renal transplant.

2. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD with a stress test showing some anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. She presented with NSTEMI and had an echo showing anteroapical akinesis. Her ejection fraction decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**] from a baseline of 60% on [**3-5**]. She is on Plavix 75 mg, ASA 325 mg, and Atorvastatin 80 mg. Metoprolol was stopped due to low heart rate and prior pause.

3. Pump dysfunction: The patient has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary hypertension (TR gradient 60-70). Her ejection fraction decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]. She is being monitored for any further changes in pump function.

4. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and failed cardioversion twice. She is on long-term coumadin and has an INR of 5.1 on admission. She is intermittently in a-fib with a rate in the 70s-85 range. She had pauses of 6 seconds on [**7-26**] and 3 seconds on [**7-26**]. Metoprolol was discontinued. She is now on heparin gtt for better monitoring and because she may need further HD-related procedures.

5. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has DMII with complications of neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. She is on NPH insulin 18u qhs and insulin SS. NPH dose was missed last night. Given the dose this morning and will give a full dose if the patient is not going to IR. She will transition back to Levemir 25"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, diastolic HF, afib on warfarin, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in
   [**2160**] presented from OSH with NSTEMI now with worsening renal failure
   requiring HD.
   .
   #Fluid overload: [**12-29**] CHF. Requiring less O2.  Trial of Lasix 120 [**7-29**]
   and [**7-30**] AM with UOP >1500 over past 24 hours. HD has removed 5.5L over
   past 4 days.  No HD yesterday.
   - Renal service to eval this morning, possible HD today for
   hypervolemia, which is continuing to improve with aggressive diuresis
   - On Duonebs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD transplant
   in [**2160**]. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on admission.
   Increasing since admission, improved with successive HD sessions, now
   stable at 4.1, pt tolerating lasix. Etiology likely [**12-29**] cardiorenal vs
   contrast induced nephropathy. Transplant on board - on Cellcept,
   Prednisone, Prograf. Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and has
   gotten HD x3.
   - Renal transplant following. Continue anti-rejection meds, increased
   tacro yesterday.
   - possible HD today.  defer IR tunneled line placement until next week
   if necessary.
   - possible femoral line this AM, later if HD today, given risk of
   infxn.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On Plavix 75 mg
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Discontinued Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Initial decreased UOP,
   thought to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure.
   - Metoprolol stopped
   - No ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   and now in [**Last Name (un) **] -> will consider [**Last Name (un) **] if renal fxn improves
   - Would not start Spironolactone given K sparing effects in light of
   [**Last Name (un) **].
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Coumadin stopped, heparin ggt started for better monitoring, and
   because patient may need further HD related procedures.
   - Continue to monitor on tele -> no pause since [**7-26**], 2 sec pause noted
   then, will consider restarting metoprolol
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: On NPH 18u qhs and
   insulin SS. NPH dose was missed last night. Given
 dose this morning
   and will give full dose if pt is not going to IR. On Levemir 25-30u qhs
   at home
 would transition back tonight.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission. BP labile in
   CCU. On and off nitro gtt.  Home meds Amlodipine, Clonidine,
   Hydralazine, Furosemide.
   - On Amlodipine 5 po qd and Lasix.
   - Could read Hydralazine today.
   .
   # Anemia: On oral iron. H/H recovering after 2-3u dropped after fem
   line placement and nitro gtt. Baseline [**9-25**].
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Resolved, no longer diffusely tender. CT abdomen did
   not show any signs of mesenteric ischemia. Likely [**12-29**] embolism from
   coronary event vs constipation.
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace,
   psyllium.
   - Currently on diluadid and morphine PRN for pain control.
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH wnl, continue Levothyroxine 88 mcg.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dominant chordal renal transplant in 2160. She presented from OSH with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient has a baseline ejection fraction (EF) of 60% but decreased to 40-45% on 07/24 and 30-35% on 07/27. She also has a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DMII), hypertension (HTN), and hypothyroidism. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fluid Overload: The patient has been diagnosed with fluid overload, which is causing chronic heart failure (CHF). Aggressive diuresis has been initiated, and the patient is tolerating Lasix well. The renal service plans to evaluate the patient for possible HD today due to ongoing hypervolemia.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with an increasing baseline creatinine (Cr) since 01/03. The Cr level on admission was 2.9, which improved with successive HD sessions. The etiology of the renal failure is likely cardiorenal vs contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient"

   Increasing since admission, improved with successive HD sessions, now
   stable at 4.1, pt tolerating lasix. Etiology likely [**12-29**] cardiorenal vs
   contrast induced nephropathy. Transplant on board - on Cellcept,
   Prednisone, Prograf. Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and has
   gotten HD x3.
   - Renal transplant following. Continue anti-rejection meds, increased
   tacro yesterday.

   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.

   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure.
   - Metoprolol stopped
   - No ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   and now in [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Would not start Spironolactone given K sparing effects in light of

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation (afib) on warfarin, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheter removal (DCD) renal transplant in [**2160**]. She presented from outside hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD).

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:
1. Fluid overload: The patient has been experiencing fluid overload, as evidenced by congestive heart failure (CHF) and requiring less oxygen. Trial of Lasix 120 mg was given on [**7-29**] and [**7-30**] AM with urine output (UOP) >1500 over the past 24 hours. HD has removed 5.5 liters over the past four days. No HD yesterday.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine (Cr) of 2.9 on admission. The Cr levels have been increasing but improved with successive HD sessions, now stable at 4.1. The etiology is likely cardiorenal versus contrast-induced nephropathy.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Doctor Last Name 9827**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Resolving ATN.  Remove femoral line.  Continue medical managment of
   ACS/NSTEMI.  Hold GPI given CRI.  Continue Plavix.  Timing of
   catheterization (indicated because of CRI, DM, low EF as high risk
   markers for short term complications of MI) still to be determined
   pending resolution of acute on chronic renal failure.  Will discuss
   with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4292**].
   Patient care time 40 minutes.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheterized renal transplant. She presented to the hospital with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient's current condition includes chest pain, worsening renal function, fluid overload, and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and NSTEMI, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
2. Renal complications: The patient's worsening renal function and ESRD increase the risk of acute kidney injury or further deterioration in renal function.
3. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid overload and ongoing diuresis may lead to imbalances in electrolytes, particularly potassium.
4. Infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, which increases the risk of infection, particularly at the femoral line site.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain and the use of medications like morphine may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as constipation or bowel ischemia.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to chronic kidney disease or bleeding complications related"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis catheter removal. She presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient's renal function has been gradually improving with each HD session. She is on dual antiplatelet therapy with Plavix and aspirin, as well as statin therapy. Her ejection fraction (EF) has decreased from 60% to 30-35% due to diastolic dysfunction. She also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMII), hypertension, anemia, abdominal pain, hypothyroidism, GERD, gout, and presumed full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening despite HD sessions, which may indicate an acute deterioration in renal function.
2. Cardiorenal syndrome: The patient's CAD and diastolic heart failure may be contributing to her renal dysfunction.
3. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient may have developed contrast-induced nephropathy due to exposure to contrast during imaging procedures.
4. Infection: The patient has a femoral line and has received HD, which increases the risk of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with CAD, diastolic HF, afib on warfarin, ESRD s/p DCD renal tx in
   [**2160**] presented from OSH with NSTEMI now with worsening renal failure
   requiring HD.
   .
   #Fluid overload: [**12-29**] CHF. Requiring less O2.  Trial of Lasix 120 [**7-29**] AM
   with UOP increased to 539 over the day. HD has removed 5.5L over past 4
   days.
   - Will get Lasix 120 IV bid today and hold HD. If pt continues to
   respond will not need further HD.
   - On Duonebs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: ESRD [**12-29**] DMII/HTN s/p DCD transplant
   in [**2160**]. Baseline Cr [**12-30**] since [**1-3**] with Cr 2.9 on admission.
   Increasing since admission. Likely [**12-29**] cardiorenal vs contrast induced
   nephropathy. Transplant on board - on Cellcept, Prednisone, Prograf.
   Received femoral line and HD on [**7-27**] and has gotten HD x3.
   - Renal transplant following. Continue anti-rejection meds.
   - Will hold off HD today as well as IR tunneled line placement. Will
   reassess on Friday after Lasix trial.
   - Would pull femoral line today given risk of infxn.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with h/o CAD with stress test [**2165**] showing some
   anteroapical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia. Presented
   to OSH with NSTEMI and CE peak TnT 5.07 MB 40.04 and echo showing
   anteroapical akinesis. Nitro gtt did not help with pain. Decreased EF
   [**7-24**] to 40-45% and [**7-27**] to 30-35%. Plavix 300 x1 on arrival. s/p
   Heparin gtt.
   - On Plavix 75 mg
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80 mg
   - Discontinued Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 7**] given low HR and prior pause on
   tele
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has baseline diastolic dysfunction with marked pulmonary HTN
   (TR gradient 60-70). EF decreased to 40-45% on [**7-24**] and 30-35% on [**7-27**]
   from baseline 60% on [**3-5**]. Likely [**12-29**] to NSTEMI. Decreased UOP, thought
   to be combination of low flow and acute renal failure.
   - Metoprolol stopped
   - No ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given patient had SE of cough while on ACEi in the past
   and now in [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Would not start Spironolactone given K sparing effects in light of
   [**Last Name (un) **].
   .
   # RHYTHM: history of PAF s/p failed cardioversion x 2, on long term
   coumadin as well as history of bradyarrhythmia. INR 5.1 on admission
   given VitK 2.5 SQ. On tele pt is intermittently in a-fib with rate
   70s-85. Pause for 6sec at 7:10 and 3sec at 22:00 on [**7-26**]. D/Cd
   metoprolol.
   - Coumadin stopped, heparin ggt started for better monitoring, and
   because patient may need further HD related procedures.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   .
   # DMII, c/b neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy: On NPH 18u qhs and
   insulin SS. NPH dose was missed last night. Given
 dose this morning
   and will give full dose if pt is not going to IR. On Levemir 25-30u qhs
   at home
 would transition back tonight.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive to SBPs 160s on admission. BP labile in
   CCU. On and off nitro gtt.  Home meds Amlodipine, Clonidine,
   Hydralazine, Furosemide.
   - On Amlodipine 5 po qd and Lasix.
   - Could readd Hydralazine today.
   .
   # Anemia: On oral iron. H/H recovering after 2-3u dropped after fem
   line placement and nitro gtt. Baseline [**9-25**].
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Resolved, no longer diffusely tender. CT abdomen did
   not show any signs of mesenteric ischemia. Likely [**12-29**] embolism from
   coronary event vs constipation.
   - Continue bowel regimen with soap suds enemas PRN, senna, colace,
   psyllium.
   - Currently on diluadid and morphine PRN for pain control.
   - Continue to monitor abdominal exam for peritoneal signs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation (afib) on warfarin, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dominant cytotoxic drug (DCD) renal transplant in 2160. She presented to the hospital with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anemia. She is currently on multiple medications including Plavix, ASA, Atorvastatin, Metoprolol, Cellcept, Prednisone, Prograf, Levemir, and Amlodipine among others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 2.9 on admission, which has been increasing. This indicates worsening renal function, and the patient may require further HD.
2. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and presented with NSTEMI. Her ejection fraction (EF) decreased from 60% to 40-45% and then to 30-35%. There is ongoing concern for ischemic heart disease.
