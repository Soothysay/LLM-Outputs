","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a newly found malignancy, final pathology not yet available. He presented with significant gastrointestinal bleeding, which is unclear whether it is from the tumor, biopsy, or sphincterotomy. The patient underwent an emergency procedure called embolization to control the bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 139 bpm, blood pressure of 125/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient received a blood transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). He also received medication for an allergic reaction, including solumedrol and Benadryl. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count of 325 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 187 mg/dL. 

The patient has several medical complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy, malignancy NOS with locally invasive and peritoneal metastasis, and a fever. 

The patient's plan of care includes continuing proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip, nasogastric tube with ice water lavage"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a newly found malignancy, likely lymphoma. The patient experienced a significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, resulting in the need for resuscitation and blood transfusion. The patient underwent an embolization procedure overnight but is still experiencing bleeding with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 21. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 139 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 125/71 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, scleral icterus, and mild hepatomegaly. Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.8 K/uL, low platelet count (Plt) of 325 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hct) of 23.8%, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleeding: The patient has experienced a significant GI bleed, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation status is compromised due to resuscitation and blood transfusion. This increases the risk of further bleeding and complications related to clotting disorders.
3. Hypothermia: The patient exhibited low temperature"

   5) Coagulopathy
   Patient with massive UGI bleed, most likely secondary to tumor.
   Embolization attempted this morning. Patient being monitored closely.
   Tachycardia persists. Blood products and volume resuscitation continue.
   Elevated lactate concerning for hypoperfusion, although it was measured
   during his transfusion reaction and may represent rigoring/muscle
   actvity; should be repeated. Normal BUN/Creat argues for fairly good
   volume resuscitation.  INR still mildly elevated; monitor for further
   need for FFP. Vitamin K to be administered.
   Patient still appears to be volume depleted by exam. Continue with
   volume resuscitation. Hyponatremia likely reflects increased ADH in the
   setting of volume depletion. Continue blood and volume resuscitation.
   Oxygenation remains good and CXR without evidence of volume overload.
   Patient on antibiotics for possible biliary infection.
   Awaiting pathology from ERCP biopsies.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU for management of a massive upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The suspected source of bleeding has been identified and embolized. The patient remains on suction with an ongoing loss of blood in the stomach. They are also receiving intravenous pantoprazole (Protonix) and meperidine (Demerol).

The patient's vital signs show a tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 110 to 161 beats per minute, and their blood pressure is within normal limits. Respiratory support is not required as the patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates ongoing fluid resuscitation with both crystalloids and blood products.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL and a hematocrit of 21.7%. The platelet count is normal at 325 K/uL. The liver enzymes are elevated with an AST level of 33.8 U/L and an ALT level of 30.0 U/L. The patient's electrolytes show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 118 mEq/L, and the potassium level is slightly low at 3.6 mEq/L. The INR is still mildly elevated at 1.6.

Imaging studies reveal mildly enlarged hilar on chest X-ray.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a newly diagnosed malignancy, likely diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from the tumor, biopsy, or sphincterotomy. The patient received 6 units of blood transfusion and is currently stable with no active bleeding. His coagulopathy has resolved. Surgical backup has been called in case of further bleeding. The patient also has biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy, which was treated with ERCP stenting. His liver function tests are improving. He will undergo radiation therapy (XRT) today. There are concerns about tumor lysis syndrome, so labs will be monitored frequently. The patient's electrolytes are replete. Prophylaxis measures include pneumatic boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's code status is full code. He is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has already experienced significant gastrointestinal bleeding, which may recur or worsen.
2. Tumor lysis syndrome: This is a potential complication of chemotherapy or radiation therapy in patients with high tumor burden, leading to metabolic abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and renal failure.
3. Biliary obstruction: Although stented, there is a risk of recurrent biliary obstruction or complications related"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, and cholangitis. They were transfused yesterday and have stable hemoglobin levels. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving post stent placement. A biopsy revealed B-cell lymphoma, for which the patient is scheduled to start radiation therapy. 

The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 129/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including radiation therapy, administration of antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole), and insertion of various lines for medication and nutrition. The patient's abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender bowel sounds, and no distention or tenderness. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Liver enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are elevated. Kidney function tests reveal normal creatinine (Cr) and electrolyte levels. Blood glucose levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include gastrointestinal bleed"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old male with newly found B-cell lymphoma and significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient underwent radiation therapy for his cancer and received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 27.5% to 24.7%. There were no signs of melena, bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), or vomiting.

The patient also had biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy, which was treated with an ERCP procedure and stent placement. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, and they will be monitored closely.

The patient is currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy as part of his treatment for B-cell lymphoma. Tumor lysis labs are being monitored every six hours, and the urine is being alkalinized with bicarbonate intravenous fluid (IVF) for now.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on a regular diet and receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an 18-gauge line on December 24th at 12:22 AM, a 16-gauge line on December 24th at 01:00 AM, and a 14-gauge line on December 24th at 01:30 AM.
