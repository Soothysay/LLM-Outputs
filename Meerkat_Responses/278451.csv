 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 CARDIAC ARREST
   This is a  23 year old Male with h.o. heroin and benzo abuse/overdose
   p/w PEA arrest after being found down likely [**1-20**] heroin overdose.
   .
   #. s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear as to the exact time pt was in PEA
   arrest. Per peripheral sources pt had witness arrest. Per [**Name (NI) 73**] pt was
   coded for 20-30 minutes receiving 3 rounds of epi, atropine. Pt
   currently paralyzed with bolus of Vecuronium, started on Fentanyl and
   Midazolam for sedation. Now on cooling protocol. Cardiac arrest team,
   Cardiology, Neurology aware of patient.
   - will cool patient for a goal of 32 degrees for next 24 hours (end 4p)
   - sedation c fent and propofol try to wean
   -dc cisatracuronium
   - will continue on 48 hours continuous EEG per cooling protocol
   .
   ##. Transient Hypotension: Pt noted to be hypotensive in the ED and
   started briefly on Levophed, likely [**1-20**] sedation medication. Pt
   currently able to keep MAPs >65. [**Month (only) 51**] again be hypotensive when he is
   cooled, will continue to monitor and bolus with LRs for a goal MAP >65.
   - monitor BPs using A-line
   - goal MAP >65
   - will bolus with NS to maintain pressures x1L cvp goal 12
   .
   ##. Ventilated/cerebral edema: Pt currently ventilated as he is on
   cooling protocol and sedated heavily. First ABG obtained when pt was
   over breathing ventilator.
   -Target pH 7.45 to cause cerebral vasocontstriction to combat cerebral
   edema.
   -consider hypertonic saline will d/w neurology
   -f/u neuro recs, greatly appreciate their advice
   .
   ##. ?Aspiration PNA: Pt noted to have course BS, CXR also shows b/l
   patchy infiltrates. Suspect aspiration PNA, will cover with broad
   spectrum abx with Unasyn.
   - continue on Unasyn
   - obtain blood cultures
   .
   ##. [**Last Name (un) **]: Unknown baseline but pt is young and has no history of renal
   disease, suspect this may ATN given the length of ischaemic down time.
   Pt also at risk for rhabdo given CK of ~20,000
   - Will continue to monitor urine output
   - goal >30 cc/hr, has been meeting or exceeding
   - trend Creatinine
   -continue NS at 250cc/hr to protect against rhabdo injury
   .
   ##. Shock Liver: Pt noted to have transaminitis as well as synthetic
   dysfunction, likely shock liver from length of ischaemia.
   - will continue to trend LFTs, coags
   - continue with supportive care

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of heroin and benzodiazepine abuse/overdose.
- He experienced PEA arrest after being found down likely from a heroin overdose.
- The patient received three rounds of epinephrine and atropine during the cardiac arrest.
- He was successfully resuscitated but had an unclear duration of downtime.
- The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and paralyzed.
- He is being cooled for a goal temperature of 32 degrees for the next 24 hours.
- Continuous EEG monitoring has been initiated per cooling protocol.
- The patient's respiratory failure is not consistent with ARDS.
- He also has hypotension that is not due to shock.
- There are concerns about potential complications such as aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, and hepatic dysfunction.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending.
- Further evaluation with MRI/MRA of the brain is recommended due to the presence of multiple hypodensities in the basal ganglia and internal capsules bilaterally, which may indicate acute ischemia and infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's course breath sounds and bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover this condition.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): Given the length"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of heroin and benzodiazepine abuse who experienced a cardiac arrest after a suspected heroin overdose. The patient was successfully resuscitated but suffered from prolonged ischemia. 

The patient is currently in the ICU for further management. He is intubated, sedated, and paralyzed due to shivering during the cooling protocol. The goal temperature for cooling is 32 degrees Celsius for the next 24 hours. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/77 mmHg to 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), liver enzymes (AST and ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK). The blood glucose level is elevated at 151 mg/dL. Imaging reveals multiple hypodensities in the basal ganglia and internal capsules bilaterally, which are worrisome for acute ischemia and infarction, especially considering the history of cardiac arrest and IV drug use. An MRI/MRA of the brain is recommended for further evaluation.

The patient has respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypotension (not in shock), and a history of cardiac arrest."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 23-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest due to a heroin overdose. The patient underwent a cooling protocol and is now showing signs of diffuse cerebral edema on CT scan, with multiple hypodensities in the internal capsule and basal ganglia, which are worrisome for acute ischemia and infarction. The EEG also showed burst suppression background with intermittent spikes, indicating seizure activity. The patient has been loaded with dilantin and is being considered for an MRI to further evaluate the ischemic brain injury.

The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate ranging from 64-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 66-80 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 28-44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 28 breaths per minute, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, lactate, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium (K+). The arterial blood gas ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 23-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a heroin overdose and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient underwent a cooling protocol and is now showing signs of acute ischemia and infarction in the internal capsule and basal ganglia as seen on a CT head scan. The EEG also indicates burst suppression background with intermittent spikes, which suggests seizure activity. The patient is being loaded with dilantin to manage the seizures.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/66 to 71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 28 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), lactate, lactic acid, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), troponin-T, creatinine (Cr), and levels of electrolytes such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old male who suffered from cardiac arrest due to a heroin overdose. He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications. The patient's conditions include altered mental status, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, seizure activity, hyperosmolality, oliguria/anuria, anoxic brain damage, respiratory failure, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. The patient's recent progress includes worsening cerebral edema, increased seizure activity, fever, and possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient also has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock liver from the prolonged ischemia. There is swelling in the right upper extremity (RUE), but no evidence of compartment syndrome. The patient is receiving hypertonic saline for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and is being closely monitored for any changes in neurological status. The family has been informed about the grave prognosis, and further discussions regarding goals of care are needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased ICP: The patient is at risk for further increases in cerebral edema and ICP, which can lead to herniation and death.
2. Seizure activity: The patient has ongoing seizure activity, which needs to be managed with appropriate antiepileptic medications.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a"

   Imaging: CT head -Diffusely increased cerebral edema since [**9-11**] exam,
   with further sulcal effacement and slight decrease in size of
   ventricles. No evidence of
   herniation at this time. No ICH .
   MRI head - Extensive abnormalities, with restricted diffusion in the
   caudate and basal
   ganglia as seen on prior CT; also restricted diffusion in the parieto-
   occipital lobes bilaterally; c/w infarcts. Parieto-occipital
   abnormalities
   likely more acute, given relatively little FLAIR signal in these areas.
   Increased FLAIR signal in the cerebellum bilaterally likely related to
   edema. Difficult to compare degree of edema to the prior CT; refer to
   CT obtained at 2100 hours.

 CARDIAC ARREST
   23 yom s/p cadiac arrest via heroin overdose.
   #. S/p cardiac arrest:
   -patient is now s/p cooling protocol
   -CE trending down
   #. Cerebral Edema: CT head concerning for BG and IC ischemia and
   seizure activity demonstrated by EEG. New posturing yesterday.
   Increased edema on imaging.
   - gradually wean sedation for more thorough neurological evaluation
   - continue dilantin and keppra per neurology for ongoing seizure
   activity; both redosed as per renal/neuro recs
   -hypertonic saline to keep osm 320. Not candidate for ICP monitor as
   per neurosurg. Neuro unable to give prognosis, family aware that
   prognosis is likely grave.
   ##. Possible Aspiration PNA: patient intially noted to have coarse BS
   with initial CXR demonstrating bilateral patchy infiltrates; febrile
   last night to 100.8
   - continue Unasyn
   - f/u cultures and CXR
   ##. [**Last Name (un) **]: patient with unknown baseline but suspect ATN given prolonged
   ischemia and now elevated Cr in the setting of rhabdomylosis and
   myoglobin load.
   - continue to monitor urine output and trend Cr
 continuing to rise
   - As per renal, likely ATN c/b rhabdo- will spin urine sediment; hold
   off on repleting calcium; if cerebral edema can handle, consider some
   IVF to increase renal flow, but since CK decreasing and pt likely has
   ATN, not an absolute priority;  no urgent need for HD as of yet
   -hold all nephrotoxins; dose meds for creatinine clearance of 10- have
   to check daily if need to redose unasyn and keppra
   ##. Shock Liver: patient initially presenting with transaminitis likely
   representing shock liver from prolonged ischemia
   - continue trend LFT's and coags (trending down)
   # RUE edema: likely [**1-20**] prolonged down time, no evidence of compartment
   syndrome on exam
    -seen by plastics, who did not think there was concern for CS and did
   not do compartment pressures
   - RUE u/s showed no DVT, only superficial
   -elevate arm, ACE bandages

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 23-year-old male who suffered from cardiac arrest due to a heroin overdose. He has been in the ICU since then and has developed multiple medical complications. 

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing confusion and changes in consciousness.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has muscle breakdown, which can lead to kidney damage and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Seizure: The patient had a seizure, possibly due to brain damage from the lack of oxygen during cardiac arrest.
5. Hyperosmolarity: The patient has high serum osmolality, indicating an imbalance in the concentration of solutes in the blood.
6. Oliguria/anuria: The patient is producing very little urine or no urine at all.
7. Anoxic brain damage: The patient has suffered brain damage due to insufficient oxygen supply during cardiac arrest.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing and requires mechanical ventilation.
9. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low.
10. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a previous cardiac arrest.

The patient is currently being treated with various medications, including hypertonic saline to manage cerebral edema, antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and levetiracetam) for"
