   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a  75M with many medical problems, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by PNA,
   NSTEMI, who is now transferred to MICU with shock.
   .
   #Sepsis: Pleural fluid with GN diplococci on gram stain, GNR in
   culture.  Bloo,d urine, stool still pending. Though pleural fluid has
   not been cultured previously, it is concerning that this infection
   developed while on Meropenem.  He also has pleural effusion on Left
   that has never been tapped but clearly is high risk for infection as
   well.
   -Broad antibiotic coverage: Zosyn, dapto, flagyl.
   -ID consult
   -stress dose steroids
   -maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   -R pigtail draining well
   -consult IP/Thoracics for L pigtail vs chest tube (hold heparin gtt for
   this procedure)
   .
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: pt was scheduled to go for AKA and fem/fem bypass,
   however,  procedure on hold given clinical instability currently.
   -wound care
   -on heparin gtt
   -appreciate surgery recs
   -standing Tylenol, neurontin for pain control
   .
   #Apnea: had apnic spells overnight. Likely has undiagnosed OSA.
   Started on Bipap with autotitrate, did well.
   -continue bipap at night in house
   -will eventually need outpt sleep study
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out yesterday; no
   current EKG changes.
   -already on heparin gtt
   -continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   -hold BB given hypotension
   -on statin
   .
   #CHF:  Diastolic, preserved EF.   Total body fluid overloaded, but
   Hypotensive.
   -unable to diurese at present given hypotension
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   .
   #Rhythm: has afib, but currently in sinus rhythm.
   -on heparin
   -holding BB for now
   .
   #COPD: scheduled and PRN nebs
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: on heparin gtt, bowel regimen PRN
   .
   # Access: central line, a line, PICC
   .
   # Nutrition- very poor nutritional status.
   -place NGT, start tube feeds.
   .
   # Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a history of necrotic foot. He was initially admitted for the surgical wound infection but developed complications such as PNA (presumably pneumonia) and NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient is now in the MICU (medical intensive care unit) with shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has pleural fluid with gram-negative diplococci on gram stain and GNR in culture, indicating a possible bacterial infection. Blood, urine, and stool cultures are pending. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn, daptomycin, metronidazole) and an ID (infectious disease) consult has been requested.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion on the left side, which has never been tapped. This effusion is high risk for infection as well.

3. PVD/Necrotic Foot: The patient has a necrotic foot and was scheduled for an above-knee amputation (AKA) and femoral-popliteal bypass procedure. However, this procedure has been put on hold due to the patient's current clinical instability.

4. Apnea: The patient had apneic spells overnight, likely due to undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OS"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a  75M with many medical problems, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by PNA,
   NSTEMI, who is now transferred to MICU with shock.
   .
   #Sepsis: Pleural fluid with GN diplococci on gram stain, GNR in
   culture.  Bloo,d urine, stool still pending. Though pleural fluid has
   not been cultured previously, it is concerning that this infection
   developed while on Meropenem.  He also has pleural effusion on Left
   that has never been tapped but clearly is high risk for infection as
   well.
   -Broad antibiotic coverage: Zosyn, dapto, flagyl.
   -ID consult
   -stress dose steroids
   -maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   -R pigtail draining well
   -consult IP/Thoracics for L pigtail vs chest tube (hold heparin gtt for
   this procedure)
   .
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: pt was scheduled to go for AKA and fem/fem bypass,
   however,  procedure on hold given clinical instability currently.
   -wound care
   -on heparin gtt
   -appreciate surgery recs
   -standing Tylenol, neurontin for pain control
   .
   #Apnea: had apnic spells overnight. Likely has undiagnosed OSA.
   Started on Bipap with autotitrate, did well.
   -continue bipap at night in house
   -will eventually need outpt sleep study
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out yesterday; no
   current EKG changes.
   -already on heparin gtt
   -continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   -hold BB given hypotension
   -on statin
   .
   #CHF:  Diastolic, preserved EF.   Total body fluid overloaded, but
   Hypotensive.
   -unable to diurese at present given hypotension
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's

The patient has pleural fluid with Gram-negative diplococci on gram stain, GNR in culture, blood and stool still pending. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated. The patient's left pleural effusion needs further evaluation. The patient's PVD/necrotic foot procedure has been put on hold due to clinical instability. The patient experienced apnea spells overnight and started on BiPAP with autotitrate. The patient has a history of CAD with recent NSTEMI and prior BMS. The patient's CHF is diastolic with preserved EF, and the patient is hypotensive. The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's COPD requires scheduled and PRN nebs. The patient's nutritional status is poor and requires tube feeds. The patient's code status is full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems admitted initially with a surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and shock. The patient was transferred to the MICU with sepsis, pleural effusion, and necrotic foot. He is currently on broad antibiotic coverage and has been started on stress dose steroids. The patient's condition remains poor with a high risk for aspiration, and he is likely to require percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) at the time of vascular surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's pleural fluid culture showed growth of Gram-negative rods, indicating a possible infection. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it is important to monitor for any signs of worsening sepsis or infection.
2. Aspiration: Due to the patient's high risk for aspiration, there is a potential for respiratory complications if proper precautions are not taken during feeding or oral suctioning.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's initial admission was complicated by pneumonia, and there is a possibility of recurrent or new infections, especially if the patient is unable to protect his airway.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recent NSTEMI. Monitoring for any changes in cardiac status or signs of heart failure is essential.
5. Chronic obstruct"

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of thoracic surgery, admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and septic shock. The patient has a past medical history of COPD, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Allergies include vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/52 to 135/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, daptomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole. A pigtail catheter was placed in the left pleural effusion, and the effusion has improved significantly. The right pleural effusion remains stable. The patient's chest X-ray shows good re-expansion of the left lung with nearly resolved left effusion, but there are still basilar opacities and a stable right effusion.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated blood glucose, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging and microbiology reports indicate the presence of gram-negative rods in the left pleural"

   -will eventually need outpt sleep study
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out yesterday; no
   current EKG changes.
   -already on heparin gtt
   -continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   -hold BB given hypotension
   -on statin
   .
   #CHF:  Diastolic, preserved EF.   Total body fluid overloaded, but
   Hypotensive.
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even to -500 cc
s neg
   .
   #Rhythm: has afib, but currently in sinus rhythm.
   -on heparin
   -holding BB for now
   .
   #COPD: scheduled and PRN nebs
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: on heparin gtt, bowel regimen PRN
   .
   # Access: central line, a line.  Will discontinue PICC today
   .
   # Nutrition- very poor nutritional status.
   -place NGT, start tube feeds.
   -need to discuss PEG with family
consider PEG placement at time of
   vascular procedure (?Monday)

   On this day I was present with and reviewed today's note of Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5182**] for the key portion of the service provided.  I agree with the
   findings and plan of care.

   Additional addendum to plan for the day:
   # Sepsis: Will continue meropenem for coverage of klebsiella.
   Acinetobacter could be a contaminant. Per ID, will discontinue
   daptomycin today. Patient has remained Afebrile with decreasing
   leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable overnight
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - continue meropenem
 will continue until last pleural fluid culture
   comes back to decide on abx course
   - continue stress dose steroids (day #[**2-21**] today) and continue tapering
   down tomorrow
   .
   # PNA: Patient with klebsiella PNA with bilateral loculated effusions.
   Bilateral pigtail catheters draining well.
   - f/u ID regarding course of meropenem
   - resend sputum culture
   - continue to follow pigtail catheter drainage and consider repeat CT
   when drainage decreases
   .
   # CV: Patient with afib with some episodes of tachycardia. Being
   titrated up slowly on beta blocker as previously had some decrease in
   BP with increased metoprolol
   - increased metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for improved rate control (home
   dose is 50mg PO TID)
   - cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, consider persantine stress test prior to
   vascular surgery
   .
   # PVD/necrotic foot: Still on table for patient to go for AKA and
   fem/fem bypass. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to take
   patient to OR if cleared medically. Patient
s pain uncontrolled on PO
   oxycodone.
   - vascular surgery recs on whether candidate for surgery
   - continue heparin gtt
   - trial of IV morphine for pain control
   .
   # Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be
   going for surgery and then hold another family meeting. [**Hospital 5524**] medical
   team can discuss patient
s medical clearance and risks/benefits. Family
   still very interested in pursuing surgery.
   Rest of plan is unchanged from above.

   on:[**2125-9-9**] 17:58 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection and his hospital course was complicated by PNA and NSTEMI. He was transferred to the MICU with shock.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has pleural fluid with gram-negative diplococci on gram stain, and gram-negative rods in culture. Blood, urine, and stool cultures are still pending. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated, and the ID input is appreciated. The patient's sepsis is being managed with appropriate antibiotics and source control measures.

2. PVD/Necrotic foot: The patient has peripheral vascular disease with necrotic changes in his toes. He is scheduled for above-knee amputation (AKA) and femoral-popliteal bypass, but the procedure has been held due to the patient's clinical instability. Wound care and heparin gtt are being continued.

3. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent NSTEMI. He has a bare metal stent (BMS) and is already on heparin gtt. Aspirin and Plavix are being continued, and beta-blockers are being held due"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of a pulled PICC line and tip sent for culture. The patient has been on various antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole, Daptomycin, and Meropenem. He is currently receiving heparin drip and steroids were decreased at the recommendation of endocrinology.

The patient's allergies include Vancomycin, Exfoliative [**Doctor Last Name**], and Linezolid. The last doses of antibiotics were given on [**2125-9-7**] at 11:47 AM for Piperacillin/Tazobactam and on [**2125-9-8**] at 04:00 AM for Metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 104 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 145/70 to 103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP mask. The patient's height is 69 inches and CVP is 15 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,307 mL and total output of 2,358 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -51 mL. The patient's urine output is 918 mL, and NG output is 439 mL. The patient has left dry gangrene of toes, and his right and left radial pulses as well as right and left digital pulses are not assessed. The patient has rhonchi bilaterally on chest examination.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 23.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, sodium of 126 mg/dL, potassium of 4.5 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, and platelet count of 568 K/uL. The patient's troponin T levels are decreasing, and other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being provided with ICU care, including nutrition via Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 50 mL/hour and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has multi-lumen and arterial lines in place. Prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis prevention, systemic anticoagulation with heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and elevation of head of bed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include but are not limited to:
1. Infection: The patient has a pulled PICC line with the tip sent for culture, indicating a possible infection. Additionally, the patient has been on multiple antibiotics, suggesting ongoing concerns about infection.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 568 K/uL, which could indicate thrombocytopenia or low platelet count.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 0.5 mg/dL, which may suggest renal dysfunction.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient has dry gangrene of toes and rhonchi bilaterally on chest examination, which could indicate potential respiratory complications.
5. Cardiovascular problems: The patient has atrial fibrillation and varying blood pressure readings, suggesting possible cardiovascular issues.
6. Nutritional concerns: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential nutritional deficiencies or inadequate fluid intake.
7. Gangrene: The presence of dry gangrene of toes is concerning and may require further evaluation and management.

   -standing Tylenol, neurontin for pain control
   -discuss timing of surgery with Vascular
consider Monday as he is
   clinically much better today and needs the surgery if he is to ever
   regain health
   .
   #Apnea: Likely has undiagnosed OSA.  Started on Bipap with autotitrate,
   did well.
   -continue bipap at night in house
   -will eventually need outpt sleep study
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out yesterday; no
   current EKG changes.
   -already on heparin gtt
   -continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   -hold BB given hypotension
   -on statin
   .
   #CHF:  Diastolic, preserved EF.   Total body fluid overloaded, but
   Hypotensive.
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even to -500 cc
s neg
   .
   #Rhythm: has afib, but currently in sinus rhythm.
   -on heparin
   -holding BB for now
   .
   #COPD: scheduled and PRN nebs
   .
   # FEN: replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: on heparin gtt, bowel regimen PRN
   .
   # Access: central line, a line.  Will discontinue PICC today
   .
   # Nutrition- very poor nutritional status.
   -place NGT, start tube feeds.
   -need to discuss PEG with family
consider PEG placement at time of
   vascular procedure (?Monday)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems who was admitted initially with a surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the patient is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) with shock.

The patient's current medical conditions include sepsis, peripheral vascular disease/necrotic foot, apnea, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), electrolyte imbalance, and poor nutritional status.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a confirmed infection in the pleural fluid with gram-negative diplococci on gram stain, and GNR in culture. Blood, urine, and stool cultures are still pending. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated, but the patient remains at risk for further complications of sepsis.

2. Peripheral Vascular Disease/Necrotic Foot: The patient has necrotic lesions in the lower extremities due to peripheral vascular disease. There is a concern for possible amputation, and the patient is scheduled for vascular surgery. If the surgery is delayed or unsuccessful, the patient may develop additional complications related to poor circulation in the lower extremities.

3. Apnea: The patient likely has undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was initially admitted for a surgical wound infection and has since developed several complications, including sepsis, necrotic foot, apnea, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and malnutrition. The patient's current condition is critical, and he requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to pleural fluid infection and gram-negative bacteria in culture. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but blood, urine, and stool cultures are still pending. There is a concern for further spread of infection and potential organ failure.

2. Necrotic Foot: The patient has a necrotic foot with gangrene, which requires surgical intervention. However, the procedure has been postponed due to the patient's clinical instability. Without timely surgery, there is a risk of worsening foot condition and potential amputation.

3. Apnea: The patient likely has undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Bipap with autotitration has been started, and it appears to be well-tolerated. However, the patient may need ongoing respiratory support at night and eventually an outpatient sleep study.

4. Coronary Artery"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and necrotic foot. He was initially admitted for a surgical wound infection and later transferred to the MICU with shock. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, PVD/necrotic foot, apnea, CAD, CHF, rhythm disturbance, COPD, and poor nutritional status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Immediate management of sepsis is crucial to prevent further complications.
2. PVD/Necrotic Foot: The patient has a necrotic foot due to peripheral vascular disease. This condition can lead to serious complications such as gangrene or the need for amputation if not managed properly.
3. Apnea: The patient may have undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, which can cause breathing difficulties during sleep and increase the risk of cardiovascular problems.
4. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). There is a risk of further cardiac events if not managed appropriately.
5. CHF: The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Fluid overload and hypotension need to be carefully managed to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has several medical conditions, including chronic critical illness, poor peripheral vascular disease (PVD), peripheral lower extremity ischemia, poor skin integrity, chronic Acinetobacter infection in the pleural space, poor swallow and cough, cachexia, and painful contracted extremities.

The patient's sepsis is reported to be overall improved, as they are now spontaneously breathing, mentally alert, and no longer require pressor support. However, there is a need for clarification regarding the goals of care, as the patient wishes to eat and is unsure if they will ever be considered a surgical candidate for their PVD.

The patient's current medications include pravastatin, aspirin, lopressor, prevacid, neurontin, atrovent, risperidone, clopidogrel, synthroid, heparin gtt, tylenol, and hydrocortisone. The patient also has a PICC line that was stopped, an EKG performed, and has received various antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, daptomycin, and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/53 mmHg to 149/76 mmHg, respiratory rate"

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically critically ill individual with ongoing issues of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), peripheral left lower extremity ischemia, poor skin integrity, chronic Acinetobacter infection in the pleural space, poor swallow and cough, cachexia, and painful contracted extremities. The patient is currently being treated for sepsis and has shown overall improvement, with no longer requiring pressor support. The patient's goals of care need to be clarified as they have expressed a desire to eat and are uncertain about their eligibility for surgical intervention for PVD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): The patient's PVD puts them at risk for further complications such as gangrene, non-healing wounds, or even limb amputation if not properly managed.
2. Peripheral left lower extremity ischemia: This condition can lead to decreased blood flow to the leg, potentially resulting in tissue damage, necrosis, or loss of the affected limb if not promptly addressed.
3. Chronic Acinetobacter infection in the pleural space: This infection increases the risk of developing antibiotic resistance and may require prolonged antibiotic therapy. It can also lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of respiratory function.
4. Poor skin integrity: The patient's poor skin integrity makes them susceptible to pressure ulcers, infections, and impaired wound healing.
5. Cachexia: This condition can further weaken the patient's overall health status, making them more prone"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75M with many medical problems, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by PNA,
   NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock.
   .
   #Sepsis: Pleural fluid from [**9-7**] growing with acinetobacter. Will
   continue meropenem for coverage of klebsiella. Patient has remained
   Afebrile with decreasing leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable
   overnight. Patient improved
   -appreciate ID  input
   -maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   -b/l pigtails draining well
   -scheduled nasal suctioning
   -high risk for aspiration, likely will require PEG at time of vascular
   surgery
   - continue meropenem
 will continue until last pleural fluid culture
   comes back to decide on abx course
   - continue stress dose steroids (day #[**3-24**] today) and continue tapering
   down tomorrow
   # PNA: Patient with klebsiella PNA with bilateral loculated effusions.
   Bilateral pigtail catheters draining well.
   - f/u ID regarding course of meropenem
   - resend sputum culture
   - continue to follow pigtail catheter drainage and consider repeat CT
   when drainage decreases
   .
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: pt was scheduled to go for AKA and fem/fem bypass,
   however,  procedure was held due to clinical instability.
   -wound care
   -on heparin gtt
   -appreciate surgery recs
   -standing Tylenol, neurontin for pain control
   -discuss timing of surgery with Vascular
consider Monday as he is
   clinically much better today and needs the surgery if he is to ever
   regain health
   # PVD/necrotic foot: Still on table for patient to go for AKA and
   fem/fem bypass. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to take
   patient to OR if cleared medically. Patient
s pain uncontrolled on PO
   oxycodone.
   - vascular surgery recs on whether candidate for surgery
   - continue heparin gtt
   - trial of IV morphine for pain control
   .
   #Apnea: Likely has undiagnosed OSA.  Started on Bipap with autotitrate,
   did well.
   -continue bipap at night in house
   -will eventually need outpt sleep study
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out yesterday; no
   current EKG changes.
   -already on heparin gtt
   -continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   -hold BB given hypotension
   -on statin
   CV: Patient with afib with some episodes of tachycardia. Being titrated
   up slowly on beta blocker as previously had some decrease in BP with
   increased metoprolol
   - increased metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for improved rate control (home
   dose is 50mg PO TID)
   - cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, consider persantine stress test prior to
   vascular surgery
   .
   #CHF:  Diastolic, preserved EF.   Total body fluid overloaded, but
   Hypotensive.
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even to -500 cc
s neg
   .
   #Rhythm: has afib, but currently in sinus rhythm.
   -on heparin
   -holding BB for now
   .
   #COPD: scheduled and PRN nebs

   # FEN: replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: on heparin gtt, bowel regimen PRN
   .
   # Access: central line, a line.  Will discontinue PICC today
   .
   # Nutrition- very poor nutritional status.
   -place NGT, start tube feeds.
   -need to discuss PEG with family
consider PEG placement at time of
   vascular procedure (?Monday)

   .
   # Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be
   going for surgery and then hold another family meeting. [**Hospital 5524**] medical
   team can discuss patient
s medical clearance and risks/benefits. Family
   still very interested in pursuing surgery.

   Pt is a 75M with many medical problems, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by PNA,
   NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  patient not interactive this morning,
   ABG was checked and PCO2 72. patient started on autoset CPAP with
   oxygen. Patient with COPD on home O2
   - continue CPAP for now, maintaining sats
   - follow gasses
   - on 2L home O2 for COPD.
   - consider intubating if continues to be hypercarbic
   - Standing nebs
   Sepsis/PNA: Pleural fluid from [**9-7**] growing acinetobacter. Will
   continue meropenem for coverage of klebsiella. Patient has remained
   Afebrile with decreasing leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable
   overnight. Patient improved
   - appreciate ID  input: will clarify treatment for acinetobacter,
   possible that it is colonization, but only possible source for
   deterioration.
   - maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   - b/l pigtails draining well
   - scheduled nasal suctioning
   - high risk for aspiration, likely will require PEG at time of vascular
   surgery
   - continue meropenem for Klebsiella Day 1: [**2125-8-31**]. (although first
   dose 9/9). 14 day course
   - taper stress dose steroids (day #[**3-24**] today) to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   PVD/Necrotic foot: Still on table for patient to go for AKA and fem/fem
   bypass. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to take patient to
   OR if cleared medically
   - wound care
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - standing Tylenol, neurontin for pain control
   - vascular surgery recs on whether candidate for surgery
   - trial of IV morphine for pain control
   Apnea: Likely has undiagnosed OSA.  Currently on CPAP for hypercarbia
   -continue bipap at night in house
   -will eventually need outpt sleep study
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out yesterday; no current
   EKG changes.
   -already on heparin gtt
   -continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   -hold BB given hypotension
   -on statin
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia. Being titrated up slowly on beta blocker as previously had
   some decrease in BP with increased metoprolol
   - increased metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for improved rate control (home
   dose is 50mg PO TID)
   - cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolving
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, admitted initially with a surgical wound infection and a complicated hospital course by pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and shock. The patient has been transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and is currently on CPAP for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient also has sepsis/pneumonia with pleural fluid growing Acinetobacter and remains afebrile with decreasing leukocytosis. The patient is hemodynamically stable overnight and improved. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to follow commands and altered mental status, along with an ABG showing a PCO2 of 72, indicate a need for continued CPAP support. If the patient continues to be hypercarbic, intubation may be considered.
2. Sepsis/PNA: The presence of Acinetobacter in the pleural fluid indicates a bacterial infection. The patient is currently on meropenem for coverage, but further evaluation and treatment may be required.
3. PVD/Necrotic Foot: The patient has a necrotic foot and is being considered for amputation and femoral-femoral bypass surgery. The decision to proceed with surgery will depend on the patient's medical clearance.
4. Apnea: The patient likely has undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OS"

   dose is 50mg PO TID)
   - cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, consider persantine stress test prior to
   vascular surgery
   .
   #CHF:  Diastolic, preserved EF.   Total body fluid overloaded, but
   Hypotensive.
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected vascular surgery complications. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his current vital signs include a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 136/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including metoprolol, morphine, heparin, and meropenem. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, with total fluid intake of 2,462 mL and total fluid output of 1,673 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with an ABG showing pH 7.35, PaCO2 60 mmHg, and PaO2 77 mmHg. Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, and no skin or neurologic assessments performed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 15.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 30.1%, platelet count (Plt) at 484 K/uL, blood glucose at 147 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 0.7 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges."

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated
   yesterday for hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated yesterday after
   noted to be less responsive, hypercarbic, and failed CPAP trial. Could
   be secondary to infection, prior history of COPD
   - continue CPAP for now, maintaining sats
   - follow gasses
   - on 2L home O2 for COPD.
   - consider intubating if continues to be hypercarbic
   - Standing nebs
   Sepsis/PNA: Pleural fluid from [**9-7**] growing acinetobacter. Will
   continue meropenem for coverage of klebsiella. Patient has remained
   Afebrile with decreasing leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable
   overnight. Patient improved
   - appreciate ID  input: will clarify treatment for acinetobacter,
   possible that it is colonization, but only possible source for
   deterioration.
   - maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   - b/l pigtails draining well
   - scheduled nasal suctioning
   - high risk for aspiration, likely will require PEG at time of vascular
   surgery
   - continue meropenem for Klebsiella Day 1: [**2125-8-31**]. (although first
   dose 9/9). 14 day course
   - taper stress dose steroids (day #[**3-24**] today) to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   PVD/Necrotic foot: Still on table for patient to go for AKA and fem/fem
   bypass. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to take patient to
   OR if cleared medically
   - wound care
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - standing Tylenol, neurontin for pain control
   - vascular surgery recs on whether candidate for surgery
   - trial of IV morphine for pain control
   Apnea: Likely has undiagnosed OSA.  Currently on CPAP for hypercarbia
   -continue bipap at night in house
   -will eventually need outpt sleep study
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out yesterday; no current
   EKG changes.
   -already on heparin gtt
   -continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   -hold BB given hypotension
   -on statin
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia. Being titrated up slowly on beta blocker as previously had
   some decrease in BP with increased metoprolol
   - increased metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for improved rate control (home
   dose is 50mg PO TID)
   - cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolving
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even to -500 cc
s neg, given 20mg IV Lasix this AM
   FEN: replete lytes prn
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds.
   -need to discuss PEG with family
consider PEG placement at time of
   vascular procedure (?Monday)
   .
   Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)
   .
   # Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5440**]
 family meeting with
   daughter and wife on phone today at 1 pm.
   # Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be
   going for surgery and then hold another family meeting. [**Hospital 5524**] medical
   team can discuss patient
s medical clearance and risks/benefits. Family
   still very interested in pursuing surgery.

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated
   yesterday for hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated yesterday after
   noted to be less responsive, hypercarbic, and failed CPAP trial.
   Suspect that his respiratory failure is secondary to pulmonary
   infection, prior history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and
   likely aspiration of tube feeds. With increase in respiratory rate,
   ABGs have demonstrated improved oxygenation.
   - Will attempt to go back down on rate, re-assess with repeat ABG later
   today.
   - Continue meropenem for klebseilla PNA, today is day 13 of 14.
   - Appreciate ID commenting on whether to cover patient for
   acinetobacter given respiratory decline.
   - Will need to continue to have discussions with family re: goals of
   care, as given need for intubation for the 2^nd time, may need to
   discuss other options such as tracheostomy.
   - Daily trial off sedation to assess mental status.
   Sepsis/PNA: Pleural fluid from [**9-7**] growing acinetobacter, sputum with
   klebseilla. Patient has remained afebrile, but of note he had been on
   standing Tylenol.  No leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable overnight
   after intubation period once levophed off.
   - Appreciate ID  input: will clarify treatment for acinetobacter,
   possible that it is colonization, but could be possible source for
   deterioration.
   - Maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to draining well, so will need
   to remain in place.
   - Scheduled nasal suctioning
   - Tube feeds noted to be suctioned out of ETT tube, so will attempt to
   place Dobhoff today, will likely will require PEG at time of vascular
   surgery
   - Continue meropenem for Klebsiella Day 1: [**2125-8-31**]. (although first
   dose 9/9). 14 day course
should end tomorrow.
   - Will stop stress dose steroids (today is day 5 of 5), yesterday had
   changed to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   PVD/Necrotic foot: Today, noted to have dusky extremities, which were
   improved upon repeat examination. Pulses palpable, so less likely
   embolic given improvement. Could be secondary to pressors, but patient
   was only on levophed transiently. Likely also related to bad vascular
   disease.  Currently, plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold until
   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Hold standing Tylenol to better monitor fever curve, but for now will
   continue neurontin for pain control
may need to cut down or d/c if
   having difficulty assessing mental status.
   - vascular surgery recs on whether candidate for surgery
   - trial of IV morphine for pain control
   Apnea: Likely was contributing to hypercarbic failure. Will need outpt
   sleep study and BiPAP at night if extubated.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out this week; no current
   EKG changes.
   -already on heparin gtt
   -continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   -hold BB given hypotension
   -on statin
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia. Being titrated up slowly on beta blocker as previously had
   some decrease in BP with increased metoprolol
   - Increased metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for improved rate control (home
   dose is 50mg PO TID)
as tolerated by BP, currently being held, will
   plan to re-intiated in AM after d/c stress steroids today and ensuring
   that BP remains stable.
   - Cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolving
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even to -500 cc
s neg.
   FEN: replete lytes prn
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
given concerns re:aspiration, will need to attempt to
   place dobhoff today (post-pylorus), and will need to discuss PEG with
   family
consider PEG placement (possibly at time of vascular surgery or
   tracheostomy).

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including COPD and OSA. He was admitted initially for a surgical wound infection and has had a hospital course complicated by pneumonia, NSTEMI, and shock. The patient was transferred to the MICU and intubated yesterday for hypercarbic respiratory distress. He failed CPAP and required intubation due to hypercarbic failure, likely secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and possible aspiration of tube feeds. The patient's dusky extremities improved upon repeat examination, indicating possible vascular disease rather than embolic phenomenon. The patient's family is considering vascular surgery, but the patient's medical stability needs to be assessed before proceeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.
2. Sepsis/PNA: The patient has pleural fluid growing acinetobacter and sputum with klebsiella. He remains afebrile, but no leukocytosis has been observed. Hemodynamic stability was maintained overnight after intubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient required non-invasive ventilation and subsequently intubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. It is believed that the patient may have Acinetobacter colonization, as there is improvement without treatment and no signs of infection. The patient experienced hypotension after intubation, which was managed with a bolus of normal saline and minimal use of vasopressor (Levophed). Steroids were tapered from 100mg IV q12 to 50mg IV q12. Tube feeds were stopped due to concerns of aspiration.

Allergies include vancomycin, exfoliative (Doctor's Last Name), linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The patient received antibiotics, specifically daptomycin and meropenem, on 9/8 and 9/11, respectively.

Infusions include fentanyl at 12.5 mcg/hour, midazolam (Versed) at 0.5 mg/hour, and heparin sodium at 1,300 units/hour. Other ICU medications include morphine sulfate, which was started on 9/10 at 8:00 AM, and furosemide (Lasix) given on 9/10 at 2:01 PM.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated
   yesterday for hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA,
   altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. With
   increase in respiratory rate, ABGs have demonstrated improved
   oxygenation.
   - now on 500/14/5/40%
   - Will attempt to go back down on rate, re-assess with repeat ABG later
   today.
   - Continue meropenem for klebseilla PNA, today is day 14 of 14.
   - Appreciate ID commenting on whether to cover patient for
   acinetobacter given respiratory decline.
   - Will need to continue to have discussions with family re: goals of
   care, as given need for intubation for the 2nd time, may need to
   discuss other options such as tracheostomy.
   - Daily trial off sedation to assess mental status.
   Sepsis/PNA: Pleural fluid from [**9-7**] growing acinetobacter, sputum with
   klebseilla. Patient has remained afebrile, but of note he had been on
   standing Tylenol.  No leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable overnight
   after intubation period once levophed off.
   - Appreciate ID  input: will clarify treatment for acinetobacter,
   possible that it is colonization, but could be possible source for
   deterioration.
   - Maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to draining well, so will need
   to remain in place.
   - Scheduled nasal suctioning
   - Tube feeds noted to be suctioned out of ETT tube, so will attempt to
   place Dobhoff today, will likely will require PEG at time of vascular
   surgery
   - Continue meropenem for Klebsiella Day 1: [**2125-8-31**]. 14 day course
   finishes today
   - s/p stress dose steroids
   PVD/Necrotic foot: Today, noted to have dusky extremities, which were
   improved upon repeat examination. Pulses palpable, so less likely
   embolic given improvement. Could be secondary to pressors, but patient
   was only on levophed transiently. Likely also related to bad vascular
   disease.  Currently, plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold until
   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Hold standing Tylenol to better monitor fever curve, but for now will
   continue neurontin for pain control
may need to cut down or d/c if
   having difficulty assessing mental status.
   - vascular surgery recs on whether candidate for surgery
   - trial of IV morphine for pain control
   Apnea: Likely was contributing to hypercarbic failure. Will need outpt
   sleep study and BiPAP at night if extubated.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out this week; no current
   EKG changes.
   -already on heparin gtt
   -continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   -hold BB given hypotension
   -on statin
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia. Being titrated up slowly on beta blocker as previously had
   some decrease in BP with increased metoprolol
   - Increased metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for improved rate control (home
   dose is 50mg PO TID)
as tolerated by BP, currently being held, will
   plan to re-intiated in AM after d/c stress steroids today and ensuring
   that BP remains stable.
   - Cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolving
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even to -500 cc
s neg.
   FEN: replete lytes prn
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
given concerns re:aspiration, will need to attempt to
   place dobhoff today (post-pylorus), and will need to discuss PEG with
   family
consider PEG placement (possibly at time of vascular surgery or
   tracheostomy).

   # Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]

   # Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be
   going for surgery and then hold another family meeting. [**Hospital 5524**] medical
   team can discuss patient
s medical clearance and risks/benefits. Family
   still very interested in pursuing surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a history of COPD, OSA, and altered mental status. He was admitted initially for a surgical wound infection and his hospital course was complicated by pneumonia and NSTEMI. The patient is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to suspected pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis/pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter and Klebsiella, and his respiratory status has shown improvement with increased oxygenation. He also has dusky extremities, which were improved upon repeat examination, and pulses are palpable. The patient's blood pressure remains stable, and his CVP is maintained between 7-10. He is on multiple medications, including meropenem, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and dextrose. His lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.8, Hct of 30.3, and platelets of 441. The patient's family is aware of the need for discussions about goals of care, including the possibility of tracheostomy if respiratory status does not improve. The patient's nutrition is poor, and there are plans to attempt placement of a Dobhoff"

   to remain in place for now, IP following
   - Dobhoff placed to help prevent aspiration. Will talk to family about
   PEG; chronic aspirator
   - Continue meropenem for Klebsiella Day 1: [**2125-8-31**]. 14 day course
   finishes today
   - Appreciate ID recs.
   PVD/Necrotic foot:   plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold until
   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Hold standing Tylenol to better monitor fever curve, but for now will
   continue neurontin for pain control
may need to cut down or d/c if
   having difficulty assessing mental status.
   - trial of IV morphine for pain control
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out this week; no current
   EKG changes.
   - on heparin gtt
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - hold BB given hypotension
   - on statin
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test, and patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure.
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
given concerns re:aspiration, will need to attempt to
   place dobhoff today (post-pylorus), and will need to
   - discuss PEG with family
consider PEG placement (possibly at time of
   vascular surgery or tracheostomy).
   Apnea: Likely was contributing to hypercarbic failure. Will need outpt
   sleep study and BiPAP at night if extubated.

   this week.
   # Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction. He was initially admitted for a surgical wound infection but developed hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated on 9/10. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and altered mental status. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a pressure support trial planned. The patient's sepsis/pneumonia is resolving, but he still requires bilateral pigtail catheters and a Dobhoff tube to prevent aspiration. There are plans to discuss tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with the family. The patient's necrotic foot is being managed with wound care, and plans for amputation and femoral-femoral bypass are on hold until the patient is more stable. His atrial fibrillation is being managed with metoprolol, and cardiology recommendations are pending for pre-operative clearance for peripheral vascular disease surgery. The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure, preserved ejection fraction, and poor nutritional status. An output sleep study and bipap therapy at night are being considered if the patient is extubated. The patient's code status is full code.

   1. Respiratory failure:  Hypercarbic, likely due to ongoing aspiration,
   underlying klebsiella pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and inability to keep
   up with his required minute ventilation.
   - attempt PSV today as he's more awake
   - continue meropenem for 14 day course for klebsiella (today 14/14)
   - diurese if bp will tolerate
   - discuss trach with family
   2. Shock:  Resolved.  BP now stable.
   3. PVD/necrotic foot:  Eventually needs AKA and fem-fem bypass.
   Vascular surgery following.  On heparin gtt.
   4. CAD/CHF:  On aspirin, plavix, statin.  Per Cardiology, will need
   persantine MIBI prior to surgery but not currently ready for surgery so
   will hold off on this.
   - restarted beta-blocker

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory distress.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA,
   altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds
   - now on PSV 40% 14/5, has been tolerating this since 2pm [**9-12**], RSBI
   127
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Will need to continue to have discussions with family re: goals of
   care, as given need for intubation for the 2nd time, may need to
   discuss other options such as tracheostomy and PEG
   - Daily trial off sedation to assess mental status.
   Sepsis/PNA: now resolving, Does not appear infected
    s/p 14 day treatment with meropenem for klebs PNA.
   Acinetobacter from pigtail likely contaminant.
   No leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable. afebrile
   - Maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to draining well, so will need
   to remain in place for now, IP following
   - Dobhoff placed to help prevent aspiration. Will talk to family about
   PEG; chronic aspirator
   - Continue meropenem for Klebsiella Day 1: [**2125-8-31**]. 14 day course
   finishes today
   - Appreciate ID recs.
   PVD/Necrotic foot:  plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold until
   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - neurontin for pain control
may need to cut down or d/c if having
   difficulty assessing mental status.
   - trial of IV morphine for pain control
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.  Ruled out this week; no current
   EKG changes.
   - on heparin gtt
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - hold BB given hypotension
   - on statin
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test, and patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure.
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
given concerns re:aspiration, will need to attempt to
   place dobhoff today (post-pylorus), and will need to
   - discuss PEG with family
consider PEG placement (possibly at time of
   vascular surgery or tracheostomy).
   Apnea: Likely was contributing to hypercarbic failure. Will need outpt
   sleep study and BiPAP at night if extubated.
   Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)
   Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting with
   daughter and wife earlier this week, will need to have another meeting
   this week.
   Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be
   going for surgery and then hold another family meeting. [**Hospital 5524**] medical
   team can discuss patient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems. He was initially admitted for a surgical wound infection and developed pneumonia, NSTEMI, and shock. He was transferred to the MICU and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is now on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has been tolerating this since 2pm yesterday. His respiratory system infection is resolving after a 14-day course of meropenem for klebsiella pneumonia. He has a history of COPD, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. There are plans for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) given the need for prolonged intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient may require extended periods of mechanical ventilation, which can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), lung injury, and muscle weakness.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of altered mental status, COPD, OSA, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, admitted initially with a surgical wound infection and later complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and transferred to the MICU with shock. The patient was intubated on 9/10 for hypercarbic respiratory failure, suspected to be secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. The patient has been tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 40% since 2pm on 9/12, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 127.

The patient has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumoniae and does not appear infected. However, the presence of Acinetobacter from pigtail catheters is likely a contaminant. The patient is hemodynamically stable and afebrile.

The patient's goals of care need to be discussed with the family, including the need for intubation for the second time and the possibility of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's PNA and necrotic foot have improved, but plans for above-knee amputation (AKA) and femoral-femoral bypass are on hold until the patient is more stable. Vascular surgery is willing to take the patient to the operating room if cleared medically.

The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed with metoprolol for rate control, and cardiology recommendations regarding pre-operative clearance for peripheral vascular disease (PVD) surgery should be followed. The patient is also at high risk for high-risk vascular surgery and requires a persantine stress test prior to surgery.

The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) is due to total body fluid overload but hypotension has resolved. The patient's central line and arterial line placements are documented.

Nutrition is a concern as the patient has very poor nutritional status. A discussion about PEG placement is necessary, considering the patient's chronic aspiration and potential need for long-term enteral feeding.

The patient's code status is full code, and family meetings have been held with the wife and daughter. The next family meeting will involve vascular surgery input regarding the patient's surgical clearance and risks/benefits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure due to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.
2. Sepsis/PNA - initially present but now resolving.
3. Acinetobacter infection from pigtail catheters (likely contaminant).
4. Atrial fibrillation with some episodes of tachycardia.
5. Diastolic CHF due to total body fluid overload.
6. Poor nutritional status requiring enteral feeding support.
7. Necrotic foot with potential need for AKA.
8. Peripheral vascular disease requiring possible femoral-femoral bypass surgery.
9. Risk of high-risk vascular surgery.
10. Potential complications related to central line and arterial line placements.
11. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
12. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
13. Risk of stress ulcer bleeding."

","The patient is a 69-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient's medical history is significant for a previous episode of sepsis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

On the current admission, the patient was initially placed on a Dobhoff catheter for medication administration, but it became clogged and was replaced with a nasogastric tube (NGT). The patient received Versed boluses through the NGT, which resulted in periods of apnea. The patient was then transitioned back to pressure support (PS) of 10 cmH2O at a rate of 40%. 

The patient's allergies include vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The last dose of antibiotics administered was meropenem on [**2125-9-12**] at 12:00 PM. 

The patient is currently receiving several infusions, including fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour, midazolam (Versed) at 1 mg/hour, and heparin sodium at 1,300 units/hour. 

Other medications given include fentanyl on [**2125-9-13**] at 02:30 PM and midazolam (Versed) on [**2125-9-13**] at 02:40 PM.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA,
   altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds
   - now on PSV 40% 10/5, has been tolerating this since 2pm [**9-12**]
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Family meeting re: goals of care, as given need for intubation for
   the 2nd time, need to discuss other options such as tracheostomy and
   PEG
   Sepsis/PNA: now resolving, Does not appear infected
    s/p 14 day treatment with meropenem for klebs PNA.
   Acinetobacter from pigtail likely contaminant.
   No leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable. afebrile
   - Maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to draining well, so will need
   to remain in place for now, IP following
   - Dobhoff placed to help prevent aspiration. Will talk to family about
   PEG; chronic aspirator
   PVD/Necrotic foot: plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold until
   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - neurontin for pain control
may need to cut down or d/c if having
   difficulty assessing mental status.
   - heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - on BB
   - on statin
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test, and patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure.
   - heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds: dobhoff clogged, replaced with NG tube
   - discuss PEG with family
consider PEG placement (possibly at time of
   vascular surgery or tracheostomy).
   Apnea: Likely was contributing to hypercarbic failure. Will need outpt
   sleep study and BiPAP at night if extubated.
   Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)
   Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting with
   daughter and wife earlier this week, will need to have another meeting
   this week.
   Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be
   going for surgery and then hold another family meeting. [**Hospital 5524**] medical
   team can discuss patient
s medical clearance and risks/benefits.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted initially on 8-4 with a surgical wound infection and his hospital course was complicated by PNA and NSTEMI. He was transferred to the MICU with shock and intubated on 9-10 for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of COPD, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.

The patient has been treated with a 14-day course of meropenem for klebsiella pneumonia and is now resolving. He does not appear to be infected at this time. The bilateral pigtail catheters are in place to drain well and will need to remain for now. The patient has a dobbhoff placed to prevent aspiration.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), blood pressure of 109/54 mmHg, heart rate of 94 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. His CVP is 9 mmHg, total fluid input is 742 mL, and total fluid output is 1,590 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 848 mL.

   CXR [**9-14**]: No new consolidations; unchanged pleural effusions
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA,
   altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds
   - PCo2 increased, pH decreased on PS 8, increased to 12
   - will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD hx
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Family meeting re: goals of care, as given need for intubation for
   the 2nd time, need to discuss other options such as tracheostomy and
   PEG
   Sepsis/PNA: now resolving, Does not appear infected
    s/p 14 day treatment with meropenem for klebs PNA.
   Acinetobacter from pigtail likely contaminant.
   No leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable. afebrile
   - Maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to draining well, so will need
   to remain in place for now, IP following
   - Dobhoff clogged, replaced with NGT
   PVD/Necrotic foot: plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold until
   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - neurontin for pain control
may need to cut down or d/c if having
   difficulty assessing mental status.
   - heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - on BB
   - on statin
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test, and patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure.
   - heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even
   - UOP trailed off this AM, small fluid bolus
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds: dobhoff clogged, replaced with NG tube
   - discuss PEG with family
consider PEG placement (possibly at time of
   vascular surgery or tracheostomy).
   Apnea: Likely was contributing to hypercarbic failure. Will need outpt
   sleep study and BiPAP at night if extubated.
   Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)
   Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting today
   Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be
   going for surgery and then hold another family meeting. [**Hospital 5524**] medical
   team can discuss patient
s medical clearance and risks/benefits.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA,
   altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds
   - PCo2 increased, pH decreased on PS 8, increased to 14, stabilized ABG
   - will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD hx
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Family meeting: plan for trach/PEG
   Sepsis/PNA: now resolving, Does not appear infected
    s/p 14 day treatment with meropenem for klebs PNA.
   Acinetobacter from pigtail likely contaminant.
   No leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable. afebrile
   - Maintain CVP =[**7-31**], MAP >65
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to draining well, so will need
   to remain in place for now, IP following
   - Dobhoff clogged, replaced with NGT
   PVD/Necrotic foot: plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold until
   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - neurontin for pain control
may need to cut down or d/c if having
   difficulty assessing mental status.
   - heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - fingers now appearing dusky, already on heparin, vascular following
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - on BB
   - on statin
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test, and patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure.
   - heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off, small fluid boluses prn
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - discuss PEG with family
wishes for PEG placement (possibly at time of
   vascular surgery or tracheostomy).

   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was admitted initially on [**8-4**] and has had a complicated hospital course. He was transferred to the MICU with shock and intubated on [**2125-9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is suspected to be secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.

The patient has been treated with a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, an infection caused by Acinetobacter was identified from a pigtail catheter, which is likely a contaminant. The patient does not appear to be currently infected as there is no leukocytosis, and he is hemodynamically stable and afebrile.

The patient's plan for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was discussed during a family meeting on [**9-14**]. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) should be maintained between 7-12 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be greater than 65 mmHg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-inch tall individual with a current temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 50 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 220 mmHg. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is 10.8 thousand cells/microliter, hematocrit (Hct) is 26.3%, platelet count (Plt) is 346 thousand cells/microliter, creatinine (Cr) is 0.4 mg/dL, total bilirubin (TCO2) is 35 micromolar, glucose level is 83 mg/dL, and lactate level is 0.6 mmol/L. The patient has a multi-lumen central venous catheter, arterial line, and is receiving various medications including midazolam, heparin, fentanyl, dextrose, and others. The patient's family wishes to pursue aggressive care, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Potential Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobilization and bed rest can increase the risk of blood clots in the legs, which may then travel to the lungs and cause a potentially life-threatening embolism.
3. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and pressure from the bed can lead to the development of pressure ulcers, which are open sores that can become infected.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient is in a hospital setting, where exposure to bacteria and other pathogens can increase the risk of developing infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is receiving medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anticoagulants, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Medication errors: With multiple medications and infusions, there is a risk of medication errors, including dosing errors or administering the wrong medication.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure readings indicate potential cardiac dysfunction or instability"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems including pvd and
   dry gangrene, admitted initially [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection,
   with hospital course complicated by PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to
   MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA,
   altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.  Current
   respiratory status most compromised by persistent aspiration.
   Ventilating well on PSV
   - PCo2 increased, pH decreased on PS 8, increased to 14, stabilized ABG
   - will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD hx
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - will discuss trach placement with surgery today
    - pig tail catheters in place continue to drain
    - nutrition was of great concern to family and will therefore continue
   tube feeds, will procede with surgical consult for peg although this
   will not remove aspiration risk
   2. PVD/Necrotic foot: AKA/Fem-[**Doctor Last Name 114**] bypass if pt medically stable, until
   then supportive measures
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - neurontin for pain control
may need to cut down or d/c if having
   difficulty assessing mental status.
   - heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - dusky appearing distal digits improving wth increased BPs
   3. CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - on BB
   - on statin
   - will procede with surgery once trach/peg in place without mibi, cont
   bb perioperatively
   4. Hypovolemia:
    - gentle bolus as needed for volume, maintain CVP 8-10
   5. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - heparin gtt
    6. Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid
   overloaded, but hypotension now resolved
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off, small fluid boluses prn
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - pt to have trach/peg placement, have consulted surgery
   Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)
   Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting [**9-14**]
   Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be
   going for surgery and then hold another family meeting. [**Hospital 5524**] medical
   team can discuss patient
s medical clearance and risks/benefits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and dry gangrene, admitted initially for a surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status is most compromised by persistent aspiration. The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, PVD with necrotic foot, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and poor nutritional status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. Persistent aspiration continues to compromise the patient's respiratory status.
2. PVD/Necrotic Foot: The patient has peripheral vascular disease with dry gangrene and foot necrosis. Bypass surgery may be considered if the patient is medically stable. Supportive measures will continue, including wound care and pain control.
3. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recently experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEM"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems including pvd and
   dry gangrene, admitted initially [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection,
   with hospital course complicated by PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to
   MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA,
   altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.  Current
   respiratory status most compromised by persistent aspiration.
   - PCo2 increased, pH decreased on PS 8, increased to 14, stabilized ABG
   - will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD hx
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - will discuss trach placement with surgery today
    - pig tail catheters in place continue to drain
    - nutrition was of great concern to family and will therefore continue
   tube feeds, will procede with surgical consult for peg although this
   will not remove aspiratin risk
   PVD/Necrotic foot: plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold until
   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - neurontin for pain control
may need to cut down or d/c if having
   difficulty assessing mental status.
   - heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - dusky appearing distal digits improving wth increased BPs
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - on BB
   - on statin
   - will procede with surgery once trach/peg in place without mibi, cont
   bb perioperatively
    Hypovolemia:
    - gentle bolus as needed for volume
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test, and patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure.
   - heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved
   -appreciate cardiology input
   -follow I+O's
   -I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off, small fluid boluses prn
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - discuss PEG with family
wishes for PEG placement (possibly at time of
   vascular surgery or tracheostomy).
   Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)
   Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting [**9-14**]
   Comm: [**Name (NI) **] discussion with wife and daughter at bedside, they would
   prefer to have family meetings by telephone as that allows them more
   privacy to deal with a tough emotional situation. Plan is to have
   vascular surgery give definitive input as to whether patient will be
   going for surgery and then hold another family meeting. [**Hospital 5524**] medical
   team can discuss patient
s medical clearance and risks/benefits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including peripheral vascular disease and dry gangrene. He was admitted initially for a surgical wound infection and had a hospital course complicated by pneumonia, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and later developed shock. He was transferred to the MICU where he became intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. His current respiratory status is most compromised by persistent aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further pulmonary infections due to his COPD, OSA, and the presence of an endotracheal tube.
2. Aspiration: The patient has a high risk of aspiration due to his altered mental status and OSA, which can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia and other respiratory complications.
3. Diabetic Foot Infection: The patient has peripheral vascular disease and dry gangrene, indicating poor circulation to the extremities. This increases the risk of infection and potential need for amputation.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient had a recent NSTEMI and has a history of coronary artery disease. He may be at risk for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems including pvd and
   dry gangrene, admitted initially [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection,
   with hospital course complicated by PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to
   MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA,
   altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.  Current
   respiratory status most compromised by persistent aspiration.
   - PCo2 increased, pH decreased on PS 8, increased to 14, stabilized ABG
   - will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD hx
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - will discuss trach placement with surgery today
    - pig tail catheters in place continue to drain
    - nutrition was of great concern to family and will therefore continue
   tube feeds, will procede with surgical consult for peg although this
   will not remove aspiratin risk

   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Cardiology following regarding recs on pre-op clearance for PVD
   surgery. Per cardiology, persantine stress test prior to vascular
   surgery, reconsult after stress test, and patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including peripheral vascular disease and dry gangrene. He was admitted initially on 8/4 with a surgical wound infection and has had a hospital course complicated by pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and shock. The patient was transferred to the MICU and intubated on 9/10 for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The respiratory status has been most compromised by persistent aspiration. 

The patient has undergone a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia and is planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to poor nutritional status. The family prefers to have family meetings by telephone. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (84-117 bpm), blood pressure of 96/45 mmHg (63-128/70 mmHg), respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (9-24 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm on electrocardiogram (ECG).

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.8 K/uL, hematocrit of 26.3%, platelet count of 346 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 35 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, glucose of 69 mg/dL, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) of pH 7.39, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 220. Imaging shows increased haziness in the lower lobes bilaterally with haziness at the diaphragmatic border.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. The patient's respiratory status remains compromised by persistent aspiration.

2. PVD/Necrotic Foot: Plans for above-knee amputation (AKA) and femoral-popliteal bypass are on hold until the patient is more stable. The vascular surgery team is willing to take the patient to the operating room if medically cleared.

3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had a recent NSTEMI and has a history of bare-metal stent (BMS) placement. The plan is to continue aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) therapy, beta-blockers, and statin therapy. The patient will proceed with surgery once the tracheostomy and PEG are in place without myocardial infarction imaging (MIBI), and continue beta-blockers perioperatively.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and dry gangrene, admitted initially for surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the patient was transferred to the MICU with shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and ventilated well on pressure support ventilation (PSV). There is persistent hypercarbia, likely due to aspiration.
- PVD/Necrotic foot: The patient has peripheral arterial disease and may require amputation below the knee (AKA/Femoral-popliteal bypass) if medically stable.
- Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient had a recent NSTEMI and has a history of bare metal stent (BMS). Medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blocker, and statin.
- Hypovolemia: The patient requires gentle fluid boluses for volume maintenance, aiming for a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-10.
- Atrial fibrillation: The patient has episodes of tachycardia and requires rate control with metoprolol.
- Diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient is diastolic, with preserved ejection fraction"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a history of COPD and OSA. He was admitted initially on 08-04 and transferred to the MICU with shock and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is stable on PS 14/5 40% and will try to decrease PS to 10. He is suspected to have a pulmonary infection, which has now resolved. The patient has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia. Bilateral pigtail catheters will remain in place for now, and plans for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are scheduled early next week. The patient's PVD/necrotic foot is being managed conservatively, and plans for amputation and femoral-femoral bypass are on hold until the patient is more stable. The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with metoprolol and heparin. Diastolic heart failure is also present, and fluid overload will be managed carefully. The patient's nutritional status is poor, and he will receive tube feeds through a nasogastric tube. A family meeting was held on 09-14, where the family preferred aggressive management, including tracheostomy and PEG."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a history of COPD, OSA, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted initially on 8/4 with surgical wound infection and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to intubation on 9/10. He was transferred to the MICU due to shock and remains intubated. The patient's condition has been complicated by NSTEMI, sepsis, and PNA, for which he received a 14-day course of meropenem. The patient is now stable on PS 14/5 40% and has resolved sepsis/PNA. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. The patient will continue to be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress or deterioration.

2. Sepsis/PNA: Although the patient's sepsis and PNA are currently resolving, there is a risk of recurrence if the source of infection is not fully addressed. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any signs of infection or deterioration.

3. Diastolic CHF: The patient has diastolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. There is a risk of fluid overload, which can"

   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA,
   altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds
   - Now stable on PS 14/5 40%
   - will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD hx
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Family meeting: plan for trach/PEG
   - Possibly still aspirating, although no residuals when checked
   Sepsis/PNA: now resolving, Does not appear infected
    s/p 14 day treatment with meropenem for klebs PNA.
   Acinetobacter from pigtail likely contaminant.
   No leukocytosis. Hemodynamically stable. afebrile

   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Continue wound care
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - neurontin for pain control
   - heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - fingers less dusky, already on heparin, vascular following, seemed to
   improve with SBP >90s after IVF bolus
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - Cardiology rec: persantine stress test prior to vascular surgery,
   reconsult after stress test, and patient is high risk for high risk
   procedure.
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a history of coronary artery disease. He was admitted initially on [**8-4**] and has had a complicated hospital course with the development of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which required intubation on [**9-10**]. The patient's respiratory failure is believed to be secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.

The patient has been treated for Klebsiella pneumoniae with a 14-day course of meropenem and has shown improvement, with no signs of infection currently present. He also had an Acinetobacter infection from a pigtail catheter, but this is believed to be a contaminant. The patient's sepsis/pneumonia is now resolving.

The patient has a history of necrotic foot and is being evaluated for possible amputation and femoral-popliteal bypass surgery. However, these plans are on hold until the patient is more stable. The patient's wound care will continue, and he is already on heparin for pain control.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with metoprolol, and he has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with a bare-metal stent (BMS"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. They are currently in the ICU and have a history of respiratory failure, aspiration, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, volume status, and mental status changes. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, and blood thinners. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they remain on mechanical ventilation. The patient's lab results indicate some abnormalities, such as low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows bilateral lung opacities suggestive of aspiration or atelectasis. The patient's nutritional status is being addressed with a pulmonary diet, and their glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, some potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of bilateral lung opacities indicate a risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's peripheral vascular disease and immobilization in the ICU put"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. They have a history of aspiration, and efforts are being made to improve sedation to reduce aspiration risk. The patient also has peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, volume status concerns, and mental status changes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobilization, further cardiac complications related to atrial fibrillation or coronary artery disease, and potential renal dysfunction from decreased urine output. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of their multiple comorbidities and potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, now planning for tracheostomy and
   PEG tube.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure, which was felt to be secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds (even
   with NGT in correct location).
   - Now stable on decreased PS to 10.
   - Will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD history, but mental
   status improved with CO2 in 50
s (versus 60
s-70
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked
   - Thoracics teamto do trach/peg today, appreciate assistance. They will
   communicate with family both before and after procedure. Held ASA and
   plavix today (as well as heparin gtt).
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to [**Last Name (LF) 1852**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will need to remain
   in place for now, IP following. Discussed with IP team, who plans to
   pull left sided catheter today (given there has been no infection there
   and left lung fully expanded).
   - PS after tracheostomy.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold
   until patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heparin gtt, since may have procedure

fingers not dusky at
   present, already on heparin, vascular following. Appearance of hands
   improves with SBP >90s after IVF bolus
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - Cardiology rec: persantine stress test prior to vascular surgery,
   call after stress test, and patient is high risk for high risk
   procedure.
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)

   - heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved

   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Reglan for aspiration risk to increase
   - Patient will get Trach and peg early next week

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted initially on 08/04 and has had a complicated hospital course. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with shock and intubated on 09/10 for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a pulmonary infection, previous history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.

The patient is currently planned for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. He has been stable on a decreased positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) to 10. The patient's mental status has improved with increased carbon dioxide levels. He completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia.

The patient's bilateral pigtail catheters will need to remain in place for now, and the left-sided catheter will be pulled today. The patient's plan for amputation below the knee (AKA) and femoral-popliteal bypass is on hold until the patient is more stable.

The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and necrotic foot. There are concerns about his atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior
   history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of
   tube feeds
   - Now stable on decreased PS to 10.
   - will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD hx
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating, although no residuals when checked
   - thoracics to do trach/peg early next week. Will f/u regarding if the
   need ASA/plavix held for procedure
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to [**Last Name (LF) 1852**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will need to remain
   in place for now, IP following. Will f/u with IP regarding pigtails,
   one is set to water seal, and then other to suction.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold until
   patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to
   take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - neurontin for pain control
   - heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - fingers less dusky, already on heparin, vascular following, seemed to
   improve with SBP >90s after IVF bolus
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - Cardiology rec: persantine stress test prior to vascular surgery,
   call after stress test, and patient is high risk for high risk
   procedure.
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Reglan for aspiration risk to increase
   - Patient will get Trach and peg early next week

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a recent NSTEMI.
- He was initially admitted for the surgical wound infection and later transferred to the MICU with shock and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has a history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.
- He has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia.
- The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and possible aspiration of tube feeds.
- He is currently stable on decreased positive end-expiratory pressure (PS) to 10.
- The patient is planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) early next week.
- Bilateral pigtail catheters are in place, and he is being followed by interventional radiology (IP).
- The patient's peripheral vascular disease and necrotic foot are being managed conservatively, with plans for amputation and femoral-popliteal bypass on hold until the patient is more stable.
- He has a history of coronary artery disease, including a recent NSTEMI and prior bare metal stent (BMS).
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with metoprolol and heparin gtt.
- He has diastolic congestive heart failure, preserved ejection fraction, and total body fluid overload.
- The patient's nutritional status is poor, and he is receiving tube feeds.
- Code status is full, and the family prefers aggressive management, including tracheostomy and PEG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to multiple factors, including pulmonary infection, COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and possible aspiration of tube feeds. There is a potential for recurrent respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and was treated with meropenem. There is a possibility of recurrent pneumonia due to aspiration risk and poor nutritional status.
3. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of CAD, including a recent NSTEMI and prior BMS. There is a potential for future cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has peripheral vascular disease with a necrotic foot. There is a potential for worsening peripheral ischemia and possible amputation.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with some episodes of tachycardia. There is a potential for cardiac complications, such as stroke or heart failure, if not adequately managed.
6. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, now planning for tracheostomy and
   PEG tube.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure, which was felt to be secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds (even
   with NGT in correct location).
   - Now stable on decreased PS to 10.
   - Will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD history, but mental
   status improved with CO2 in 50
s (versus 60
s-70
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked
   - Thoracics teamto do trach/peg today, appreciate assistance. They will
   communicate with family both before and after procedure. Held ASA and
   plavix today (as well as heparin gtt).
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to [**Last Name (LF) 1852**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will need to remain
   in place for now, IP following. Discussed with IP team, who plans to
   pull left sided catheter today (given there has been no infection there
   and left lung fully expanded).
   - PS after tracheostomy.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold
   until patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), holding this AM prior to OR.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - If patient more stable and planning for vascular surgery, will first,
   per cardiology recommendations, complete persantine stress, and call
   cardiology again after stress test, and patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure.
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated

   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Reglan for aspiration risk to increase

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure, which necessitated intubation. The patient also had a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.

The patient received a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia and is currently on decreased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10. The patient is scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement today.

The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a necrotic foot and is on hold for any amputation or femoral-femoral bypass procedures until the patient is more stable. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with metoprolol and heparin.

The patient also has diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with preserved ejection fraction and is being closely monitored for signs of ischemia in the extremities. The patient's blood glucose levels are being controlled with insulin sliding scale.

The patient's family has requested aggressive management and prefers tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient's code status is full code, and"

   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure. Suspect that his respiratory failure
   is secondary to pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior
   history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of
   tube feeds
   - Now stable on decreased PS to 10.
   - will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD hx
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating, although no residuals when checked
   - thoracics to do trach/peg early next week. Will f/u regarding if the
   need ASA/plavix held for procedure
   - Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to [**Last Name (LF) 1852**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will need to remain

   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as has
   BMS)
   - continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - Cardiology rec: persantine stress test prior to vascular surgery,
   call after stress test, and patient is high risk for high risk
   procedure.
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with afib with some episodes of
   tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a history of COPD. He was admitted initially for a surgical wound infection and later transferred to the MICU due to shock and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated since September 10th and is currently stable on a decreased pressure support of 10. He has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for klebsiella pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is suspected to be secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of COPD, altered mental status, and possible aspiration of tube feeds. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with a surgical wound infection and later developed pneumonia. His current condition shows improvement with decreased pressure support, but he still requires mechanical ventilation.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD may contribute to his respiratory failure, and there is a risk of COPD exacerbation due to potential aspiration and pulmonary infection.
3. Tracheostomy and Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG): The patient is planned for a tracheostomy and PEG procedure early next week. This surgical intervention carries its own risks, such as bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures.
4. Aspiration: The patient's altered mental status and poor nutritional status increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to further respiratory"

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted initially for surgical wound infection and had a hospital course complicated by PNA and NSTEMI. The patient was transferred to the MICU with shock and intubated on 9/10 for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is suspected to be secondary to pulmonary infection, prior history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. 

The patient is currently stable on decreased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 10 and will allow some degree of hypercarbia given the patient's COPD history. He completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient possibly still aspirates, although no residuals when checked. Thoracics have been placed for tracheostomy/peg tube early next week. 

Bilateral pigtail catheters continue to drain pleural effusions, and the patient will need to remain in place for now. The patient is also being followed up with interventional pulmonology (IP) regarding pigtail catheters, one set to water seal, and then the other to suction. 

The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and a necrotic foot. Plans"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure, which was felt to be secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds (even
   with NGT in correct location).
   - POD 1 from trach
   - Pressure support [**9-23**] and tolerating well
   - Will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD history, but mental
   status improved with CO2 in 50
s (versus 60
s-70
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked. PEG deferred for now.
   - IP removed L pigtail, R still in place. IP following.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold
   until patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - Continuing to monitor for signs of ischemia
fingers not dusky at
   present, already on heparin, vascular following. Appearance of hands
   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), restarted after trach.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - If patient more stable and planning for vascular surgery, will first,
   per cardiology recommendations, complete persantine stress, and call
   cardiology again after stress test (patient is high risk for high risk
   procedure).
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Reglan for aspiration risk to increase motility
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now (replace NGT
   today)
   Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems.
- Initial admission was for a surgical wound infection, which complicated with pneumonia, NSTEMI, and subsequently transferred to MICU.
- In the MICU, the patient experienced shock, intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, and now has a tracheostomy.
- The patient has a history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.
- The patient was on a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia.
- PEG was deferred due to poor nutritional status and skin breakdown.
- The patient's left pigtail catheter was removed, and the right pigtail catheter remains in place.
- Plans for amputation and fem-fem bypass are on hold until the patient is more stable.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a recent NSTEMI and a bare-metal stent.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is occasionally tachycardic.
- The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure with total body fluid overload but is now hypotensive.
- The patient's central line and arterial line were inserted on [**2125-9-6**].
- The patient's code status is full code, and family meetings have been held to discuss aggressive management and preferences.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure, which was felt to be secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds (even
   with NGT in correct location).
   - POD 1 from trach
   - Pressure support [**9-23**] and tolerating well
   - Will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD history, but mental
   status improved with CO2 in 50
s (versus 60
s-70
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked. PEG deferred for now.
   - IP removed L pigtail, R still in place. IP following.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold
   until patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - Continuing to monitor for signs of ischemia
fingers not dusky at
   present, already on heparin, vascular following. Appearance of hands
   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), restarted after trach.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - If patient more stable and planning for vascular surgery, will first,
   per cardiology recommendations, complete persantine stress, and call
   cardiology again after stress test (patient is high risk for high risk
   procedure).
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Reglan for aspiration risk to increase motility
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now (replace NGT
   today)
   Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, admitted initially on [**8-4**] with a surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the patient was transferred to the MICU with shock, intubated on [**2125-9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient now has a tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure/PNA, diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and potential vascular disease with necrotic foot. The patient's code status is full code, and the family prefers aggressive management, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient is on several medications including metoprolol, heparin gtt, fentanyl, midazolam, meropenem, aspirin, Plavix, and statin. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 92/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 37.4°C.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine level"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of exfoliative erythroderma, thrombocytopenia, and multiple comorbidities, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications and interventions. The most recent events include the removal of an intra-atrial pigtail catheter, placement of a tracheostomy, and a planned percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) that was deferred due to nutritional status and skin breakdown. The patient also attempted to self-discharge but was unsuccessful in removing the nasogastric tube. 

Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of low platelet count, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
2. Exfoliative erythroderma: The patient has a skin condition characterized by widespread redness and peeling of the skin. This could be associated with various underlying conditions and may increase the risk of infection.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient's heart rhythm is currently in AF, which can lead to irregular heartbeats and potential complications such as blood clots or stroke.
4. Septic shock: The patient's initial presentation may have involved septic shock, indicated by the need for vasopressor support and antibiotic therapy.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient requires respiratory support through a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation, suggesting respiratory failure or severe"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including a history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented with severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia and was initially stabilized. However, the patient's condition has deteriorated over the past few days.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 114 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 92/46 mmHg, and respiratory distress with an increased respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 34 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 0.6 mmol/L. Blood cultures have been drawn, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

The patient's fluid balance reveals a net intake of 1,838 mL and a net output of 977 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 861 mL. The patient's urine output"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA:  Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure, which was felt to be secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds (even
   with NGT in correct location).
   - POD 1 from trach
   - Pressure support [**9-23**] and tolerating well, trach mask trial today
   - Will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD history, but mental
   status improved with CO2 in 50
s (versus 60
s-70
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked. PEG deferred for now.
   - IP removed L pigtail, R still in place. IP following.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold
   until patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - Continuing to monitor for signs of ischemia
fingers not dusky at
   present, already on heparin, vascular following. Appearance of hands
   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), restarted after trach.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - If patient more stable and planning for vascular surgery, will first,
   per cardiology recommendations, complete persantine stress, and call
   cardiology again after stress test (patient is high risk for high risk
   procedure).
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Reglan for aspiration risk to increase motility held now for loose
   stools
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now (replace NGT
   today)
   Code: full (confirmed on admit to ICU)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was initially admitted on [**8-4**] and subsequently transferred to the MICU with shock and intubated on [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, placement of a pigtail catheter, and removal of the left pigtail catheter.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 114 beats per minute with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 92/46-63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. The patient is receiving several medications, including metoprolol, heparin, fentanyl, and midazolam.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 34,000/mm³, blood urea nitrogen of 116 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, glucose of 108 mg/dL, and elevated lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA: Patient intubated [**9-10**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory falilure, which was felt to be secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds (even
   with NGT in correct location)
   - POD 1 from trach
   - tolerated trach mask trial overnight, and will continue on this for
   now
   - aline removed today, will monitor VBG, [**Doctor Last Name **] if needed.
   - Will allow some degree of hypercarbia given COPD history, but mental
   status improved with CO2 in 50
s (versus 60
s-70
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. PEG deferred for now.
   - IP removed L pigtail, R still in place. IP following.
   ID: acinetomacter from pleural fluid in the past and GNR in pleural
   fluid from [**9-18**]. Will recheck pleural studies on fluid to check for
   infection. Has been treated for several pneumonias.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold
   until patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

fingers not dusky at
   present, already on heparin, vascular following. Appearance of hands
   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), restarted after trach.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - If patient more stable and planning for vascular surgery, previously
   cardiology recommended stress test. Will touch base with them again
   today to check if it will change management.
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Access: should get get PICC line today. Dc aline today and when gets
   Picc, dc central line
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Reglan for aspiration risk to increase motility held now for loose
   stools
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now (replace NGT
   today)

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, awaiting possible revascularization procedure for the
   left lower extremity.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:  Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory falilure, which was felt to
   be secondary to pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior
   history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of
   tube feeds (even with NGT in correct location).
   - POD 3 from trach
   - Tolerating trach mask
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked. PEG deferred for now.
   - IP removed L pigtail, R still in place. IP following.
   - R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed GNR
   (acinetobacter).  Unclear if colonization vs active infection, but
   fluid analysis profile is somewhat reassuring.
   - Passy-Muir valve evaluation
   - Suction as needed for secretions
   Bacteremia:  Blood cx from [**9-18**] now showing GPC in one bottle; WBC has
   been trending upward to 19 today, although pt afebrile.
   - Started Dapto (allergy to Vanc, hx MRSA)
   - Await speciation, sensitivities
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically. Now that pt
   clinical status appears to be improving, will ask Vascular to
   re-evaluate candidacy for surgery
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - Continuing to monitor for signs of ischemia
fingers not dusky at
   present, already on heparin, vascular following. Appearance of hands
   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), restarted after trach.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI (patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure).
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Hypothyroidism. Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs.
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds
   - Once on bolus feeds, can switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   - Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   Pseudomonas. Pt with indwelling foley and pseudomonas in culture UA
   with 11-20 WBC, [**11-8**] RBCs, neg nitrite .
   - No abx tx for now
   - Change out foley
   - Resend UA and urine cx
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a history of COPD and OSA. He was admitted initially for a surgical wound infection and has since developed complications such as PNA, NSTEMI, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated, and awaiting a possible revascularization procedure for the left lower extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural Effusions: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to pulmonary infection. There is also a possibility of ongoing pleural effusion with GNR bacteria present.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's blood culture from 9/18 showed GPC pairs/clusters, and the WBC count has been trending upward. This indicates a potential bacteremia, and appropriate antibiotics have been started.
3. PVD/Necrotic Foot: The patient has peripheral vascular disease and a necrotic foot. There are plans for an amputation and fem/fem bypass, but the patient's clinical status needs to improve first.
4. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a recent NSTEMI. He is currently on aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and a statin.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has episodes of tachycardia and requires"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:  Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory falilure, which was felt to
   be secondary to pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior
   history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of
   tube feeds (even with NGT in correct location).
   - POD 3 from trach
   - Tolerating trach mask
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked. PEG deferred for now.
   - IP removed L pigtail, R still in place. IP following.
   - R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed GNR
   (acinetobacter).  Unclear if colonization vs active infection.
   - Continue Daptomycin for now.
   Bacteremia:  Blood cx from [**9-18**] now showing GPC in one bottle; WBC has
   been trending upward to 19 today, although pt afebrile.
   - Started Dapto (allergy to Vanc)
   - Await speciation, sensitivities
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass on are hold
   until patient is more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - Continuing to monitor for signs of ischemia
fingers not dusky at
   present, already on heparin, vascular following. Appearance of hands
   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), restarted after trach.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - If patient more stable and planning for vascular surgery, will first,
   per cardiology recommendations, complete persantine stress, and call
   cardiology again after stress test (patient is high risk for high risk
   procedure).
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Hypothyroidism. Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs.
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds
   - Once on bolus feeds, can switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   - Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   Pseudomonas. Pt with indwelling foley and pseudomonas in culture UA
   with 11-20 WBC, [**11-8**] RBCs, neg nitrite .
   - No treatment for now.
   Access: central line, a line.
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, initially admitted with a surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, and now post-tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: The patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which was secondary to pulmonary infection. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds.
- Bacteremia: Blood culture from 9/18 showed GPC in one bottle, and the patient has been trending upward in white blood cell count. He is afebrile.
- PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for amputation and femoral-femoral bypass are on hold until the patient is more stable. The patient has an allergy to Vancomycin and is being treated with Daptomycin.

   effusion.
   3) Leukocytosis:  He has 1/4 bottles from [**9-18**] positive for GPCs.  At
   this point, it is not clear if this is a contaminant or pathogen.
   Given his worsening leukocytosis, will cover for GPC bacteremia until
   speciation returns.  REcheck blood cultures and check diff on WBC given
   past eosinophilia.  Recheck UA and urine culture.
   4) CAD:  Plan for perioperative beta-blockade
   5) PAD:  Will d/w vascular surgery on their plans for surgery.  His
   respiratory status is stable and there is no plan for further cardiac
   risk stratification.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, awaiting possible revascularization procedure for the
   left lower extremity.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:  Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory faillure, which was felt to
   be secondary to pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior
   history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of
   tube feeds (even with NGT in correct location).
   - POD 4 from trach
   - Tolerating trach mask
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked. PEG deferred for now.
   - IP removed L pigtail, R still in place. IP following.
   - R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed GNR
   (acinetobacter).  Unclear if colonization vs active infection, but
   fluid analysis profile is somewhat reassuring.
   - Passy-Muir valve evaluation
   - Suction as needed for secretions
   Bacteremia:  Blood cx from [**9-18**] now showing GPC in one bottle; WBC has
   been trending upward to 19 today, although pt afebrile.
   - Started Dapto (allergy to Vanc, hx MRSA)
   - Await speciation, sensitivities
   - New cx sent
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically. Now that pt
   clinical status appears to be improving, will ask Vascular to
   re-evaluate candidacy for surgery
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - Continuing to monitor for signs of ischemia
fingers not dusky at

   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   - Vascular re-evaluating for surgery
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), restarted after trach.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI (patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure).
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Hypothyroidism. Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs.
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds
   - Once on bolus feeds, can switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   - Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   Pseudomonas. Pt with indwelling foley and pseudomonas in culture UA

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, admitted initially on 8/4 with surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the patient was transferred to the MICU with shock, intubated on 9/10 for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now post-tracheostomy, awaiting possible revascularization procedure for the left lower extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: The patient may continue to have difficulty with weaning off mechanical ventilation due to underlying COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and possible aspiration of tube feeds.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's blood culture from 9/18 showed GPC in one bottle. He is afebrile, but the WBC count has been trending upward. He has started on Dapto (due to allergy to Vanc, history of MRSA) while awaiting speciation and sensitivities.
3. PVD/Necrotic foot: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may require surgical intervention, such as femoral-femoral bypass. However, the patient's clinical status needs to be optimized before proceeding with surgery.
4. CAD: The patient had a recent NSTEMI and has a history of bare metal stent (BMS) placement."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including COPD, OSA, and altered mental status. He was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection and subsequently developed pneumonia (PNA) and NSTEMI. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to shock and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. He underwent tracheostomy placement and is now awaiting a possible revascularization procedure for his left lower extremity.

The patient has been on a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia. There is a concern about ongoing aspiration, as the patient has a history of COPD, OSA, and altered mental status. The patient's pleural effusion fluid analysis showed GNR (Acinetobacter), but the current analysis profile is somewhat reassuring. The patient's blood culture from 9/18 now shows GPC in one bottle, with a trend of increasing white blood cell count.

The patient has necrotic tissue on his foot, and plans for amputation and fem-fem bypass were put on hold until the patient's clinical status improves. The patient is currently on heparin gtt for pain control and to prevent further ischemia in his fingers. The vascular team is re-evaluating the patient's candidacy for surgery.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and recent NSTEMI. He is currently on metoprolol, aspir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, uncomfortable sensation on the right side, and a dry ulcer on the left knee. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/61 mmHg to 143/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient is awake, alert, and responding appropriately to commands.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including infusion of heparin sodium, zyprexa for itching, and changes in the nasogastric tube and Foley catheter. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,886 mL with an output of 883 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,003 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask, and their ABG results indicate a pH of 7.31.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse bilateral breath sounds, an irregular heart rhythm, and stable extremities with minimal erythema around a dry ulcer on the left knee. Neurological examination shows that the patient wakes up and follows commands.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count ranging from 12.5 to 19.9 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 8.5 g/dL and 26.3 g/dL, platelet count between 294 and 332 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 88 mg/dL and 116 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab values such as creatinine, total CO2, amylase, lipase, and cardiac enzymes are also provided.

Radiology images are mentioned but not included in the progress note. The patient's code status and disposition are not specified.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of an indwelling catheter may increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased heart rate, or changes in respiratory status, is essential.

2. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PT/INR and PTT suggest a bleeding risk due to the anticoagulant therapy with heparin. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and prompt assessment of any signs of bleeding are necessary.

3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload. Appropriate fluid management is crucial to prevent complications like pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.

4. Respiratory issues: The patient's coarse bilateral breath sounds and the need for respiratory support indicate underlying respiratory problems. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, awaiting possible revascularization procedure for the
   left lower extremity.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:  Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory falilure, which was felt to
   be secondary to pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior
   history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of
   tube feeds (even with NGT in correct location).
   - POD 3 from trach
   - Tolerating trach mask
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked. PEG deferred for now.
   - IP removed L pigtail, R still in place. IP following.
   - R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed GNR
   (acinetobacter).  Unclear if colonization vs active infection, but
   fluid analysis profile is somewhat reassuring.
   - Passy-Muir valve evaluation
   - Suction as needed for secretions
   Bacteremia:  Blood cx from [**9-18**] now showing GPC in one bottle; WBC has
   been trending upward to 19 today, although pt afebrile.
   - Started Dapto (allergy to Vanc, hx MRSA)
   - Await speciation, sensitivities
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically. Now that pt
   clinical status appears to be improving, will ask Vascular to
   re-evaluate candidacy for surgery
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - Continuing to monitor for signs of ischemia
fingers not dusky at
   present, already on heparin, vascular following. Appearance of hands
   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), restarted after trach.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI (patient is high risk for high
   risk procedure).
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a history of COPD.
- He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration.
- The patient has been intubated and received a tracheostomy.
- He has been on a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumoniae and is now showing signs of improvement.
- The patient's blood culture from 9/18 shows GPC, indicating a possible new infection.
- He is awaiting a possible revascularization procedure for his left lower extremity.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and necrotic foot.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia multiple times during his hospital stay. This indicates a potential complication related to his respiratory system.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of GPC in the blood culture suggests bacteremia, which is a potential systemic infection.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but he still has total body fluid overload, indicating diastolic congestive heart failure.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has occasional episodes of tachycardia and is being treated with metoprolol for rate control.
5. Necrotic foot: The patient has a history of a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, awaiting possible revascularization procedure for the
   left lower extremity.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:  Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory faillure, which was felt to
   be secondary to pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior
   history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of
   tube feeds (even with NGT in correct location). now with trach [**9-18**]
   - Tolerating trach mask and PMV
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked. PEG deferred for now.
   - IP removed L pigtail, Rt removed [**9-22**].
   - R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed GNR
   (acinetobacter).  Unclear if colonization vs active infection, but
   fluid analysis profile is somewhat reassuring.
   - Suction as needed for secretions
   Bacteremia:  Blood cx from [**9-18**] now showing GPC in one bottle, which
   were coag negative staph. IJ tip cultured grew MRSA; WBC is now
   trending down
   - continue Dapto (allergy to Vanc) DAy 1: [**9-19**]
   - f.u cultures
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heparin gtt, since may have procedure
   - Continuing to monitor for signs of ischemia
fingers not dusky at
   present, already on heparin, vascular following. Appearance of hands
   improves with SBP >90s after IVF boluses.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, plavix (though does not strictly need plavix as
   has BMS), restarted after trach.
   - Continue metoprolol 25 TID,  statin
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 25mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal even
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. The patient was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection and later developed pneumonia (PNA), NSTEMI, and was transferred to the MICU for shock and intubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is currently awaiting a possible revascularization procedure for the left lower extremity.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure/PNA/pleural effusions, bacteremia, PVD/necrotic foot, CAD, atrial fibrillation, diastolic CHF, hypothyroidism, and poor nutritional status. The patient has been treated with various medications, including daptomycin for MRSA, meropenem for Klebsiella PNA, neurontin for pain control, and heparin gtt for possible procedure and anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds increases the risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to assess the patient's respiratory status.

2. Infection: The patient has a history of surgical wound infection, PNA, pleural effusions, bacteremia, and colonization with Acinetobacter"

   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, awaiting possible revascularization procedure for the
   left lower extremity.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:  Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory faillure, which was felt to
   be secondary to pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior
   history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of
   tube feeds (even with NGT in correct location). now with trach [**9-18**]

   [**9-19**]) today day [**4-26**].
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heprin gtt, since may have procedure
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 37.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
will titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.

   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs, Endocrine
   signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with tube
   feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection and developed PNA, NSTEMI, and was transferred to the MICU due to shock and intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has since undergone tracheostomy and is awaiting possible revascularization surgery for the left lower extremity.

The patient's current medical issues include hypercarbic respiratory failure, PNA, pleural effusions, mental status changes, potential aspiration, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt).

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, awaiting possible revascularization procedure for the
   left lower extremity.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:  Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory faillure, which was felt to
   be secondary to pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior
   history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of
   tube feeds (even with NGT in correct location). Now with trach [**9-18**]
   - Tolerating trach mask and PMV
   - IP removed L pigtail, Rt removed [**9-22**].
   - R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed
   acinetobacter.  likely colonization
   - s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   - Possibly still aspirating secretions. No tube feed residuals when
   checked. PEG deferred for now.
   - [**9-18**] Sputum culture positive for MRSA, initially on  Daptomycin (day
   1: [**9-19**]), switched to linezolid for better lung penetration
   - Diuresed, will re-eval need for further lasix
   -
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heprin gtt, since may have procedure; held given bleeding
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   -Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 37.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID)
 will likely increase to 50mg tomorrow so long as blood
   pressure tolerates diureses.
   - Heparin gtt
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotension now resolved.
   - follow I+O's
   - I/O goal -1L. positive yesterday, will give lasix today as long as
   blood pressure tolerates.
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs, Endocrine
   signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with tube
   feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including MS, ABG checked for hypercarbia, and suspected MRSA PNA. The patient has a history of allergies to vancomycin and linezolid, with a previous dose of daptomycin administered on 2125-9-23 at 12:00 PM. 

Overnight, the patient experienced BRB around the tracheostomy site, which could be related to epistaxis. Heparin gtt was stopped, and Hct was checked.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was initially admitted on 8/4 and has had a complicated hospital course. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to shock and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. He now has a tracheostomy and is awaiting a possible revascularization procedure for his left lower extremity.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, PNA, pleural effusions, necrotic foot, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and poor nutritional status. He has undergone several interventions, including a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia, switch from daptomycin to linezolid for MRSA infection, diuresis, and tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and ongoing respiratory support may indicate potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening respiratory distress.

2. Infection: The patient's history of multiple infections, including PNA and MRSA, suggests a risk for further infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) or hospital-ac"

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] with the ICU team, whose note above
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that he has more depressed
   mental status.  He had substantial epistaxis, followed by some
   hemoptysis. Continues to tolerate trach mask.  After consultation with
   ID, linezolid begun for probable MRSA PNA.   Today, we will (1) CT head
   to exclude hemorrhage; (2) CT chest to evaluate for loculated effusions
   and extension of PNA; (3) bronch from above and below tracheostomy to
   evaluate for source of bleeding.  Doubt tracheoinnominate fistula this
   early but reasonable to evaluate.
   Other issues as per the ICU team note.
   Time spent: 40 minutes

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including COPD, OSA, and altered mental status. He was admitted initially with a surgical wound infection and subsequently developed pneumonia (PNA), necrotic foot, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to shock and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. He now has a tracheostomy and is awaiting a possible revascularization procedure for his left lower extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had hypercarbic respiratory failure, which required intubation. Although he is now tolerating the tracheostomy and partial ventilatory support, there is still a risk of recurring respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has had multiple episodes of PNA, including colonization and infection with Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, and MRSA. There is a risk of developing further infections, especially with resistant organisms.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions, which may require drainage to relieve symptoms and prevent further complications.
4. Aspiration: The patient has a history of altered mental status and likely aspiration of tube feeds, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
5. Diastolic CHF: The patient has diastolic heart failure, and fluid overload is a concern. Close monitoring of I/O's and"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including COPD, OSA, and altered mental status. He was admitted initially on [**8-4**] with a surgical wound infection and subsequently developed pneumonia, necrotizing pneumonia in the right lower lobe, and pleural effusion. The patient also experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was transferred to the MICU with shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. He underwent a tracheostomy and is currently awaiting a possible revascularization procedure for the left lower extremity.

The patient's recent progress includes being on non-invasive ventilation, which was stopped on [**2125-9-24**] at 04:10 PM and replaced with invasive ventilation. His ABGs showed worsening, and he required an increase in antibiotics due to the presence of klebsiella pneumoniae in the pleural fluid. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and bronchoscopic evaluation and BAL cultures were performed on [**9-24**].

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Tmax: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
- Tcurrent: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
- HR: 96 bpm (normal range: 71-101 bpm)
- BP: 101/44 mmHg (normal range: 59-120/72-148 mmHg)
- RR: 17 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-31 breaths per minute)
- SpO2: 100% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's fluid balance shows an overall positive balance of 3,055 mL since admission, with a total input of 4,001 mL and a total output of 946 mL.

Laboratory results include:
- WBC: 11.3 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
- Hct: 22.2% (normal range: 36.1-46.1%)
- Plt: 306 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
- Cr: 0.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL)
- TCO2: 37 mmHg (normal range: 24-32 mmHg)
- Glucose: 110 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL)

Radiology findings include:
- CT Head: New opacification of mastoid air cells and left sphenoid sinus. No intracranial hemorrhage.
- CT Chest: Progressive pneumonia in the right lung, with likely necrotizing component in the right lower lobe. Superimposed interstitial pulmonary edema. Improved hydropneumothorax component of right pleural effusion. No significant change in large left pleural effusion except for slight increase in lateral component. Anasarca and a small amount of ascites. Bulky lymph node enlargement, possibly reactive, but follow-up CT in 3 months after discharge may be helpful to ensure resolution and to exclude a neoplastic etiology.

The patient's current medications include:
- Heparin Sodium: 1,400 units/hour
- Other ICU medications: not specified

   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, now with PNa and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:  Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory faillure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach [**Month/Year (2) **] until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.

   daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5862**])
   - patient bronch/BAL [**9-24**], will f/u cultures
   - Diuresed, but got volume yesterday in the setting of hypotension,
   will try to keep even today.
   - Non-contrast CT chest: RUL PNA, see above
   Epistaxis/blood from trach: resolved
   Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   - will check [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse for <21.
   Mental status: Noted to be sleepier this AM, likely secondary to
   hypercarbia, improving
   - Check Head CT: negative
   - Avoid sedating meds
   - treat hypercarbia with vent as needed.
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotensive yesterday.
   - I/O goal even today. positive yesterday, monitor blood pressure
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.

   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 37.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID): titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt restart cautiously
   Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs, Endocrine
   signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with tube
   feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was initially admitted on [**8-4**] and has had a complicated hospital course with various complications. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to pulmonary infection. He has undergone tracheostomy and is now back on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia multiple times, and the current CT chest shows a progressive infection in the right lung with a likely necrotizing component in the right lower lobe. There is also evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. It is important to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation while minimizing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has had pleural effusions, including right-sided pleural effusion with Klebsiella pneumoniae. This may require drainage and appropriate antibiotic treatment.

4. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, now with PNa and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory faillure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach [**Month/Year (2) **] until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.
   s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   IP removed L pigtail, Rt removed [**9-22**].
   R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed
   acinetobacter.  likely colonization
   - [**9-25**], patient hypercarbic in trach  [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] put back on pressure
   support. Rested him on PS overnight. Will try trach [**First Name3 (LF) **] again this AM.
   - Meropenem added because [**9-19**] pleural fluid growing klebsiella
   - Meroponem: (day 1 [**9-24**]) , Linezolid (day 1 [**9-23**], switched from
   daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5862**])
   - patient bronch/BAL [**9-24**], will f/u cultures
   - diuresed overnight, tolerated. Will make goal even to -500.
   - Non-contrast CT chest: RUL PNA, see above
   Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   - will check [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse for <21.
   Mental status: Noted to be sleepier on [**9-25**] secondary to hypercarbia,
   improving on pressure support
   - Check Head CT: negative
   - Avoid sedating meds
   - treat hypercarbia with vent as needed.
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotensive yesterday.
   - I/O goal even today. positive yesterday, monitor blood pressure
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heprin gtt, since may have procedure; held given bleeding, restart
   cautiously
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 37.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID): titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt restart cautiously
   Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs, Endocrine
   signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with tube
   feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems who was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and subsequent transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to shock and intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient underwent tracheostomy and was on ventilatory support until September 24th, when pressure support was reintroduced due to hypercarbic respiratory failure associated with right upper lobe pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, pleural effusion, anemia, mental status changes, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease with necrotic foot, coronary artery disease with prior stent placement, and atrial fibrillation. The patient also has hypothyroidism and poor nutritional status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure, progression of pneumonia, development of further pleural effusions, exacerbation of CHF, worsening anemia, deterioration in mental status, worsening peripheral vascular disease, cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina, and worsening of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored and addressed to prevent further complications related to malnutrition.

Overall, the patient requires careful management and coordination"

   Microbiology: [**9-24**]: BAL with gram negative rods
   not  yet speciated
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, now with PNa and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory faillure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach [**Month/Year (2) **] until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.
   s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   IP removed L pigtail, Rt removed [**9-22**].
   R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed
   acinetobacter.  likely colonization
   - [**9-25**], patient hypercarbic in trach  [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] put back on pressure
   support. Rested him on PS overnight. Will try trach [**First Name3 (LF) **] again this AM.
   - Meropenem added because [**9-19**] pleural fluid growing klebsiella
   - Meroponem: (day 1 [**9-24**]) , Linezolid (day 1 [**9-23**], switched from
   daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5862**])
   - patient bronch/BAL [**9-24**], will f/u cultures
   - diuresed overnight, tolerated. Will make goal even to -500.
   - Non-contrast CT chest: RUL PNA, see above
   Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   - will check [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse for <21.
   Mental status: Noted to be sleepier on [**9-25**] secondary to hypercarbia,
   improving on pressure support
   - Check Head CT: negative
   - Avoid sedating meds
   - treat hypercarbia with vent as needed.
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded,
   but hypotensive yesterday.
   - I/O goal even today. positive yesterday, monitor blood pressure
   - UOP does trail off or poor perfusion, small fluid boluses prn, but
   will monitor first as patient is very third spaced and at times urine
   output picks up on its own.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heprin gtt, since may have procedure; held given bleeding, restart
   cautiously
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5 TID
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol to 37.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is
   50mg PO TID): titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt restart cautiously
   Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs, Endocrine
   signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with tube
   feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), NSTEMI, COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. The patient was initially admitted on [**8-4**] and has had a complicated hospital course.

The patient was transferred to the MICU with shock, intubated on [**2125-9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, and now has a tracheostomy. The patient is currently being treated for hypercarbic respiratory failure, PNA, and a right upper lobe pleural effusion.

The patient has received a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia. The pleural fluid grew Acinetobacter, but this is likely colonization. The patient's tracheostomy tube was temporarily removed on [**9-22**] and the pleural fluid showed GPC with pH >8. 

The patient's recent blood cultures grew gram-negative rods, which have not yet been speciated. The patient's blood work shows leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient's current goals include improving respiratory status, managing pleural effusion, and addressing fluid overload. The patient's family has requested aggressive management, including tracheostomy and percut"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems. The patient was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection and had a hospital course complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to shock and intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. 

The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, and removal of intra-pleural (IP) drains. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, pleural effusions, and a recent diagnosis of right upper lobe pneumonia. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated eosinophil count, and evidence of renal impairment. The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating ongoing fluid loss. The patient also has a history of peripheral arterial disease and has been evaluated for possible amputation of the left foot due to necrotic tissue.

The patient's current medications include various antibiotics, anticoagulants, beta blockers, statins, and medications for pain control. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and glycemic control.

Overall, the patient's"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. He was admitted initially for a surgical wound infection and developed PNA, NSTEMI, and shock. The patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary infection and underwent tracheostomy. He has been on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with recurrent episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure. This could be due to his underlying COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and aspiration of tube feeds.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii complex infections. These infections may lead to worsening of respiratory symptoms and potentially spread to other organs.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of diastolic heart failure with fluid overload. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix is being utilized to manage this condition.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have been trending down, indicating anemia. Blood transfusions have been ordered to address this issue.
5. Eosinophilia: The patient has shown eosinophilia, which could be medication-related. This finding needs further investigation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted initially on [**8-4**] and has had a complicated hospital course with pulmonary infection, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and aspiration. The patient has been intubated multiple times, most recently on [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary infection. He underwent a tracheostomy on [**9-18**] and was on non-invasive ventilation until [**9-24**]. The patient's condition has been complicated by pleural effusions, eosinophilia, anemia, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with necrotic foot. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has had recurrent episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may require ongoing mechanical ventilation support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has had multiple episodes of pneumonia, including Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections. Antibiotic therapy may be necessary to treat these infections.
3. Diastolic CHF: The patient has diastolic CHF with fluid overload, and management with diuretics and fluid restriction may be required.

   Started on Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day 1: [**9-27**].
   - Meroponem for Klebsiella in pleural fluid: (day 1 [**9-24**]) , Linezolid
   (day 1 [**9-23**], switched from daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5862**])
   - on lasix drip all day yesterday, tolerated. Will make goal -500 to
   1L. Consider starting acetazolamide.
   - f/u VBGs q4-6 hours to assess hypercarbia
   Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded, on
   lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  putting out well with drip.
   - lasix gtt
   - will hold for alkalosis. Consider starting acetazolamide.
    Eosinophilia: 20% several days ago, now 18%.  Also has had
   intermittent rash. Most likely is medication related. reviewed history
   of hospitaization, was on steroids for some time which may have
   suppressed eosinophilia. Too high to be asthma related. Likely
   medication related.
   - f/u strongloydes
   - review medications again.
    PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control
   - Heprin gtt, since may have procedure; held given bleeding, restart
   cautiously
    CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - decrease metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.

   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    Mental status: improving with improvement in hypercapnea
    Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):

   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot is
   low prob. Negative ultrasound.
    Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with
   tube feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, admitted initially for a surgical wound infection.
- He has had a complicated hospital course including pneumonia, NSTEMI, and was transferred to the MICU with shock and intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration.
- The patient underwent tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia.
- He has had pleural effusions, with recent thoracentesis revealing basalar pneumothorax.
- Cultures have grown Klebsiella and Acinetobacter.
- The patient is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including Unasyn, meropenem, and linezolid.
- He is also being managed for anemia, diastolic congestive heart failure, eosinophilia, peripheral vascular disease/necrotic foot, coronary artery disease, mental status changes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and nutritional issues.
- The patient's family prefers aggressive management, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient developed a basalar pneumothorax following thoracentesis, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential need for further interventions such as chest tube placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, NSTEMI, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration and has since undergone tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of COPD, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. He is currently being treated for klebsiella pneumonia with meropenem and Acinetobacter with linezolid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of worsening hypercarbia. Frequent CXR and close monitoring of respiratory support are necessary.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient developed a basalar pneumothorax after thoracentesis. Frequent CXR and close monitoring are required. The pneumothorax needs to be managed appropriately.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion that requires ongoing monitoring. Thoracentesis may be repeated if necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has been trending down, indicating anemia. Blood transfusion may be required, and further evaluation of the cause of anemia is needed.
5. Diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has diastolic CHF, which is contributing to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, now with PNa and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.
   s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   IP removed L pigtail, Rt removed [**9-22**].
   R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed
   acinetobacter.  likely colonization
   - Thoracentesis on [**9-28**].5L removed. Patient has resultant basalar
   pneumothorax, on fio100%, getting frequent CXR. Effusion is transudate.
   - remained on PS 10/5 all day.
   - BAL from [**9-24**] grew Klebsiella (already on  [**Last Name (un) **]) and Acinetobacter.
   Started on Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day 1: [**9-27**].
   - Meroponem for Klebsiella in pleural fluid: (day 1 [**9-24**]) , Linezolid
   (day 1 [**9-23**], switched from daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5862**])
   - on lasix drip all day yesterday, tolerated. Will make goal -500 to
   1L. Consider starting acetazolamide.
   - f/u VBGs q4-6 hours to assess hypercarbia
   Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded, on
   lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  putting out well with drip.
   - lasix gtt
   - will hold for alkalosis. Will  start acetazolamide for 24 hr trial.
    Eosinophilia: 20% several days ago, now 18%.  Also has had
   intermittent rash. Most likely is medication related. reviewed history
   of hospitaization, was on steroids for some time which may have
   suppressed eosinophilia. Too high to be asthma related. Likely
   medication related.
   - review medications again.
    PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control - probably ineffective, will taper. Might
   be causing altered MS
   - Heprin gtt, since may have procedure; held given bleeding, restart
   cautiously
    CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - decrease metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    Mental status: improving with improvement in hypercapnea
    Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot is
   low prob. Negative ultrasound.
    Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with
   tube feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. He was initially admitted for a surgical wound infection and developed pneumonia, NSTEMI, and was transferred to the MICU with shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. He has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, thoracentesis, and removal of pleural catheter. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a history of RUL PNA. His pleural effusion is transudate, and he has been treated with various antibiotics for different infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition can lead to respiratory acidosis and may require adjustments in ventilator settings and oxygen delivery.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which can be associated with pneumonia or fluid overload. Further evaluation and management may be required to prevent or treat these effusions.
3. Eosinophilia and Intermittent Rash: The patient has an elevated eosinophil count and intermittent rash, which may be medication-related. Reviewing the patient's medication history and potentially changing medications may help resolve this issue.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has been trending down, indicating anemia. Blood"

   of hospitaization, was on steroids for some time which may have
   suppressed eosinophilia. Too high to be asthma related. Likely
   medication related.
   - f/u strongloydes
   - review medications again.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including COPD, OSA, and altered mental status. He was initially admitted for a surgical wound infection and developed PNA, NSTEMI, and shock. He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has had a tracheostomy and is now on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of COPD, OSA, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure/PNA/pleural effusions, anemia, diastolic CHF, eosinophilia, PVD/necrotic foot, CAD, mental status changes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and left arm swelling.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure/PNA/pleural effusions: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to recurrent pleural effusions and ongoing infection.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct has been trending down, indicating a need for further evaluation and management of anemia.
3. Diastolic CHF: The patient's fluid overload and diastolic dysfunction increase the risk of congestive heart failure exacerbation.
4. Eosinophilia: The patient's elevated eosinophil count and rash suggest a potential allergic reaction to medication, which needs to be investigated and managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He was initially admitted on 8-4 and later transferred to the MICU due to shock, intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and aspiration. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is now on mechanical ventilation. His current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, pleural effusions, anemia, diastolic congestive heart failure, eosinophilia, peripheral vascular disease/necrotic foot, coronary artery disease, mental status changes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and left greater than right arm swelling.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia multiple times during his hospital stay, and there is a possibility of recurrent or worsening infection.
3. Pleural Effusions: The presence of pleural effusions may lead to further complications such as infection or tension pneumothorax.
4. Anemia: The declining hemoglobin levels suggest ongoing blood loss or inadequate production, which can result in severe anemia requiring transfusions.
5. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic heart failure may worsen, leading to fluid overload"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, now with PNA and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.
   s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   IP removed L pigtail, Rt removed [**9-22**].
   R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed
   acinetobacter.  likely colonization
   - Thoracentesis on [**9-28**].5L removed. Patient has resultant basalar
   pneumothorax, on fio100%, getting frequent CXR.
   - remained on PS 5/5, will continue
   - BAL from [**9-24**] grew Klebsiella (already on [**Last Name (un) **]) and Acinetobacter.
   Started on Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day 1: [**9-27**].
   - Meroponem for Klebsiella in pleural fluid: (day 1 [**9-24**]) , Linezolid
   (day 1 [**9-23**], switched from daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5862**])
   - on lasix drip all day yesterday, tolerated. Will make goal -500 to
   1L. Starting acetazolamide. 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for worsening alkalosis.
   - f/u VBGs q4-6 hours to assess hypercarbia
   Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded, on
   lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  putting out well with drip.
   - lasix gtt
   - 2 more doses Diamox for alkalosis.
    Eosinophilia: 20% several days ago, now 23%.  Also has had
   intermittent rash. Most likely is medication related. reviewed history
   of hospitaization, was on steroids for some time which may have
   suppressed eosinophilia. Too high to be asthma related. Likely
   medication related.
   - f/u strongloydes
   - review medications again.
    PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, will titrate down to 200mg TID.
   - Heprin gtt restarted
    CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - decrease metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    Mental status: improving with improvement in hypercapnea
    Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot is
   low prob. Negative ultrasound.
    Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with
   tube feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now
   Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting [**9-14**]:
   want aggressive management currently. want trach and peg. Prefer

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with [initial diagnosis]. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including diuretics, antibiotics, and heparin drip. There have been changes in the patient's medical history, review of systems, vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results. The patient's condition seems to be improving, with resolution of pneumothorax seen on a repeat chest X-ray. However, there are some potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has been receiving diuretics and has a negative fluid balance, which can lead to dehydration and metabolic alkalosis.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, indicating an ongoing infection. The risk of antibiotic resistance or side effects should be considered.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the legs due to immobility and central venous catheters.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing pneumonia.
6. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged bed rest.

   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, now with PNA and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.
   s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   IP removed L pigtail, Rt removed [**9-22**].
   R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed
   acinetobacter.  likely colonization
   - Thoracentesis on [**9-28**].5L removed. Patient has resultant basalar
   pneumothorax, on fio100%, getting frequent CXR.
   - remained on PS 5/5 all day: trach mask today as tolerated
   - BAL from [**9-24**] grew Klebsiella (already on [**Last Name (un) **]) and Acinetobacter.
   Started on Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day 1: [**9-27**].
   - Meroponem for Klebsiella in pleural fluid: (day 1 [**9-24**]) , Linezolid
   (day 1 [**9-23**], switched from daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5862**])
   - on lasix drip all day yesterday, tolerated. Will make goal -500 to
   1L. Starting acetazolamide. 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for worsening alkalosis.
   - f/u VBGs q4-6 hours to assess hypercarbia
   Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded, on
   lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  putting out well with drip.
   - lasix gtt
   - will hold for alkalosis. Consider starting acetazolamide.
    Eosinophilia: 20% several days ago, now 18%.  Also has had
   intermittent rash. Most likely is medication related. reviewed history
   of hospitaization, was on steroids for some time which may have
   suppressed eosinophilia. Too high to be asthma related. Likely
   medication related.
   - f/u strongloydes
   - review medications again.
    PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, will titrate down to 200mg TID.
   - Heprin gtt restarted
    CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - decrease metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    Mental status: improving with improvement in hypercapnea
    Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot is
   low prob. Negative ultrasound.
    Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with
   tube feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

The patient has a history of COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. He is currently on a tracheostomy mask until [9-24], back on vent for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia.

The patient underwent thoracentesis on [9-28], removing 5L of pleural fluid. The pleural fluid grew Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, with the latter being previously sent fluid showing colonization. The patient was started on Unasyn to cover Acinetobacter and Meropenem for Klebsiella in the pleural fluid. Additionally, the patient is on a Lasix drip to manage fluid overload, which has been effective.

The patient's anemia has been trending down, and he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on [2125-9-24]. An order was placed for another unit of PRBCs on [9-28] due to a hematocrit (Hct) level of 19%, bumped appropriately to 26%.

The patient also has diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with preserved ejection fraction, resulting in total body fluid overload. He is being managed with Lasix and will continue to receive diuretics as needed.

Other medical conditions include eosinophilia, necrotic foot, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and atrial fibrillation. The patient's mental status has been improving with the improvement in hypercapnea.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, NSTEMI, and COPD. He was admitted to the ICU with shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, and now has a tracheostomy. The patient is still experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure due to right upper lobe pneumonia and has a basilar pneumothorax from a thoracentesis. He is on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem for klebsiella pneumonia and linezolid for acinetobacter colonization. The patient's Hct has been trending down, and he received 1 unit PRBs on 9/24 and ordered 1 unit PRBCs on 9/28. He also has a history of diastolic CHF, eosinophilia, PVD/necrotic foot, CAD, mental status changes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and left greater than right arm swelling.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience hypercarbic respiratory failure despite being on mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient developed a basilar pneumothorax after the thoracentesis. Frequent chest X-rays should be performed to monitor the extent of the pneumothorax and determine if further intervention"

   Microbiology: [**9-28**]: pleural fluid no grown
   [**9-24**]: acinetobacter and klebsiella
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, now with PNA and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.
   s/p 14 day course meropenem for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**])
   IP removed L pigtail, Rt removed [**9-22**].
   R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed
   acinetobacter.  likely colonization
   - Thoracentesis on [**9-28**].5L removed. Patient has resultant basalar
   pneumothorax, on fio100%, getting frequent CXR.
   - remained on PS 5/5, will continue
   - BAL from [**9-24**] grew Klebsiella (already on [**Last Name (un) **]) and Acinetobacter.
   Started on Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day 1: [**9-27**].
   - Meroponem for Klebsiella in pleural fluid: (day 1 [**9-24**]) , Linezolid
   (day 1 [**9-23**], switched from daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5862**])
   - on lasix drip all day yesterday, tolerated. Will make goal -500 to
   1L. Starting acetazolamide. 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for worsening alkalosis.
   - f/u VBGs q4-6 hours to assess hypercarbia
   Bleeding/Oozing:
   Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded, on
   lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  putting out well with drip.
   - lasix gtt
   - 2 more doses Diamox for alkalosis.
    Eosinophilia: 20% several days ago, now 23%.  Also has had
   intermittent rash. Most likely is medication related. reviewed history
   of hospitaization, was on steroids for some time which may have
   suppressed eosinophilia. Too high to be asthma related. Likely
   medication related.
   - f/u strongloydes
   - review medications again.
    PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, will titrate down to 200mg TID.
   - Heprin gtt restarted
    CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - decrease metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    Mental status: improving with improvement in hypercapnea
    Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot is
   low prob. Negative ultrasound.
    Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with
   tube feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and altered mental status. He was admitted initially on [**8-4**] and has had a complicated hospital course with shock, intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, tracheostomy, and multiple infections. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of right upper lobe pneumonia (RUL PNA) and pleural effusions. He underwent thoracentesis on [**9-28**] and developed a basal pneumothorax. The patient's blood cultures showed growth of Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, and he has been started on Unasyn to cover Acinetobacter and meropenem for Klebsiella. He also has anemia with a decreasing hematocrit (Hct) and has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on [**2125-9-24**] and ordered another unit on [**9-28**]. He is on lasix drip for fluid overload and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient also has eosinophilia and a medication-related rash, likely due to strongyloidiasis. He has"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male with many medical problems, admitted initially
   [**8-4**] with surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, now with PNA and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach back on vent for hypercarbic resp failure in setting of RUL
   PNA.
   R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8; previously sent fluid showed
   acinetobacter.  likely colonization
   - Thoracentesis on [**9-28**].5L removed. Patient has resultant basalar
   pneumothorax
   --on PS 15/5 all day - unable to wean because of worsening hypercarbia
   - Meroponem for Klebsiella in pleural fluid: (day 1 [**9-24**]) , Linezolid
   (day 1 [**9-23**], switched from daptomycin [**Date range (1) 5862**])
   - on lasix drip all day yesterday, tolerated. Will make goal -500 to
   1L. Acetazolamide. 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for worsening alkalosis.
   - f/u VBGs q4-6 hours to assess hypercarbia
   Anemia: Hct has been stable
   Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body fluid overloaded, on
   lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  putting out well with drip.
   - will hold for alkalosis. Consider starting acetazolamide.
    Eosinophilia: 23%  Also has had intermittent rash. Most likely is
   medication related. reviewed history of hospitaization, was on steroids
   for some time which may have suppressed eosinophilia. Too high to be
   asthma related. Likely medication related.
   - PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, will titrate down to 200mg TID.
    Continue to taper
    CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - decrease metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
    Mental status: stuporous, no response to stimulation on rounds
    Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
    Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   - Check TFTs next week
   Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot is
   low prob. Negative ultrasound.
    Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with
   tube feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. He was admitted initially on [**8-4**] and transferred to the MICU with shock, intubated on [**2125-9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is now on mechanical ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to right upper lobe (RUL) PNA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and OSA, and is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has R pleural fluid with GPC, pH >8, and previously had an acetabulum infection in the pleural fluid. This could potentially lead to recurrent or worsening pleural effusions.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure, with preserved ejection fraction. Total body fluid overload is present, and the patient is on a lasix drip to manage this.
4. Eosinophilia: The patient has a high eosin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, admitted initially with a surgical wound infection and a hospital course complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), shock, intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, and subsequent tracheostomy. The patient now presents with pneumonia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, pleural effusions, and a basilar pneumothorax. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with ongoing hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration leading to complete respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has recurrent pneumonia, which can be life-threatening if not effectively treated.
3. Pleural Effusions: The presence of pleural effusions can compromise lung expansion and function, potentially leading to further respiratory distress.
4. Pneumothorax: The basilar pneumothorax increases the risk of respiratory compromise and may require intervention such as chest tube placement.
5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate the possibility of DKA, which is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including tracheostomy, antibiotics for klebsiella pneumonia, linezolid for acinetobacter colonization, and continuous lasix drip for fluid management.

The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, pleural effusions, anemia, acute on chronic diastolic CHF, eosinophilia, PVD/necrotic foot, CAD, mental status changes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and left greater than right arm swelling.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, further development of pleural effusions, exacerbation of anemia, worsening of CHF, progression of PVD/necrotic foot, cardiac events, mental status deterioration, arrhythmias, and worsening of hypothyroidism.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation, respiratory status, fluid balance, electrolytes, and laboratory values. Regular assessments and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent and manage any potential complications."

   Imaging: Today's CXR Interval improvement in interstitial findings.
   Yest CXR: Tracheostomy is approximately 8 cm above the carina with
   slightly hyperinflated cuff. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
   stable. Extensive interstitial markings are unchanged compared to prior
   radiographs and most likely consistent with a combination of
   interstitial lung disease and edema.  Note is made that the left
   costophrenic angle was excluded from the field of view.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems including surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient was initially admitted for a surgical wound infection and developed complications such as hypercarbic respiratory failure, aspiration, and necrotic foot. 

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure due to a right upper lobe pneumonia, anemia, eosinophilia, and a history of atrial fibrillation. He also has a history of coronary artery disease with a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and prior placement of a bare metal stent. 

The patient has received various treatments including antibiotics for klebsiella pneumonia, linezolid for acinetobacter, and acetazolamide for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has also been given lasix to manage fluid overload and heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. 

The patient's family prefers aggressive management, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for nutrition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, worsening of heart failure, development of pressure ulcers, and possible infection due to prolonged use of medical devices such as the tracheostomy tube."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and a surgical wound infection. He was initially admitted with a right leg infection and developed pneumonia, NSTEMI, and subsequently required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to pulmonary infection. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, anemia, acute on chronic diastolic CHF, eosinophilia, necrotic foot, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and left greater than right arm swelling. The patient's family prefers aggressive management, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Regular surveillance cultures, elevation of the head of bed, daily awakening, and maintaining a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) below 50 will help prevent VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized, there is a risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be administered to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Due to the patient's critical illness and prolonged bed rest, stress ulcers may occur. Prophyl"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including COPD, OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds. He was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection and had a hospital course complicated by pneumonia (PNA), NSTEMI, and was transferred to the MICU with shock. The patient was intubated on 9/10 for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary infection and aspiration. He has since undergone a tracheostomy and is now on a tracheostomy mask until 9/24, after which he will be extubated. However, due to the development of a right upper lobe pneumonia and hypercarbic respiratory failure, he has been placed back on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been receiving a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia, and his pleural fluid has shown colonization with Acinetobacter. He was switched from daptomycin to linezolid on 9/23 and will continue to receive an 8-day course of Unasyn to cover Acinetobacter. His antibiotics were also discontinued on 9/24 for Klebsiella in the pleural fluid. The patient is being closely monitored with frequent chest X-rays and is receiving lasix gtt to manage fluid overload. His Hct has been trending down, and he received 1 unit PRBCs on 9/24, with another unit ordered on 9/28 for an Hct of 19. He is being transfused with blood instead of NS for bolus. His eosinophil count is elevated, and further evaluation for strongyloidiasis is pending.

The patient has a history of PVD and a necrotic foot, with plans for amputation on hold until he is more stable. Vascular surgery is unwilling to take him to surgery at this time. He is receiving neurontin for pain control and heparin gtt for oozing from the coccyx. The patient also has a history of NSTEMI and prior BMS placement. He will continue on aspirin, Plavix, and statin therapy. His metoprolol dose was decreased to 12.5 mg PO TID for rate control, and heparin gtt was discontinued due to oozing.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he is being treated with metoprolol and heparin. He also has hypothyroidism, which is being managed with IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, transitioning to PO once on bolus feeds. The patient has left greater than right arm swelling, which is thought to be related to the PICC line. An ultrasound was negative, and he is on heparin gtt prophylaxis.

The patient's nutritional status is poor, and he is being optimized with tube feeds and treatment of infections. A"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and previous surgical wound infection. He was admitted with pneumonia and NSTEMI and later transferred to the MICU for shock, intubation, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with various complications including acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, eosinophilia, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper adherence to ventilator care bundles, such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and monitoring respiratory system infection rates, should be implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued to prevent DVT formation.
3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation, are at an increased risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors should be continued to prevent the development of stress ulcers.
4. Glycemic control: Maintaining optimal blood glucose levels is crucial in"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and a previous surgical wound infection. He was initially admitted with a right leg surgical wound infection and developed pneumonia, NSTEMI, and shock. The patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. He has since undergone tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's recent medical interventions include receiving meropenem for klebsiella pneumonia, removal of pleural effusion with drainage of basilar pneumothorax, and initiation of linezolid therapy. The patient's HCT has been trending down, and he has received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is ordered for another unit. The patient is also being treated for acute on chronic diastolic CHF, eosinophilia (Strongyloides infection), PVD with necrotic foot, and recent NSTEMI. He is currently on aspirin, Plavix, and statin therapy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 109/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His physical examination findings include grimacing to touch, regular rhythm, clear to auscultation bilaterally"

He was initially admitted for a right leg surgical wound infection and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, leading to intubation. The patient has since undergone tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure due to right upper lobe pneumonia.

The patient's recent course includes a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia, removal of pigtail catheter from right pleural space, thoracentesis, and discovery of basilar pneumothorax. The patient's pleural fluid grew Acinetobacter, and he was switched from daptomycin to linezolid. Unasyn was started to cover Acinetobacter. Meropenem was discontinued due to the presence of Klebsiella in the pleural fluid.

The patient has also been diagnosed with anemia, with a decreasing hematocrit level. He received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on [2125-9-24] and is scheduled to receive another unit of PRBCs for a hematocrit level of 19%. The patient's total body fluid is overloaded, and he is being treated with lasix.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and previous NSTEMI. He was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection in the right leg, which later complicated by pneumonia (PNA) and another episode of NSTEMI. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to shock and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. He underwent tracheostomy and is now on a tracheostomy mask until September 24th, after which he will be placed back on a ventilator for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia.

The patient has received various antibiotics for different infections, including meropenem for klebsiella PNA and linezolid for Acinetobacter. He also has pleural effusions and a basilar pneumothorax from thoracentesis.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including anemia, acute on chronic diastolic CHF, eosinophilia, PVD with necrotic foot, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent NSTEMI. He is being managed with medications such as aspirin, Plavix, statin, metoprolol, and heparin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/56 mmHg to 120/65 mmH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, PVD, and previous surgical wound infection. He was initially admitted with a right leg surgical wound infection and developed complications including pneumonia, NSTEMI, shock, intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is now on a tracheostomy mask until September 24th, then back on ventilator support for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia. The patient completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia and an 8-day course of Unasyn to cover Acinetobacter. He is currently on pressure support and daptomycin for left knee cellulitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing hypercarbic respiratory failure despite being on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: Despite completing a course of meropenem, there is still a risk of recurrent or persistent pneumonia due to his immunocompromised state and underlying chronic lung disease (COPD).
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down, indicating anemia. He has received blood transfusions but continues to require additional units due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate production.
4. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart"

   tracheostomy, with PNA and continued hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions: Patient
   intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day
   1: [**9-27**]. for 8 day course
   - weaned to [**4-23**], try trach collar today
   -discontinued unasyn [**10-5**], completed 8 day course.
   - f/u sputum cx from [**10-3**]
    #Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26,
   2units [**10-4**].
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   # Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body
   fluid overloaded, on lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  lasix gtt as long as pressure tolerates.
   # Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Will treat with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days.  Avoid corticosteroids.
    # PVD/Necrotic foot: unchanged plan:
   All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on hold until patient
   more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] willing to take patient
   to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, will titrate down to 100mg TID.
   - Heprin gtt discontinue for oozing.
    #mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - decrease metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, with PNA and continued hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day
   1: [**9-27**]. for 8 day course.  Patient currently on [**4-23**] and doing well.
   Will attempt trach mask today.
   - Will also send sputum given fever this am.
   - Will send sputum cytology
    Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26,
   2units [**10-4**].
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body
   fluid overloaded, on lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  lasix gtt as long as pressure tolerates.
   Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Will treat with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days.  Avoid corticosteroids.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, continue 100mg TID.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for oozing.
   Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
   Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs, Endocrine
   signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
    -  TFTs today wnl
   Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot is
   low prob. Negative ultrasound.
   -consider ct venogram
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with tube
   feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now
   Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting [**9-14**]:
   want aggressive management currently. want trach and peg. Prefer
   Meeting over the phone.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems. He was admitted on [**8-4**] with a surgical wound infection and has had a hospital course complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), cellulitis in the left knee, altered mental status, eosinophilia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and upper extremity edema without evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition is improving, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include worsening of respiratory failure, progression of PNA, development of new infections such as Clostridium difficile colitis, worsening of cellulitis in the left knee, and complications related to PVD and upper extremity edema. Additionally, the patient's altered mental status should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems who was admitted with a surgical wound infection. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and subsequent transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to shock, intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and aspiration. The patient now presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, tracheostomy in place, and a diagnosis of Acinetobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other conditions include cellulitis in the left knee, altered mental status, eosinophilia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and upper extremity edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and has hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition requires immediate attention and management to ensure proper oxygenation.
2. Acinetobacter VAP: The patient has developed VAP, which is a serious infection commonly acquired during hospital stays or ICU admissions. It is important to complete the prescribed course of antibiotics to treat the infection effectively.
3. Cellulitis in the Left Knee: The patient has cellulitis in the left knee, which is a bacterial infection of the skin and tissues underneath. This condition needs prompt medical attention to prevent further complications.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be due to pain medications or other underlying"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of an unknown illness. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results are provided. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and medications. The vital signs and fluid balance are within normal limits, but there are some abnormalities in the laboratory results. The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, and there are elevated levels of D-dimer and lactic acid. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and supplemental oxygen. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.38, indicating a normal acid-base balance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, which may indicate a risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.
2. Infection: The elevated D-dimer level suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has an increased respiratory rate (RR), indicating potential respiratory distress or inadequate oxygenation.
4. Fluid imbalance: Although the total fluid balance is within normal limits, there may be a risk of fluid overload or dehydration due to ongoing fluid administration and losses.
5. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, which may require close monitoring and management to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and a history of myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the MICU with shock and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), cellulitis of the left knee, altered mental status, eosinophilia with positive Strongyloides antibody, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and upper extremity edema. He is currently receiving treatment for VAP, cellulitis, and PVD, and his glycemic control is being monitored. The patient has an arterial line and PICC line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to apnea episodes. It is important to monitor his ABG levels and ensure proper ventilation.
2. Acinetobacter VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter VAP, and a complete course of Unasyn has already been administered. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Cellulitis of the Left Knee: The patient has cellulitis in his left knee, and he is being treated with daptomycin. Regular monitoring of the wound and appropriate wound care should be provided.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, with PNA and continued hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day
   1: [**9-27**]. for 8 day course.  Patient currently on [**4-23**] and doing well.
   Will attempt trach mask today.
   - Will also send sputum given fever this am.
   - Will send sputum cytology
    Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26,
   2units [**10-4**].
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Total body
   fluid overloaded, on lasix gtt
   - I/O -.5-1 L.  lasix gtt as long as pressure tolerates.
   Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Will treat with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days.  Avoid corticosteroids.
   PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, continue 100mg TID.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for oozing.
   Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
   CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
   Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs, Endocrine
   signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
    -  TFTs today wnl
   Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot is
   low prob. Negative ultrasound.
   -consider ct venogram
   Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with tube
   feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now
   Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting [**9-14**]:
   want aggressive management currently. want trach and peg. Prefer
   Meeting over the phone.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, with PNA and continued hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day
   1: [**9-27**]. for 8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].
   - f/u sputum cx given fever this am.
   - f/u  sputum cytology
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26,
   2units [**10-4**].
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Will treat with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, continue 100mg TID.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for oozing.
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
   #Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   #Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot
   is low prob. Negative ultrasound.
   -consider ct venogram
   #Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with
   tube feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now
   #Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting [**9-14**]:
   want aggressive management currently. want trach and peg. Prefer
   Meeting over the phone.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a surgical wound infection in the right leg. The patient was initially admitted for pneumonia (PNA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to shock and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, anemia, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), eosinophilia due to Strongyloides infection, necrotic foot, altered mental status, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent NSTEMI and prior bare metal stent placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation and weaning difficulties due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and underlying COPD.
2. Further deterioration of renal function, as indicated by the trend of decreasing hemoglobin levels and ongoing blood product transfusions.
3. Development of additional infections, considering the patient's immunocompromised state due to eosinophilia from Strongyloides infection and prolonged hospital stay.
4. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or worsening heart failure due to underlying CAD and recent NSTEMI.
5. Poor wound healing and potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with team
   for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with the residents
   note, including assessment and plan.  In addition I would add/emphasize
   the following:
   75M w/ multiple medical problems, admitted [**8-4**] with surgical wound
   infection, with hospital course complicated by PNA, NSTEMI, who was
   transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**] for hypercarbic
   respiratory failure and aspiration.   Subsequently tracheostomy placed
   and now with PNA and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
   -tranch collar today. Limited by secretion output
   Acinetobacter VAP - complete course of unasyn
   -back on PSV for apnea episodes.
   Cellulitis; Lt knee
   -Cont dapto
   -Follow margins for improvement
   Altered mental status:
   -Improving, presumed sec to pain meds
   - Wean off as tol.
   Eosinophilia: persistent
 strongyloides Ab positive.  Check sputum for O+P and cytology.
   -          ID curbside recommended treatment for 2 days.
   -          Review meds
   -      Will review CT scans for evidence of malignancy, cortisol levels
   checked
   PVD
   -Cont antiplatelet agents.
   - Needs revascularization once medically stable.
   UE edema:
   - greater than LE but no facial swelling
   - no evidence of clots in bilateral Subclavian or  left upper
   extremity.
   CHF:
   - Continue lasix gtt  for diuresis. Will stop if limited by hypotension

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was admitted with a surgical wound infection and developed complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration and later underwent a tracheostomy. The patient has been diagnosed with Acinetobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and cellulitis in the left knee. He also has altered mental status, eosinophilia, positive Strongyloides antibodies, and possible peripheral vascular disease (PVD). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 108/48 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus rhythm, and his fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,697 mL with a total output of 2,995 mL. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and various medications through IV infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, a platelet count of 272 K/uL, a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and a glucose level of 87 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Amylase/Lipase, D-dimer, and LDH levels. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits. 

The assessment and plan include the continuation of treatment for hypercapnic respiratory failure, completion of the course of antibiotics for Acinetobacter VAP, and management of cellulitis in the left knee. The patient's altered mental status is improving, likely due to pain medication, and will be weaned off as tolerated. The eosinophilia is persistent, and Strongyloides antibodies are positive, so further evaluation for Ova and Parasites (O&P) and cytology is recommended. The patient's PVD requires continued antiplatelet agents and potential revascularization once stable. The patient's upper extremity edema is being monitored without evidence of clots in bilateral Subclavian or left upper extremity. The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) is being managed with lasix for diuresis. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) nutrition at 50 mL/hour. He has a PICC line and an arterial line in place. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP is also being provided."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including surgical wound infection, pneumonia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He was admitted with a surgical wound infection and developed pneumonia, NSTEMI, and subsequently required transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to shock and intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has undergone a tracheostomy and is currently being treated for Acinetobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), cellulitis in the left knee, altered mental status, eosinophilia, and strongyloidiasis.

24-hour events include sputum gram stain showing gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, and improvement in secretions. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/48 to 126/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's oxygen delivery device is a T-piece, and ventilator mode is CPAP/PSV with a tidal volume (VT) of 458 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 156 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 95%. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level is 9.8 g/dL, platelet count is 272 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level is 0.5 mg/dL, blood glucose level is 87 mg/dL, and lactate level is 0.6 mmol/L. The patient's D-dimer level is elevated at 881 ng/mL.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient continues to have hypercarbic respiratory failure and is being weaned off the ventilator. The Acinetobacter VAP treatment involves completing a course of ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn). The patient's cellulitis in the left knee is being treated with daptomycin for a 10-day course, and the wound needs to be followed for improvement. The patient's altered mental status is improving, likely due to pain medications, and will be weaned off as tolerated. The eosinophilia is persistent, and the patient tested positive for strongyloidiasis. The recommended treatment for two days has been initiated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems who was admitted with a surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with shock. He required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, and subsequently underwent tracheostomy placement.

The patient currently presents with hypercapnic respiratory failure and is being managed with tracheostomy, continuous nursing care, and noninvasive ventilation support. The plan includes continuing tracheostomy care, tolerating a trial of balloon down and Passy-Muir valve, and arranging for a speech consult.

The patient also has a diagnosis of Acinetobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) for which he completed a course of ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn). He will continue on daptomycin for a 10-day course, and the plan is to follow margins for improvement.

Additionally, the patient is being treated for cellulitis of the left knee, altered mental status presumed secondary to pain medications, eosinophilia with positive Strongyloides serology, and potential hypercoagulable state.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy, with PNA and continued hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter. Day
   1: [**9-27**]. for 8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].
   - f/u sputum cx given fever this am.
   - f/u  sputum cytology
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, received 1 unit PRBs [**2125-9-24**].
   ordered 1 unit PRBCs [**9-28**] for hct of 19, bumped appropriately to 26,
   2units [**10-4**].
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Will treat with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, continue 100mg TID.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for oozing.
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
   #Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   - IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds, Once on bolus feeds, can
   switch to 75 mcg PO daily
   #Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot
   is low prob. Negative ultrasound.
   -consider ct venogram
   #Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with
   tube feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now
   #Communication: Wife [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5578**]
 family meeting [**9-14**]:
   want aggressive management currently. want trach and peg. Prefer
   Meeting over the phone.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and a surgical wound infection in the right leg. He was initially admitted with a right leg surgical wound infection and developed complications including pneumonia (PNA), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and was transferred to the MICU with shock. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is now on a tracheostomy mask until September 24th, then back on mechanical ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia. The patient has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for klebsiella pneumonia and is now on Unasyn to cover acinetobacter until day 8. 

The patient has anemia with a declining hemoglobin level, and blood transfusions have been ordered. He also has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, previously treated with Lasix, which was discontinued due to metabolic alkalosis. The patient tested positive for strongyloides and will be treated with ivermectin. 

Regarding the patient's peripheral vascular disease and necrotic foot, plans for above-knee amputation (AKA) and femoral-femoral bypass have been put on hold until the patient is more stable. 

The patient's mental status has improved significantly, possibly due to the reduction of neurontin dosage and discontinuation of ultram. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a recent NSTEMI, and has a stent in place. He will continue on aspirin, Plavix, and a statin. Metoprolol will be continued at a dose of 12.5 mg PO TID, titrated up as tolerated. 

The patient also has atrial fibrillation and occasional episodes of tachycardia. Metoprolol will be used for rate control, starting at 12.5 mg PO TID and titrated up as tolerated. 

The patient has hypothyroidism and will receive IV levothyroxine while on continuous feeds and switch to 75 mcg PO daily once on bolus feeds. 

There is left greater than right arm swelling, likely related to the PICC line, which is on heparin. An ultrasound was negative, and a CT venogram is being considered. 

The patient's nutritional status is very poor, and efforts are being made to optimize it with tube feeds and treatment of infections. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is being considered as soon as possible. 

Finally, the patient's wife, who is also a healthcare proxy, prefers aggressive management, including a tracheostomy and PEG. A family meeting was held on September 14th to discuss the patient's care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a surgical wound infection in his right leg. He was initially admitted with pneumonia and a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's hospital course has been complicated by pulmonary infection, hypercarbic respiratory failure, shock, intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, tracheostomy, and continued hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, pleural effusions, anemia, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), eosinophilia, PVD/necrotic foot, mental status changes, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient continues to experience hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent complications such as hypoxemia, increased intracranial pressure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has ongoing pneumonia, which can progress and lead to worsening lung function, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Pleural effusions: The patient has developed pleural effusions, which if not properly managed, can lead to respiratory compromise and infection.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, now s/p
   tracheostomy on trach mask, with PNA and continued hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   #EKG changes: new RBBB, along with possible lateral elevations.
   Differential includes ACS vs PE.  Already on aspirin and plavix.  Will
   check cardiac enzymes and check echo for new wall motion abnormalities
   or RV dilation.
    #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].
   - f/u sputum cx given fever [**10-6**].
   - f/u  sputum cytology
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Clinically
   no signs of CHF.
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Will treat with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - Neurontin for pain control, continue 100mg TID.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
    #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    #Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   -levothyroxine PO
   #Lt>Rt arm swelling: likely related to PICC line, on heparin, so clot
   is low prob. Negative ultrasound.
   -consider ct venogram
   #Nutrition: very poor nutritional status. Will try to optimize with
   tube feeds and treatment of infections. Should ultimately get a PEG.
   - NGT, tube feeds
   - Consider PEG as soon as possible, but TF via NGT for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and admitted with a right leg surgical wound infection. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia (PNA), NSTEMI, and transferred to the MICU with shock and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on a trach mask with PNA and continued hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient has a decreasing Hct level, indicating anemia. This may contribute to acute heart failure in the setting of pre-existing diastolic dysfunction.

2. Eosinophilia: The patient tested positive for Strongyloides AB and will be treated with ivermectin. Eosinophilia can be associated with allergic reactions or parasitic infections.

3. PVD/Necrotic foot: The patient has peripheral vascular disease and a necrotic foot. Surgical intervention may be required, but the patient needs to be more stable before proceeding.

4. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status has improved recently, but there may be ongoing neurological issues that need to be addressed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   #EKG changes: new RBBB.  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs flat;
   continue asa/plavix
    #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].
   -          f/u sputum cx given fever [**10-6**]. - no clear infiltrate on
   cxr so treatment deferred at this time
   -          Retry to run slightly negative volume status wise aim
   -500cc/day
   Nutrition: Tube feeds; re-discuss PEG with family today. Video swallow
   today.
   Remainder of plan with limited change:
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Remains
   quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and hypoalbuminemia to
   the degree of decreased oncotic pressure
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
    #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - oxycodone for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
     #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    #Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   -levothyroxine PO

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), admitted initially for a right leg surgical wound infection. The patient's hospital course was complicated by pneumonia (PNA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and subsequently transferred to the MICU due to shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. 

The patient's current condition includes worsening ABGs, new right bundle branch block (RBBB) on ECG, flat CKs, troponin leak but no appreciable rise, no new findings on transthoracic echo (TTE), fair-low quality, no new wall motion abnormalities (WMA) or change in ejection fraction (EF), sputum cultures growing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. 

The patient is on various medications including heparin sodium, daptomycin, metoprolol, aspirin, Plavix, statin, lasix, oxycodone, and levothyroxine. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) at 36.8°C, current temperature (Tcurrent) at 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) at 96 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 123/62 mmHg to 132/98 mmHg"

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and a recent hospital course complicated by pneumonia, NSTEMI, shock, intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient was initially admitted for a right leg surgical wound infection. He was transferred to the MICU due to shock and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary infection. The patient's condition has improved, and he is now on a tracheostomy mask until September 24th. He will be placed back on ventilation for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia. The patient completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumoniae and switched to tracheostomy mask on October 6th.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia (PNA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with shock, intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient has been diagnosed with recurrent pneumonia, hypercapnic respiratory failure, and other various medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience respiratory failure, requiring continued tracheostomy and positive pressure ventilation (PMV).

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient had a previous episode of VAP caused by Acinetobacter and Stenotrophomonas species. It is important to monitor for any signs of recurrent VAP.

3. New Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB): The patient has developed a new RBBB on EKG, which requires further evaluation and follow-up.

4. Cellulitis of the Left Knee: The patient has cellulitis in the left knee, which requires continued antibiotic therapy and monitoring.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been altered, but it has improved in the morning. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

6. Eosinophilia and Strongyloides Infection: The patient has persistent eosinophilia and positive Strong"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical problems including a surgical wound infection, pneumonia, NSTEMI, shock, intubation for hypercapnic respiratory failure, and aspiration. The patient has been admitted to the MICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure and is now experiencing pneumonia. This increases the risk of developing VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient was initially admitted with aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia. This can further worsen the patient's respiratory status.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is currently showing signs of right bundle branch block (RBBB) on EKG. Close monitoring and management of the patient's cardiac status are essential to prevent further cardiac complications.
4. Strongyloides hyperinfection: The patient has tested positive for Strongyloides antibodies and has eosinophilia. This indicates the possibility of strongyloidiasis infection, which can cause severe complications if left untreated.
5. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis in the left knee. Proper management of the infection and wound care is crucial to prevent worsening of the condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   #EKG changes: new RBBB.  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs flat;
   continue asa/plavix
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].  Sputum from
   [**10-6**] with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella, ikely colonization.
   -continue trach mask
   #Nutrition: currently onTube feeds. Would like to place PEG so patient
   can receive more substantial nutrition.  Has failed several speech and
   swallow evaluations in the past.  Other option would be TPN, but would
   ideally utilize the gut.
   -GI recs
   #Cellulitis: minimal improvement on daptomycin.  Will add cipro.
   Remainder of plan with limited change:
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Remains
   quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and hypoalbuminemia to
   the degree of decreased oncotic pressure.  Will restart home dose of
   lasix.
   -lasix 40mg PO daily
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - oxycodone for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
    #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    #Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, PVD, and admitted for a right leg surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia, NSTEMI, and shock. The patient was transferred to the MICU and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. He has since improved on a tracheostomy mask and resolved ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumoniae and switched to tramadol for pain management.

The patient has failed several speech and swallow evaluations, so a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is recommended to provide more substantial nutrition. The patient's cellulitis has shown minimal improvement on daptomycin, so ciprofloxacin will be added. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down, and he will be transfused for a hemoglobin level less than 21. The patient's acute on chronic diastolic heart failure will be managed with Lasix 40mg PO daily. The patient tested positive for Strongyloides and was treated with ivermectin. The patient's peripheral vascular disease and necrotic foot will be evaluated for possible amputation or bypass surgery after he is more stable. The patient's mental status has improved, but he still requires ongoing monitoring. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including a recent NSTEMI and prior B"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   #EKG changes: new RBBB [**10-9**].  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs
   flat; continue asa/plavix
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].  Sputum from
   [**10-6**] with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella, ikely colonization.
   -continue trach mask
   #Nutrition: currently onTube feeds. Would like to place PEG so patient
   can receive substantial nutrition for a longer period of time.  Has
   failed several speech and swallow evaluations in the past.  GI is
   hesitatnt to place tube in setting of low albumin.  Patient will likely
   not be discharged to rehab given insurance coverage, urgency for PEG is
   diminished.  Will continue with tube feeds for now.
   -GI recs
   #Cellulitis: minimal improvement on daptomycin, added cipro [**10-10**] with
   more substantial improvement.  Will continue.
   #Pain Control: on oxycodone acetaminophen elixir, in addition to
   gabapentin.  Will add fentanyl patch, decrease neurontin.
   Remainder of plan with limited change:
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Remains
   quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and hypoalbuminemia to
   the degree of decreased oncotic pressure.  Will restart PO lasix [**10-10**].
   -lasix 40mg PO daily
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - oxycodone for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
    #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    #Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   -levothyroxine PO

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   #EKG changes: new RBBB.  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs flat;
   continue asa/plavix
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].  Sputum from
   [**10-6**] with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella, ikely colonization.
   -continue trach mask
   #Nutrition: currently onTube feeds. Would like to place PEG so patient
   can receive more substantial nutrition.  Has failed several speech and
   swallow evaluations in the past.  Other option would be TPN, but would
   ideally utilize the gut.
   -GI recs
   #Cellulitis: minimal improvement on daptomycin.  Will add cipro.
   Remainder of plan with limited change:
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Remains
   quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and hypoalbuminemia to
   the degree of decreased oncotic pressure.  Will restart home dose of
   lasix.
   -lasix 40mg PO daily
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - oxycodone for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
    #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    #Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   -levothyroxine PO

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and admitted initially with a right leg surgical wound infection. The hospital course has been complicated by PNA, NSTEMI, and shock, resulting in intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask and receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia. 

The patient has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia and an 8-day course of Unasyn to cover Acinetobacter. The recent sputum culture showed Stenotrophomonas and Klebsiella, which are likely colonization organisms. 

Nutritionally, the patient is currently on tube feeds and would like to place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) to receive more substantial nutrition. However, the patient has failed several speech and swallow evaluations in the past. Another option would be total parenteral nutrition (TPN), but the ideal approach would be to utilize the gut. 

The patient also has cellulitis with minimal improvement on daptomycin and will add ciprofloxacin. The remainder of the plan with limited change includes transfusing for anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, restarting home dose of Lasix for acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and monitoring for"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   #EKG changes: new RBBB [**10-9**].  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs
   flat; continue asa/plavix
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].  Sputum from
   [**10-6**] with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella, ikely colonization.
   -continue trach mask
   #Nutrition: currently onTube feeds. Would like to place PEG so patient
   can receive substantial nutrition for a longer period of time.  Has
   failed several speech and swallow evaluations in the past.  GI is
   hesitatnt to place tube in setting of low albumin.  Patient will likely
   not be discharged to rehab given insurance coverage, urgency for PEG is
   diminished.  Will continue with tube feeds for now.
   -GI recs
   #Cellulitis: minimal improvement on daptomycin, added cipro [**10-10**] with
   more substantial improvement.  Will continue.
   #Pain Control: on oxycodone acetaminophen elixir, in addition to
   gabapentin.  Will add fentanyl patch, decrease neurontin.
   Remainder of plan with limited change:
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Remains
   quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and hypoalbuminemia to
   the degree of decreased oncotic pressure.  Will restart PO lasix [**10-10**].
   -lasix 40mg PO daily
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - oxycodone for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
    #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   - required 2.5mg metoprolol intermittently for tachycardia while on
   lower dose PO metoprolol.
    #Hypothyroidism: Had been followed Endocrine, appreciate recs,
   Endocrine signing off, call with questions
   -levothyroxine PO

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has been intubated multiple times due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if the tracheostomy tube becomes blocked or dislodged.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia on multiple occasions. This increases the risk of developing further lung infections, particularly in the setting of prolonged intubation and immobility.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at increased risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Regular assessment and prophylaxis measures should be taken to prevent this complication.

4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low (572 K/uL), which increases the risk of bleeding. Any invasive procedures or surgeries should be performed with caution, and close monitoring for signs of bleeding is necessary.

5. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and CAD. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Ongoing cardiac monitoring and management are essential.

6. Wound Infection: The patient initially presented with a surgical wound infection in the right leg. There is a risk of further infection at the surgical site or development of new infections due to"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including COPD, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a history of surgical wound infection. The patient was initially admitted for a right leg surgical wound infection, which later complicated by pneumonia (PNA) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was transferred to the MICU with shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, and has since improved on a tracheostomy mask with resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's current assessment includes several potential medical complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural Effusions/COPD: The patient has been intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary infection, which has now resolved. However, the patient is still on a tracheostomy mask until September 24th and will be placed back on the ventilator for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia. The patient completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumoniae and switched to tracheostomy mask on October 6th.

2. Cellulitis: The patient has minimal improvement on daptomycin and was added with ciprofloxacin, showing more substantial improvement. The wound is expected to take time to resolve due to poor peripheral circulation.

3. Pain Control:"

   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   #EKG changes: new RBBB [**10-9**].  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs
   flat; continue asa/plavix
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].  Sputum from
   [**10-6**] with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella, ikely colonization.
   -continue trach mask, wean down oxygenation
   #Nutrition: currently onTube feeds. Would like to place PEG so patient
   can receive substantial nutrition for a longer period of time.  Has
   failed several speech and swallow evaluations in the past.  GI is
   hesitatnt to place tube in setting of low albumin.  Patient will likely
   not be discharged to rehab given insurance coverage, urgency for PEG is
   diminished.  Will continue with tube feeds for now.
   -GI recs
   #Cellulitis: minimal improvement on daptomycin, added cipro [**10-10**] with
   more substantial improvement.  Will continue.

   where patient had been scratching. Will continue with saran lotion and
   have wound nurse assess.:
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Upper
   extremities Remain quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and
   hypoalbuminemia to the degree of decreased oncotic pressure.  Will
   restart PO lasix [**10-10**].
   -lasix 40mg PO daily
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   Eosinophilia can take months to resolve.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to

   - oxycodone for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
    #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.

   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and previous admissions for surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and NSTEMI. He was initially admitted for a right leg surgical wound infection but developed complications including PNA, NSTEMI, and shock. The patient required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, but his condition improved while on a tracheostomy mask. He had an EKG showing new RBBB and completed a 14-day course of meropenem for Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient's sputum culture showed Stenotrophomonas and Klebsiella, likely colonization. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing tracheostomy mask weaning, evaluating for potential rehabilitation placement, and considering a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement due to poor nutritional status. The patient's cellulitis showed improvement with the addition of ciprofloxacin. Pain management recommendations include increasing gabapentin and considering methadone. 

The patient's skin breakdown is being treated with saran lotion, and there are plans to consult pain and palliative care for management of pain from contractures and discomfort from thirst and skin breakdown. The patient's anemia is being managed with blood transfusion for Hct <21. 

Additionally, the patient has acute on chronic diastolic CHF, eosinophilia from Strongyloides"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who has been admitted to the surgical service for an MRSA wound infection. The patient's initial course was complicated by respiratory arrest (likely pneumonia), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute renal failure (ARF), and necrotic left foot. He was initially on the floor and noted to be hypotensive with somnolence, so he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient was initially felt to be sepsis but without a clear source and was already on meropenem. He improved with fluid and did not require pressors. He had bilateral pleural effusions with pigtail catheters, right side growing Acinetobacter (ID thinks colonizer), left side sterile. The meropenem was stopped as it was completed 14 days for Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient was intubated on 09/10 for worsening mental status and worsening hypercarbia despite noninvasive ventilation, likely pulmonary edema with superimposed aspiration. He had a tracheostomy on 09/17 given the likelihood of continued aspiration. He was on TM (tracheostomy mask) for 5 days until 09/24 when he was in hypercapnic respiratory failure (back on vent). The patient is now receiving linezolid for MRSA pneumonia and meropen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease who has been admitted to the surgical service for an MRSA wound infection. The patient's course has been complicated by various medical conditions including respiratory arrest (likely pneumonia), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute renal failure, necrotic left foot, sepsis, bilateral pleural effusions with pigtail catheters, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation.

The patient is currently on linezolid for MRSA pneumonia and meropenem for klebsiella pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated due to the growth of Acinetobacter and Klebsiella in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient also has a new left knee cellulitis and is receiving daptomycin/ciprofloxacin for treatment.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. His respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy mask and 100% oxygen saturation. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's medical complications include heart failure, fever, respiratory failure, eosinophilia, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, pleural effusion, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient's nutritional status is poor, and he requires total parenteral nutrition"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions/COPD:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].  Sputum from
   [**10-6**] with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella, ikely colonization.
   -REPEAT CXR TODAY GIVEN INC SECRETIONS
   -continue trach mask, wean down oxygenation
   -suctioning q4h to prevent mucus plugging
   #Nutrition: currently onTube feeds. Would like to place PEG so patient
   can receive substantial nutrition for a longer period of time.  Has
   failed several speech and swallow evaluations in the past.  GI is
   hesitatnt to place tube in setting of low albumin.  Patient will likely
   not be discharged to rehab given insurance coverage, urgency for PEG is
   diminished. In addition, some rehab placement centers will accept
   patients on tube feeds.   Will continue with tube feeds for now.
   #Cellulitis: minimal improvement on daptomycin, added cipro [**10-10**] with
   more substantial improvement.  Will be slow to resolve given poor
   peripheral circulation.. Continue through [**10-20**] or until
   clearing/improvement
   #Pain Control: on oxycodone acetaminophen elixir, in addition to
   gabapentin.  Continue fentanyl patch
   #Skin Breakdown: Buttocks with erythemetous skin, area of bleeding from
   where patient had been scratching. Will continue with saran lotion and
   have wound nurse assess.:
   #Skin rash: on back/buttocks, apply topical cream, hydrocort for
   pruritic areas.
   #EKG changes: new RBBB [**10-9**].  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs
   flat; continue asa/plavix
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
    #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Upper
   extremities Remain quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and
   hypoalbuminemia to the degree of decreased oncotic pressure.
   - Holding lasix for now
   - goal 1L positive given exam and urine output
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   Eosinophilia can take months to resolve.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - oxycodone/acetominophen for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   #Hypothyroidism:
   -levothyroxine PO
   #Dispo: transfer to rehab once insurance issue resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions/COPD:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].  Sputum from
   [**10-6**] with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella, ikely colonization.
   -REPEAT CXR TODAY GIVEN INC SECRETIONS
   -continue trach mask, wean down oxygenation
   -suctioning q4h to prevent mucus plugging
   #Nutrition: currently onTube feeds. Would like to place PEG so patient
   can receive substantial nutrition for a longer period of time.  Has
   failed several speech and swallow evaluations in the past.  GI is
   hesitatnt to place tube in setting of low albumin.  Patient will likely
   not be discharged to rehab given insurance coverage, urgency for PEG is
   diminished. In addition, some rehab placement centers will accept
   patients on tube feeds.   Will continue with tube feeds for now.
   #Cellulitis: minimal improvement on daptomycin, added cipro [**10-10**] with
   more substantial improvement.  Will be slow to resolve given poor
   peripheral circulation.. Continue through [**10-20**] or until
   clearing/improvement
   #Pain Control: on oxycodone acetaminophen elixir, in addition to
   gabapentin.  Continue fentanyl patch
   #Skin Breakdown: Buttocks with erythemetous skin, area of bleeding from
   where patient had been scratching. Will continue with saran lotion and
   have wound nurse assess.:
   #Skin rash: on back/buttocks, apply topical cream, hydrocort for
   pruritic areas.
   #EKG changes: new RBBB [**10-9**].  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs
   flat; continue asa/plavix
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
    #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Upper
   extremities Remain quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and
   hypoalbuminemia to the degree of decreased oncotic pressure.
   - Holding lasix for now
    - goal 1L positive given exam and urine output
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   Eosinophilia can take months to resolve.
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - oxycodone/acetominophen for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   #Hypothyroidism:
   -levothyroxine PO
   #Dispo: transfer to rehab once insurance issue resolved.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and previous admissions for surgical wound infection, pneumonia, and NSTEMI. The patient was initially admitted with a right leg surgical wound infection and developed complications including PNA, NSTEMI, shock, intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, resolved VAP, and currently on tracheostomy with mechanical ventilation.

The patient has multiple medical issues that need to be addressed, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, COPD, pneumonia, cellulitis, pain control, skin breakdown, rash, EKG changes, anemia, acute on chronic diastolic CHF, eosinophilia, PVD/necrotic foot, mental status improvement, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and previous episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a high risk for recurrent respiratory failure, especially if there is an exacerbation of COPD or development of new lung infections.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has had multiple episodes of pneumonia during his hospital stay. There is a risk of further lung infections due to his compromised respiratory status and possible aspiration.
3. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis that has shown minimal improvement despite antibiotic treatment. This may indicate a resistant infection or inadequate treatment, which could lead to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions/COPD:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].  Sputum from
   [**10-6**] with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella, ikely colonization.
   -REPEAT CXR TODAY GIVEN INC SECRETIONS
   -continue trach mask, wean down oxygenation
   -suctioning q4h to prevent mucus plugging
   #Nutrition: currently onTube feeds. Would like to place PEG so patient
   can receive substantial nutrition for a longer period of time.  Has
   failed several speech and swallow evaluations in the past.  GI is
   hesitatnt to place tube in setting of low albumin.  Patient will likely
   not be discharged to rehab given insurance coverage, urgency for PEG is
   diminished. In addition, some rehab placement centers will accept
   patients on tube feeds.   Will continue with tube feeds for now.
   - Will talk to IR regarding PEG placement
   #Cellulitis: minimal improvement on daptomycin, added cipro [**10-10**] with
   more substantial improvement.  Will be slow to resolve given poor
   peripheral circulation.. Continue through [**10-20**] or until
   clearing/improvement
   #Pain Control: on oxycodone acetaminophen elixir, in addition to
   gabapentin.  Continue fentanyl patch
   #Skin Breakdown: Buttocks with erythemetous skin, area of bleeding from
   where patient had been scratching. Will continue with saran lotion and
   have wound nurse assess.:
   #Skin rash: on back/buttocks, apply topical cream, hydrocort for
   pruritic areas.
   #EKG changes: RBBB [**10-9**].  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs
   flat; continue asa/plavix
   # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
    #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Upper
   extremities Remain quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and
   hypoalbuminemia to the degree of decreased oncotic pressure.
   - Holding lasix for now
    - goal 1L positive given exam and urine output
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   Eosinophilia can take months to resolve.
   - Heme Onc consulted on [**2125-10-15**]
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - oxycodone/acetominophen for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   #Hypothyroidism:
   -levothyroxine PO
   #Dispo: transfer to rehab once insurance issue resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, PVD, and admitted initially for a surgical wound infection in the right leg. The hospital course has been complicated by pneumonia, NSTEMI, and the patient was transferred to the MICU with shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure/PNA/pleural effusions/COPD, cellulitis, pain control, skin breakdown, rash, EKG changes, anemia, acute on chronic diastolic CHF, eosinophilia, PVD/necrotic foot, mental status improvement, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD and recent aspiration make him prone to developing pneumonia.
2. Diabetic Foot Ulcer: The presence of a necrotic foot indicates a potential complication related to peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and possible diabetic foot ulcer.
3. Skin Breakdown: The patient has developed pressure ulcers on his buttocks, which can lead to infection and worsen his overall condition.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregular heartbeat increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolism.
5. Hypothyroidism: Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to various complications, including cardiac issues and mental health problems.

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, PVD, and multiple comorbidities. He was initially admitted with a surgical wound infection in the right leg, which was complicated by pneumonia and NSTEMI. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to shock and intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. He has since improved and is now on a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, pleural effusions, cellulitis, pain control, skin breakdown, rash, EKG changes, anemia, acute on chronic diastolic CHF, eosinophilia, PVD/necrotic foot, mental status changes, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure increases the risk of respiratory failure. Monitoring oxygenation and ventilatory support may be necessary.

2. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including pneumonia, cellulitis, and possible colonization with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies will be essential to identify any worsening infection.

3. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and CAD. Continued monitoring of cardiac enzymes and EKG changes will be important. Optimization of fluid status"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 75 year old male w/ pmh COPD, PVD, admitted initially [**8-4**] with
   right leg surgical wound infection, with hospital course complicated by
   PNA, NSTEMI, who was transferred to MICU with shock, intubated [**2125-9-10**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration, improved on trach
   mask with resolving VAP.
   #Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/PNA/Pleural effusions/COPD:
   Patient intubated [**9-10**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
   pulmonary infection (which has now resolved), prior history of COPD,
   OSA, altered mental status, and likely aspiration of tube feeds, Now
   with trach [**9-18**], on trach mask until [**9-24**], back on vent for hypercarbic
   resp failure in setting of RUL PNA.  Completed 14 day course meropenem
   for klebseilla PNA ([**Date range (1) 5586**]). Unasyn to cover acinetobacter.
   completed  8 day course.  Switched to trach mask [**10-6**].  Sputum from
   [**10-6**] with stenotrophomonas and klebsiella, ikely colonization.
   -continue trach mask, wean down oxygenation
   -suctioning q4h to prevent mucus plugging
   #Nutrition: currently onTube feeds. Would like to place PEG so patient
   can receive substantial nutrition for a longer period of time.  Has
   failed several speech and swallow evaluations in the past.  GI is
   hesitatnt to place tube in setting of low albumin.  .   Will continue
   with tube feeds for now.
   - Will talk to IR regarding PEG placement
   #Cellulitis: minimal improvement on daptomycin, added cipro [**10-10**] with
   more substantial improvement.  Will be slow to resolve given poor
   peripheral circulation.. Continue through [**10-20**] or until
   clearing/improvement
   #Pain Control: on oxycodone acetaminophen elixir, in addition to
   gabapentin.  Will Continue fentanyl patch. Pain improved [**10-16**]
   #Skin Breakdown: Buttocks with erythemetous skin, area of bleeding from
   where patient had been scratching. Will continue with saran lotion and
   have wound nurse assess.:
   #Skin rash: on back/buttocks, apply topical cream, hydrocort for
   pruritic areas.
   #EKG changes: RBBB [**10-9**].  No new echo findiings, trop leak but CKs
   flat; continue asa/plavix
    # Anemia: Hct has been trending down, not hemolyzing.
   - transfuse for <21. Blood instead of NS for bolus
   #Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Diastolic, preserved EF. Was on lasix
   gtt, discontinued [**10-7**] secondary to metabolic alkalosis.  Upper
   extremities Remain quite anasarcic but mostly with dependent edema and
   hypoalbuminemia to the degree of decreased oncotic pressure.
   - Holding lasix for now
   #Eosinophilia: Strongyloides AB positive. Treated with ivermectin,
   200ucg/kg daily x two days. Completed [**10-6**]. Avoid corticosteroids.
   Eosinophilia can take months to resolve.
   - Heme Onc consulted on [**2125-10-15**]
   #PVD/Necrotic foot: All plans for AKA and fem/fem bypass had been on
   hold until patient more stable. Per vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   willing to take patient to OR if cleared medically.  Patient will go to
   rehab first be considered for surgery upon return.
   - Vascular will not take him to surgery currently
   - oxycodone/acetominophen for pain breakthrough.
   - Heparin gtt discontinued for coccygeal oozing.  - still oozing as of
   yesterday [**10-8**]
   #Mental status: much improved on [**10-5**], opening eyes, trying to
   communicate. Possibly from lowering neurontin dose and discontinuing
   ultram.
   #CAD: s/p recent NSTEMI. Has prior BMS.
   - Will continue aspirin, Plavix, statin
   - Continue metoprolol to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <95.
   - Cards rec peri-operative beta blockade and optimization of fluid
   status prior to OR, no need for MIBI as will not change management
   (patient is high risk for high risk procedure)
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with atrial fibrillation, occasional
   episodes of tachycardia.
   - Metoprolol 12.5mg PO TID for rate control (home dose is 50mg PO TID):
   titrate up as tolerated
   - Heparin gtt
 discontinue for oozing from coccyx
   #Hypothyroidism:
   -levothyroxine PO
   #Dispo: transfer to rehab once insurance issue resolved.

He was initially admitted with a right leg surgical wound infection and developed pneumonia, NSTEMI, and subsequently transferred to the MICU for shock, intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and right upper lobe pneumonia, cellulitis with minimal improvement on daptomycin, pain control issues, skin breakdown and rash, anemia, acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, eosinophilia, peripheral vascular disease/necrotic foot, and mental status improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.
2. Progression of cellulitis if not adequately treated.
3. Development of pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.
4. Thrombocytopenia, which could be caused by sepsis or other factors.
5. Further deterioration in renal function, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
6. Complications related to atrial fibrillation, such as stroke or heart failure.
7. Potential for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulant therapy.
8. Complications related to peripheral vascular disease, such as acute limb ischemia or gangrene.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of PVD with critical limb ischemia, cellulitis, heart failure (diastolic), acute on chronic, pain control, anemia, airway inability to protect, leukocytosis/eosinophilia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), ineffective coping, knowledge deficit, impaired skin integrity, and PVD without critical limb ischemia. The patient's medical team plans to place a feeding tube this week and initiate rehab at the end of the week or next week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PVD with Critical Limb Ischemia: The patient has peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, which means there is reduced blood flow to the limbs. This condition can lead to tissue damage and potentially amputation if not managed properly.
2. Cellulitis: The patient is being treated for cellulitis, a bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissues. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can spread to deeper layers of the skin and other organs, causing systemic infection.
3. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, indicating impaired heart function. This condition can worsen over time if not managed appropriately, leading to further heart damage and potential complications such as pulmonary edema or arrhythmias.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing atrial fibr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the surgical service for an MRSA wound infection. He has had multiple complications including respiratory arrest, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute renal failure (ARF), and necrotic left foot. The patient's recent issue has been left knee cellulitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient was previously experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure but has since resolved and is stable on therapeutic management (TM).
2. Left knee cellulitis: The patient is being treated with antibiotics (daptomycin and ciprofloxacin) to complete the course for left knee cellulitis. This condition should be monitored for any worsening symptoms or signs of infection.
3. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD): The patient is experiencing pain related to PAD and is being managed with pain control medications such as fentanyl patch and oxycodone. Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is also being administered.
4. Eosinophilia: The patient's elevated eosinophil count is being investigated for potential malignancy, and further tests including flow cytometry and tryptase levels are pending. The patient has also been treated with ivermectin for possible strongyloidiasis, a parasitic infection.
5. Speech-language pathology (SLP): The patient underwent a video swallow test and is scheduled for a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the ICU for MRSA wound infection. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory arrest (likely pneumonia), NSTEMI, ARF, necrotic left foot, and now left knee cellulitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient was initially experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure but has resolved and is stable on therapeutic mechanical ventilation (TM). It is important to continue the COPD regimen and pulmonary toilet to maintain respiratory function.

2. Left knee cellulitis: The patient has left knee cellulitis, and antibiotics have been prescribed. It is crucial to complete the course of antibiotics to treat the infection and prevent further complications.

3. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): The patient has PAD, and pain control measures such as fentanyl patch and neurotin as needed oxycodone have been implemented. Additionally, antiplatelet therapy with ASA and Plavix should be continued to manage PAD.

4. Eosinophilia: The patient has eosinophilia, and further investigation is pending through flow cytometry and tryptase levels. This could be related to an allergic reaction or potential malignancy.

5. Swallowing difficulty: The patient requires a swallowing evaluation due to possible dysphagia. A video swallow test was conducted, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease who underwent right femoral surgery and was admitted to the surgical service for MRSA wound infection. His initial course was complicated by respiratory arrest (likely pneumonia), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute renal failure (ARF), and necrotic left foot. The patient has had a complicated MICU course, including left knee cellulitis, which is now largely resolved. He is awaiting placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has been resolved and the patient is stable on therapeutic management (TM).
2. Left knee cellulitis, for which the patient will continue taking daptomycin and ciprofloxacin to complete the course.
3. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), managed with pain control using a fentanyl patch, neurotin as needed, and oxycodone with good effect. The patient is also on aspirin and Plavix.
4. Eosinophilia, with labs sent for potential malignancy (flow cytometry and tryptase pending for malignancy and hypereosinophilic syndrome).
5. Strongyloides infection, for which the patient has been treated with ivermectin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the surgical service for MRSA wound infection. He had several complications including respiratory arrest (likely pneumonia), NSTEMI, ARF, and necrotic left foot. He also had a left knee cellulitis, which has largely resolved. The patient's recent issues include hypercarbic respiratory failure, left knee cellulitis, PAD (peripheral arterial disease), eosinophilia, and thrombocytosis. The patient underwent a video swallow and will be getting a PEG tube on October 19th. There are concerns about a smoldering infection, and the patient's platelet count continues to climb.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Left knee cellulitis: Although the cellulitis has largely resolved, there is a possibility of recurrence or complications such as sepsis if not properly managed.
3. PAD: The patient's pain should be controlled with medication, and efforts should be made to prevent further complications related to inadequate blood flow to the extremities.
4. Eosinophilia: Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the eosinophilia, and appropriate management should be implemented based on the underlying cause.
5. Thrombocytosis: The patient's elevated platelet count should be monitored, and appropriate measures should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the surgical service for a MRSA wound infection. He has had a complicated medical history, including respiratory arrest, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute renal failure (ARF), and necrotic left foot. The patient has been in the medical ICU (MICU) for the most recent issues, which include a left knee cellulitis. 

The patient's vital signs show atrial fibrillation, with a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/58 mmHg to 100/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis and has several lines, including a PICC line placed on September 19th. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 804 K/uL. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab abnormalities include elevated lactate levels and elevated D-dimer levels. 

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, left knee cellulitis, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and eosinophilia. The treatment plan includes continuing antibiotics for the knee cellulitis, managing PAD with pain control and antiplatelet therapy, and investigating potential malignancy related to the eosinophilia. 

Potential Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory arrest and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection spread: The patient has a history of MRSA wound infection, left knee cellulitis, and may be at risk for further infections. Proper infection control measures should be maintained to prevent the spread of infection.
3. Cardiovascular events: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and atrial fibrillation. Continuous monitoring of cardiac status and prompt management of any arrhythmias or ischemic changes are important to prevent adverse cardiovascular events.
4. Renal function deterioration: The patient's creatinine level indicates impaired renal function. Monitoring renal function closely and adjusting medications accordingly are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary to prevent bleeding complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the surgical service for MRSA wound infection. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory arrest (likely pneumonia), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, necrotic left foot, and complicated medical ICU course. The patient recently had left knee cellulitis, which has largely resolved, and is awaiting a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient was previously experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure but has since resolved and is stable on a tracheostomy (TM).
2) Left knee cellulitis: The patient had left knee cellulitis, which was treated with antibiotics (dapto and cipro) for a two-week course.
3) Peripheral arterial disease (PAD): The patient has PAD and is receiving pain control with a fentanyl patch and neurotin as needed for oxycodone, with good effect. The patient is also on aspirin and Plavix.
4) Eosinophilia: The patient has eosinophilia, and labs have been sent for potential malignancy (flow cytometry and tryptase pending for malignancy and hypereosinophilic syndrome).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with severe peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the surgical service for MRSA wound infection. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory arrest (likely pneumonia), NSTEMI, ARF, necrotic left foot, and left knee cellulitis. 

The patient's current medical issues include hypercarbic respiratory failure, resolved and stable on TM; left knee cellulitis treated with dapto and cipro for 2 weeks; PAD with pain controlled by fentanyl patch, neurotin prn oxycodone; eosinophilia with labs sent for potential malignancy; SLP scheduled for video swallow today; thrombocytosis with concerns regarding smoldering infection persisting; and the need for full CT after PEG tube if platelets continue to climb.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not maintain stable oxygenation, recurrence of cellulitis if proper wound care is not maintained, progression of PAD leading to further pain and potential complications, development of malignancy if eosinophilia is related to an underlying malignancy, and potential bleeding complications due to thrombocytosis.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information, and a thorough evaluation of the patient's condition is necessary for accurate assessment and management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has multiple ongoing health issues. The patient failed a video swallow test, indicating an inability to protect their airway and a risk for aspiration. A plan for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion has been made for October 19th in the interventional radiology (IR) department with anesthesia. The patient also has peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, cellulitis, heart failure (diastolic, acute on chronic), pain control needs, anemia, leukocytosis with eosinophilia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect their airway and failed video swallow test, there is a risk of aspirating food or liquids into the lungs, leading to aspiration pneumonia.
2. PEG tube complications: Insertion of a PEG tube carries potential complications such as infection, bleeding, perforation of the intestines, or leakage of gastric contents.
3. Amputation: The critical limb ischemia indicates reduced blood flow to the extremities, which can lead to tissue death and potential amputation.
4. Cellulitis worsening: Although the patient completed a course of antibiotics for cellulitis, there is still a possibility of the infection worsening or not fully resolving.
5. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen during their hospitalization, potentially requiring additional interventions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions. The patient has failed a video swallow test, indicating an inability to protect their airway and a risk for aspiration. As a result, a plan for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion has been made for the next day in the interventional radiology department with anesthesia.

The patient also has peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and further management is required upon recovery from this hospitalization. The patient recently completed a course of antibiotics for cellulitis. He is being treated for acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure with low-dose lasix and acute and chronic pain with low-dose oxycodone and a fentanyl patch. The patient received a transfusion of packed red blood cells due to anemia and will continue to follow up on it.

Additionally, the patient has leukocytosis with eosinophilia, and an oncology consultation is appreciated to determine if it is likely reactive and not indicative of malignancy. The patient continues to be on medication for atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/65 mmHg to 130/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of difficulty in speech and swallowing. The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, cellulitis, heart failure (diastolic), acute on chronic, pain control, anemia, other, and airway inability to protect. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 129/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on various medications including heparin sodium, ciprofloxacin, and low-dose lasix. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Imaging studies reveal no significant abnormalities. The patient's condition requires further management for peripheral vascular disease, cellulitis, heart failure, pain control, anemia, and airway protection. The patient is scheduled for a video swallow test and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion. Potential medical complications include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers."

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), COPD, and chronic pain. He was admitted initially for a wound infection caused by MRSA and subsequently developed respiratory failure, sepsis, and required a tracheostomy. 

On review of systems, the patient has experienced weight loss, chronic pain in the legs, and has been on home oxygen therapy for COPD. 

Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), Heart rate 99 bpm (normal range 95-114 bpm), Blood pressure 120/65 mmHg (normal range 79-128/46-94 mmHg), Respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute (normal range 12-25 breaths per minute), Oxygen saturation 100% on tracheostomy mask. 

Physical examination reveals a thin, cachectic, and chronically ill-appearing patient with diminished peripheral pulses in the upper and lower extremities, hyperresonant breath sounds on the chest, and muscle wasting in the extremities. 

Laboratory results show a low white blood cell count, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values, including cardiac markers, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a previous bout of pneumonia. He was initially admitted for a wound infection that progressed to respiratory failure and sepsis.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the replacement of his tracheostomy tube, administration of antibiotics, and management of pain control. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen saturation, and his blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature are within normal limits.

Laboratory results show stable levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelets. However, there is a notable increase in creatinine levels, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers are within normal ranges.

Imaging reveals bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions but no significant changes from the previous day.

The patient's diagnoses include peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, acute-on-chronic heart failure, pain control, inability to protect airway, and atrial fibrillation. Treatment plans involve managing these conditions with appropriate medications, monitoring, and interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and PVD, and possible"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, and respiratory failure. He is currently on home oxygen and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a tracheostomy in place due to his inability to protect his airway. He is also experiencing increased secretions, which has led to a sputum culture being sent. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for his increased secretions. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.9 C (98.5 F), heart rate 116 bpm, blood pressure 121/55 mmHg, respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance shows a total input of 360 mL and a total output of 635 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 275 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device of tracheostomy mask and has an ABG result of ///32/. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, thrush, diminished left radial pulse, stable ulcers and gangrene, muscle wasting, warm skin, and attentive with purposeful movement. The patient's lab results show a WBC count ranging from 11.3 to 13.8 thousand/mm3, Hct ranging from 25.1% to 31.9%, and Plt ranging from 572 to 749 thousand/mm3. Other lab results include Cr at 0.5-0.7 mg/dL, Glucose at 83-119 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal limits. The patient's sputum culture shows Gram-negative rods with >25 polys. The patient's assessment and plan include airway protection, heart failure management, pain control, atrial fibrillation rate control, fenestration for G-tube placement, peripheral vascular disease management, and ICU care. The patient is expected to have a tracheostomy and G-tube placed, and will be followed up with vascular surgery as an outpatient. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD who was originally admitted for a wound infection. He has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient is currently unable to protect his airway, has copious secretions, and is at risk for aspiration. His WBC count is stable, and he is being monitored for any increase in oxygen requirement or fever. He will undergo a gastrostomy tube placement tomorrow and will be NPO prior to the procedure. The patient also has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, acute pain, chronic pain, atrial fibrillation controlled with lopressor, and peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia due to inability to protect airway and copious secretions.
2. Sepsis due to recurrent infections.
3. Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
5. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged use of corticosteroids or other medications.
6. Wound infection at the site of tracheostomy or gastrostomy tube placement.
7. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation.
8. Peripheral vascular disease progression leading"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and a previous bout of pneumonia. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's main issues include an inability to protect his airway, heart failure (diastolic, acute on chronic), pain control, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has had recurrent episodes of sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if his secretions are not adequately managed, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure could progress to worsen cardiac output and fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema and other complications.
5. Pain Control: The patient's pain needs to be continuously assessed and managed effectively to prevent further complications and improve overall well-being.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's rate-controlled atrial fibrillation requires close monitoring, and any potential arrhythmia"

He was originally admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient is now status post tracheostomy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 121/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination findings include poor dentition and thrush, symmetric chest expansion with bronchial breath sounds and rhonchi on the left side, and stable ulcers and gangrene on the extremities. Neurological examination reveals attentive behavior, orientation to person, purposeful movements, and stable contractures.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.7, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) levels, and normal platelet count (Plt). Kidney function is within normal limits, while liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values indicate an elevated D-dimer level and mildly decreased albumin level.

The patient's recent sputum culture shows Gram-negative rods with >25 polys and <10 epithelial cells. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension. The patient has been NPO since midnight for planned PEG placement. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/61 mmHg to 94/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antacids, pain management, and prophylactic heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration leading to pneumonia.
2. PEG placement complications: Complications such as bleeding, infection, perforation, or leakage may occur during the PEG placement procedure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Cellulitis: Although the patient completed a course of antibiotics, there is still a possibility of ongoing infection or recurrence.
5. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of heart failure increases the risk of exacerbation, especially with fluid balance changes.
6. Anemia: The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and recent hospitalization for a wound infection. He has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and is now status post tracheostomy. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has copious secretions but no increase in oxygen requirement. His fever curve is improving, and his WBC count continues to improve. He has a history of stenotrophomonas and klebsiella infections. The patient is scheduled for a G-tube placement on [**10-22**] and will be NPO until then, receiving D5 1/2NS maintenance fluids. He is euvolemic and does not require Lasix today. The patient is on fentanyl patch and oxycodone for pain control and is rate-controlled on lopressor for atrial fibrillation. He has peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia and will continue wound care with follow-up with vascular surgery as an outpatient. The patient's eosinophilia is being followed up, and his thrombocytosis has slowly improved along with a decrease in WBC, which may reflect the resolving infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to inability to protect airway and recurrent infections.
2. Cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was originally admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient is now status post tracheostomy on TM. He continues to have copious secretions but no increase in oxygen requirement. The patient's fever curve and WBC count are improving, but he has GNR in his sputum, which is concerning given his history of stenotrophomonas and klebsiella infections. Antibiotic therapy has been deferred for now due to clinical improvement.

The patient's heart failure is managed with PRN lasix and euvolemia. Pain control is achieved with a fentanyl patch and oxycodone PRN. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled on lopressor. His peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia requires ongoing wound care and follow-up with vascular surgery as an outpatient. The patient's eosinophilia is being investigated further (awaiting tryptase and flow).

The patient has a PICC line in place since September 19th. Prophylactic measures include SQ UF heparin for DVT prevention, PPI for stress ulcer prevention, and HOB elevation and mouth care to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition"

Antibiotics have been deferred for now. The patient is scheduled for a gastrostomy tube placement tomorrow and will be NPO prior to the procedure. He has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, for which he is given PRN lasix. He requires pain control, which is being managed with a fentanyl patch and oxycodone as needed. The patient is also being treated for atrial fibrillation with lopressor to control the heart rate. He has peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia, and wound care is being provided. The patient is on various prophylactic treatments including DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention with head-of-bed elevation and mouth care. The patient's code status is full code, and he is to remain in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia. They also have acute-on-chronic heart failure, pain control issues, anemia, airway protection concerns, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, ineffective coping, knowledge deficit, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to immobility and decreased blood flow, there is a risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's inability to protect their airway increases the risk of developing pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation.

3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts them at risk for developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and other complications.

4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of heart failure increase the risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias.

5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of acquiring infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections.

6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which can result in fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

7. Gastrointestinal bleeding"

   placement by IR today.  Unable to get PEG yesterday due to scheduling
   conflict.
   - npo
   - IR guided PEG placement today
   2.       Respiratory.  Now s/p trach, with ongoing suctioning.
   Klebsiella in sputum likely represent colonization given that
   secretions are unchanged, patient Afebrile, with normal wbc.
   - follow respiratory status and consider covering with zosyn if it
   worsens
   3.  PVD.  Awiating revascularization after discharge.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient now has a tracheostomy in place. His current concerns include airway protection due to tracheostomy, heart failure (diastolic), pain control, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of COPD and respiratory failure puts him at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or aspiration pneumonia due to the inability to protect his airway.
2. Infection: Given the patient's history of recurrent sepsis and presence of GNR in the sputum, there is a risk of developing another infection. The patient may require appropriate antibiotic therapy based on culture results.
3. Heart failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. There is a risk of worsening cardiac function leading to fluid overload or hypoperfusion.
4. Pain management: The patient requires adequate pain control for both acute and chronic pain. Insufficient pain management can lead to increased patient discomfort and potential complications.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is rate-controlled on lopressor for his"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient was admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient now has a tracheostomy in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.

2. Tracheostomy-related complications: Complications such as bleeding, infection, or displacement of the tracheostomy tube can occur.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and chronic pain management with NSAIDs or opioids may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload or inadequate cardiac output.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility, advanced age, and underlying cardiovascular disease increase the risk of DVT formation, which can potentially lead to a PE.

6. Wound infection recurrence: The patient's initial admission was for a wound infection, and there is a possibility of recurrence, especially if proper wound care and antibiotic treatment are not maintained.

7. Delirium or cognitive dysfunction: The patient's age,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient now has a tracheostomy in place. He is still experiencing copious secretions, but no increase in oxygen requirement. The patient's fever curve is being monitored, along with his white blood cell count. Klebsiella in the sputum is being deferred for treatment as it is likely a colonizer. The patient is scheduled for a G-tube placement on [**10-22**]. He is NPO and receiving D5 1/2NS maintenance while awaiting the G-tube. The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure and is euvolemic, so PRN lasix is given. Pain control is being managed with a fentanyl patch and oxycodone PRN. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled on lopressor. He has PVD without critical limb ischemia and will continue wound care with follow-up from vascular surgery as an outpatient. The patient's eosinophilia is being followed up with a continuing workup, and thrombocytosis has improved along with a decrease in WBC, possibly reflecting the resolving infection. Other issues are noted in the resident's progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway and the presence of copious secretions, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of aspirin and other medications for pain control puts him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): With the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
5. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The presence of multiple central lines increases the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection.
6. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic heart failure can worsen if his fluid balance is not managed properly.
7. Sepsis: Given the patient's previous episodes of sepsis, he remains at risk for another episode.
8. Gastrointestinal perforation: Prolonged nasogastric tube placement and gastric distension can lead to gastrointestinal perforation.
9. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   secondary to VAP now trached, s/p PEG placement yesterday.
   1.       Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR
   today.
   - d51/2NS
   - can initiate tube feeds in PM
   2.       Respiratory.  Now s/p trach, with ongoing suctioning.
   Klebsiella in sputum likely represent colonization given that
   secretions are unchanged, patient Afebrile, with normal wbc.  Also has
   a second GNR in sputum, awaiting speciation. Was on vent overnight due
   to sedation for procedure, now on pressure support.
   - follow respiratory status and consider covering with zosyn if it
   worsens
   - transition to TCM when more awake
   3.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   5.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   - appears euvolemic to dry on exam
   - d51/2NS while NPO
   - fluid bolus PRN for low urine output
   6.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   7.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   8.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently well rate controlled.
   - continue Lopressor
   9.  Hypothyroidism:  Continue Levothyroxine.
   10.  Thrush:  Clotrimazole troches QID.
   11.  Nutrition:  NPO until PEG placement, can resume tube feeds after
   PEG.  Plan for PEG today.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for malnutrition. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 121/61 to 127/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation mode after being intubated overnight due to sedation for a procedure. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Renal function is within normal limits, with a serum creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Blood glucose levels are also within normal range. Other lab values, including liver function tests and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

The patient's medical conditions include nutrition failure leading to PEG placement, ongoing respiratory failure, peripheral vascular disease, acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, pain control, eosinophilia, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and thrush.

The patient's assessment and plan include nutrition support through PEG, respiratory care with tracheostomy and pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a male with a chief complaint of PVD, respiratory failure after undergoing tracheostomy and PEG placement for malnutrition. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. Allergies include vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been on various infusions and medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Vital signs are within normal range, with stable hemodynamics, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient has a history of poor dentition and a tracheostomy. Physical examination reveals a thin appearance, poor inspiratory effort, and a gangrenous toe. The patient's extremities are absent pulses. Neurologic assessment is not assessed due to sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or further deterioration in oxygenation.
2. Gangrenous Toe: The presence of a gangrenous toe indicates potential peripheral vascular disease and could progress to tissue necrosis or sepsis.
3. Absent Pulses: The absence of pulses in the extremities suggests compromised blood flow, which may result in tissue ischemia, gangrene, or loss of limb.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition status may lead to complications such as delayed wound healing, impaired immune response, and increased risk of infections.

   Sputum [**10-20**].  ESBL klebsiella sensitive only to zosyn and amikacin and
   unspeciated second GNR.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   secondary to VAP now trached, s/p PEG placement yesterday.
   1.       Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR
   today.
   - d51/2NS
   - can initiate tube feeds in PM
   2.       Respiratory.  Now s/p trach, with ongoing suctioning.
   Klebsiella in sputum likely represent colonization given that
   secretions are unchanged, patient Afebrile, with normal wbc.  Also has
   a second GNR in sputum, awaiting speciation. Was on vent overnight due
   to sedation for procedure, now on pressure support.
   - follow respiratory status and consider covering with zosyn if it
   worsens
   - transition to TCM when more awake
   3. Low urine output.  Currently euvolemic.  Will avoid fluid or lasix

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient's current issues include low urine output, PVD, CHF, pain management, eosinophilia, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, thrush, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is now tracheostomized with ongoing suctioning. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), especially with the presence of Klebsiella in the sputum. Monitoring the respiratory status and considering coverage with Zosyn if it worsens is important.

2. Low Urine Output: The patient has low urine output and is euvolemic. Avoiding fluid or Lasix at present may be appropriate, but careful monitoring is necessary to prevent renal complications.

3. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has PVD and is awaiting revascularization after discharge. Management should be coordinated with the vascular surgeon, and further treatment will depend on the patient's recovery from this hospitalization.

4. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. He now has a tracheostomy in place and is being weaned off the ventilator. The patient has copious secretions and is still producing sputum with Klebsiella, but treatment is being deferred as it is likely a colonizer. The patient has multiple medical complications including heart failure, pain control, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, and eosinophilia. His thrombocytosis has slowly improved along with a decrease in WBC count, which may be a reflection of the resolving infection. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments including tube feeds via PEG, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, prophylactic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention measures. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to a rehab or long-term care facility within the next day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, which increases the risk for aspiration and subsequent aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. He now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient is still experiencing copious secretions, but no increase in oxygen requirement. Pulmonary toilet will continue, and the fever curve and WBC count will be monitored. Klebsiella in the sputum is present but treatment is being deferred as it is likely a colonizer. The patient also has a PEG in place and a nutrition consult has been ordered. He is euvolemic, so PRN lasix will be given for heart failure (acute on chronic). Pain control measures are in place, and the patient's atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with lopressor. His peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia will continue to be managed with wound care and follow-up with vascular surgery as an outpatient. Eosinophilia will be followed up with continuing workup (tryptase negative and flow). The thrombocytosis has slowly improved along with the decrease in WBC, which may be a reflection of the resolving infection. Other issues are noted in the resident's note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted initially for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient now has a tracheostomy in place.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Airway Complications: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, which increases the risk of aspiration and altered airway clearance due to the tracheostomy. There is also a risk of further respiratory failure if ventilator weaning is not successful.

2. Infection: The patient has had recurrent infections, including wound infection and sputum culture positive for Klebsiella. There is a risk of further infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.

3. Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, which may worsen if fluid balance is not maintained properly.

4. Pain Management: The patient requires pain control for both acute and chronic pain, which can be challenging in a patient with multiple organ dysfunction.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is rate-controlled on lopressor for his atrial fibrillation, but there is a risk of arrhythmia complications if his cardiac function deteriorates.

6. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has PVD without critical"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy. The patient is currently weaning off ventilatory support and is expected to be transferred to a rehab or long-term care facility soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect his own airway and the presence of copious secretions, there is a risk for aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the tracheostomy tube can lead to pressure ulcers.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent infections, including wound infection, and is at risk for further infections, especially with the presence of an indwelling catheter.
6. Delirium: The patient's age, underlying medical conditions, and prolonged hospitalization make him vulnerable to delirium.
7. Respiratory failure: Weaning off ventilatory support may be challenging due to the patient's respiratory compromise.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient is currently experiencing fevers, leukocytosis, and worsening chest X-ray findings suggestive of a right upper lobe infiltrate. The patient's urine output has been low, and he has a dirty urinary catheter. There is a concern for Klebsiella pneumonia infection, and meropenem has been started. The patient also has a history of stenotrophomonas infection. The patient's pain control and atrial fibrillation are being managed. There are ongoing concerns regarding the patient's heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and eosinophilia. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding, and glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to his history of COPD and recent respiratory failure. Tracheostomy has been performed, but the patient continues to have copious secretions and may require bronchoscopy. The presence of fevers and leukocytosis suggests a possible infection, which could worsen his respiratory status.

2. Sepsis: The patient's recurrent sepsis is a"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He was originally admitted for a wound infection and had a long hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient is now status post tracheostomy on TM.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the inability to protect the airway, there is a risk for aspiration of secretions and subsequent pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to a potentially life-threatening PE if it dislodges.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infections: Long-term indwelling lines such as the PICC line increase the risk of bloodstream infections.
5. Wound infection: Although initially admitted for a wound infection, the patient's wounds should be closely monitored for signs of infection or worsening.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and may be at increased risk for arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation.
7. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers, especially in vulnerable areas like the sacrum or heels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on a tracheostomy tube with copious secretions. He is also experiencing leukocytosis and fevers, with worsening chest X-ray showing a right upper lobe infiltrate. The patient has an infection caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, for which meropenem therapy was started. He also has a history of stenotrophomonas infection, which did not grow on the last sputum culture. The patient's Foley catheter was changed due to a dirty urine analysis, and follow-up urine cultures are pending. The patient's PICC line appears uninfected. His pain control is managed with a fentanyl patch and oxycodone as needed. He is being monitored for atrial fibrillation and peripheral vascular disease. The patient's eosinophilia is being investigated further.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia due to inability to protect airway.
2. Worsening respiratory failure if weaning from mechanical ventilation is unsuccessful.
3. Septic shock due to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.
4. Development of antibiotic resistance due to prolonged antibiotic use.
5. Deep vein throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   secondary to VAP now trached, s/p PEG placement yesterday.
   1.       Fever/leukocytosis.  Now with new temp spike to 101.6 and new
   leukocytosis.  Positive UA and infiltrates on CXR.
   -          start meropenem given known ESBL Klebs in sputum; consider
   Bactrim for stenotrophomonas but more likely colonizer.
   -          f/u urine culture, [**Last Name (un) 430**] should cover orgs.  Foley changed.
   -          send C.diff and resend sputum.
   -          Consider tap of effusion - ?parapneumonic.
   2.       Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR two
   days ago.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   3.       Respiratory.  Now s/p trach, with ongoing suctioning.
   Klebsiella in sputum likely represented colonization given that
   secretions are unchanged, patient was Afebrile, with normal wbc.  Also
   has a second GNR in sputum, awaiting speciation (had stenotrophomonas
   in past).  Back on
                         - cover cultures now that febrile as above.
   4. Low urine output.  Currently appears euvolemic.  Stop IVFs (now that
   at goal on TFs); lasix if not even today.
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   6.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   - appears euvolemic on exam
   - stop IVFs
   - consider lasix as above.
   7.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   7.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   8.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently in NSR in 80s.
   - continue Lopressor
   - not anticoagulating currently.
   9.  Hypothyroidism:  Continue Levothyroxine.
   10.  Thrush:  Clotrimazole troches QID.
   11.  PVD/CAD.  ASA and plavix restarted yesterday.
   12.  Pleural effusion.  Larger on left.  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to fluid overload,
   but consider tap tomorrow as above.  Recheck CXR in AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presented with respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and subsequently underwent tracheostomy (trach) placement. The patient also had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement for nutrition.

24-hour events include fever with a temperature spike to 101.6°F, leukocytosis, positive urine analysis (UA), and new infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR). The patient has been diagnosed with an infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella in the sputum, and appropriate antibiotics have been started. Foley catheter was changed, and cultures are pending.

The patient failed enteral nutrition and received a PEG placement two days ago. He is now on tube feeds at goal. The patient's respiratory status is being managed with ongoing suctioning due to tracheostomy.

The patient's low urine output is attributed to fluid overload, and IV fluids have been stopped. Lasix has been considered if the issue persists. The patient has a history of PVD and is awaiting revascularization after discharge.

The patient's heart failure appears to be diastolic, acute on chronic, and euvolemic. The management plan includes stopping IV fluids and considering lasix. Pain control measures have been implemented, including low"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   secondary to VAP now trached, s/p PEG placement yesterday.
   1.       Fever/leukocytosis.  Now with new temp spike to 101.6 and new
   leukocytosis.  Positive UA and infiltrates on CXR.
   -          start meropenem given known ESBL Klebs in sputum; consider
   Bactrim for stenotrophomonas but more likely colonizer.
   -          f/u urine culture, [**Last Name (un) 430**] should cover orgs.  Foley changed.
   -          send C.diff and resend sputum.
   -          Consider tap of effusion - ?parapneumonic.
   2.       Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR two
   days ago.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   3.       Respiratory.  Now s/p trach, with ongoing suctioning.
   Klebsiella in sputum likely represented colonization given that
   secretions are unchanged, patient was Afebrile, with normal wbc.  Also
   has a second GNR in sputum, awaiting speciation (had stenotrophomonas
   in past).  Back on
                         - cover cultures now that febrile as above.
   4. Low urine output.  Currently appears euvolemic.  Stop IVFs (now that
   at goal on TFs); lasix if not even today.
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   6.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   - appears euvolemic on exam
   - stop IVFs
   - consider lasix as above.
   7.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   7.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   8.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently in NSR in 80s.
   - continue Lopressor
   - not anticoagulating currently.
   9.  Hypothyroidism:  Continue Levothyroxine.
   10.  Thrush:  Clotrimazole troches QID.
   11.  PVD/CAD.  ASA and plavix restarted yesterday.
   12.  Pleural effusion.  Larger on left.  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to fluid overload,
   but consider tap tomorrow as above.  Recheck CXR in AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been intubated and tracheostomized, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed yesterday. The patient presents with fever, leukocytosis, positive urine analysis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray. He has been diagnosed with sepsis and is currently being treated with meropenem for suspected Klebsiella infection. Other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, thrush, peripheral artery disease/CAD, and pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, positive urine analysis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate a possible infection. Treatment with meropenem is appropriate for suspected Klebsiella infection, but other possible organisms should also be considered.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure secondary to VAP raises concerns about potential respiratory failure again. Monitoring his oxygen saturation and respiratory status closely is important.
3. Pleural effusion: The larger left-sided pleural effusion may be due to fluid overload or parapneumonic effusion. Further evaluation, such as thoracentesis, may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been intubated and tracheostomized, and recently underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for nutrition.

The patient presented with fever and leukocytosis, and now has a new temperature spike of 101.6°F and leukocytosis. The urine analysis is positive for 82 WBCs and 19 RBCs. The chest X-ray shows infiltrates in the middle field. The sputum culture is positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella, and there is also a second gram-negative rod present.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient now presents with fevers, leukocytosis, and worsening chest X-ray showing right upper lobe infiltrate. He has an active infection with Klebsiella spp. and also has a history of stenotrophomonas. The patient is currently on meropenem, bactrim, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. He is also receiving lansoprazole, furosemide, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is at risk for aspiration due to his inability to protect his airway. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and low platelet count. His CXR reveals right upper lobe edema and infiltrate, as well as left-sided effusion. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted initially for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy. The patient's chief complaints are sepsis, respiratory failure, and cellulitis.

24-hour events include bronchoscopy and EKG. Allergies include vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been receiving various medications such as meropenem, heparin sodium, furosemide, lansoprazole, and morphine sulfate.

Vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C
- Heart rate: 93 bpm
- Blood pressure: 107/48 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation

Physical examination reveals crackles in the left bronchial area, warm skin, and normal neurologic response. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. There are also abnormalities in electrolyte levels and kidney function tests.

CXR shows right upper lobe edema/infiltrate and left-sided effusion. GNR in the urine and BAL results"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Airway management: The patient is unable to protect his airway, which increases the risk of aspiration and altered airway clearance. He has a tracheostomy in place and requires weaning off ventilatory support.

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, along with worsening chest X-ray findings. He has an infection caused by Klebsiella species, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics. He also has a history of stenotrophomonas infection and a dirty urinary catheter, awaiting urine culture results.

3. Heart failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. His goal is to achieve even fluid balance with the use of Lasix as needed.

4. Pain control: The patient requires management of both acute and chronic pain, for which he is receiving a fentanyl patch and oxycodone as needed.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with lopressor.

   -          wean to TCM today
   2.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient has been
   positive for several days in a row.  Will attempt aggressive diuresis
   and look for improvement of effusion. If no improvement, consider
   thoracentesis to evaluate for emyema.
   -          diuresis with goal of negative 1-2 L
   -          daily CXR
   3.        Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR.

   several days in a row with new pleural effusion.
   - stop IVFs
   - lasix with goal of net negative 1-2 L
   7.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   7.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   8.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently in NSR in 80s.
   - continue Lopressor
   - not anticoagulating currently.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. The patient has been started on meropenem and bactrim, and is expected to be on these antibiotics for 14 days. He has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a right bundle branch block (RBBB) on his ECG. He is receiving diuretics for pleural effusion and congestive heart failure, and is also being managed for pain control and eosinophilia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. The infection is caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, and the patient is currently being treated with meropenem and bactrim.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a history of empyema and is now presenting with a pleural effusion. If the effusion does not improve with diuretics, a thoracentesis may be necessary to evaluate for empyema.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, which is causing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, chronic pain, anemia, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient has been diagnosed with critical limb ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease and requires urgent intervention to prevent limb loss. He also has acute-on-chronic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. The patient is receiving various medications for pain control, infection prophylaxis, and glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia: The patient's condition poses a high risk of limb loss if not promptly addressed. Revascularization procedures or amputation may be considered as treatment options.
2. Acute-on-chronic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction: The patient's heart failure can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiac arrest.
3. Ineffective pain control: The patient's chronic pain requires effective management to ensure comfort and prevent complications like immobility and deep vein thrombosis.
4. Impaired skin integrity: Due to immobility and possible pressure sores, the patient is at risk for impaired skin integrity, which can lead to infections and other complications.
5. Aspiration risk: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, leading to pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
6. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an inflammatory response, possibly due to infection or another underlying condition. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment is crucial.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation and embolic events such as stroke. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.
8. Ineffective coping: The patient's knowledge deficit and impaired coping mechanisms may contribute to anxiety, stress, and overall poor outcomes. Providing appropriate education and support is essential for the patient's well-being.
9. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's prolonged immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and proper skin care are necessary to prevent further complications.
10. Potential complications from medical devices: The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, which can increase the risk of infection or mechanical complications. Regular monitoring and proper care of these devices are vital."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   secondary to VAP now trached, s/p PEG placement yesterday.
   1.       Fever/leukocytosis.  Now with new temp spike to 101.6 and new
   leukocytosis.  Positive UA and infiltrates on CXR.
   -          start meropenem given known ESBL Klebs in sputum; consider
   Bactrim for stenotrophomonas but more likely colonizer.
   -          f/u urine culture, [**Last Name (un) 430**] should cover orgs.  Foley changed.
   -          send C.diff and resend sputum.
   -          Consider tap of effusion - ?parapneumonic.
   2.       Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR two
   days ago.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   3.       Respiratory.  Now s/p trach, with ongoing suctioning.
   Klebsiella in sputum likely represented colonization given that
   secretions are unchanged, patient was Afebrile, with normal wbc.  Also
   has a second GNR in sputum, awaiting speciation (had stenotrophomonas
   in past).  Back on
                         - cover cultures now that febrile as above.
   4. Low urine output.  Currently appears euvolemic.  Stop IVFs (now that
   at goal on TFs); lasix if not even today.
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   6.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   - appears euvolemic on exam
   - stop IVFs
   - consider lasix as above.
   7.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   7.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   8.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently in NSR in 80s.
   - continue Lopressor
   - not anticoagulating currently.
   9.  Hypothyroidism:  Continue Levothyroxine.
   10.  Thrush:  Clotrimazole troches QID.
   11.  PVD/CAD.  ASA and plavix restarted yesterday.
   12.  Pleural effusion.  Larger on left.  [**Month (only) 60**] be due to fluid overload,
   but consider tap tomorrow as above.  Recheck CXR in AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently experiencing fever, leukocytosis, and positive urine analysis with infiltrates on chest X-ray. He has been started on meropenem due to known ESBL Klebsiella in his sputum. Foley catheter has been changed, and cultures are being followed up. The patient also has colonization with a second GNR in his sputum. He has low urine output, which is being managed with fluid restriction and lasix. The patient's PVD is awaiting revascularization after discharge. He has chronic diastolic heart failure, acute on chronic, and is euvolemic on examination. Pain control is being managed with low-dose oxycodone and fentanyl patch. The patient has eosinophilia, which may be due to a drug reaction, and is being monitored with follow-up CBC with diff and peripheral flow cytometry. He also has atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, thrush, PVD/CAD, and a pleural effusion. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   s/p Trach and PEG, now with vent associated ESBL Klebsiella and
   Acineotbacter pneumonia, on Meropenem ([**10-25**]) and Bactrim ([**10-25**]), day 3
   of 14.
   1.       Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension in setting of
   fevers and rigors, concering for sepsis.  However, patient was also
   being diuresed so may have been intravascularly dry.  Ongoing pressor
   requirement in spite of being 2.5L positive is suggestive of sepsis.
   Patient started on daptomycin overnight for gram positive coverage
   (?line, skin).
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
   -          levophed to keep MAPs>60
   -          fluid boluses PRN
   -          f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   -          thoracentesis today given h/o empyema and ongoing fevers and
   sepsis
   -          hold antihypertensives
   2.       Pneumonia.  Patient febrile with leukocytosis and new RUL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Sputum showed ESBL Klebsiella and acinetobacter.
   Now on day 3 of 14 of Meropenem and Bactrim.  Stable O2 requirements on
   TCM.
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**]/bactrim for 14 days
   -          consider thoracentesis if febrile or rising wbc given
   history of empyema
   -          f/u acinetobacter sensitivites
   -          wean to TCM today
   3.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient has been
   positive for several days in a row.  Attempt at diuresis yesterday
   limited by hypotension.
   -          Thoracentesis today to r/o empyema given persistent fevers
   4.        Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR.
                         - on tube feeds at goal

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia. He was initially on meropenem and bactrim but has now been started on daptomycin overnight for gram-positive coverage.
- The patient developed hypotension in the setting of fevers and rigors, raising concerns for sepsis. Despite being 2.5L positive, the patient requires ongoing pressor support, suggesting ongoing sepsis.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows a new right upper lobe infiltrate, and sputum cultures revealed ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. He has been on meropenem and bactrim for three days and is currently stable with TCM.
- The patient has a history of empyema bilaterally and now presents with a pleural effusion. A thoracentesis is planned to rule out empyema.
- The patient failed enteral feeding and underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.
- The patient has dry gangrene of the left lower extremity and is awaiting revascularization after discharge.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   s/p Trach and PEG, now with vent associated ESBL Klebsiella and
   Acineotbacter pneumonia, on Meropenem and Bactrim, day 3 of 14.
   1.       Hypotension.
   2.       Pneumonia.  Patient febrile yesterday with leukocytosis and
   new RUL infiltrate on CXR.  Sputum showed ESBL Klebsiella and
   acinetobacter.  Now on day 2 of 14 of Meropenem and Bactrim.   Briefly
   required vent support, but will wean to trach collar mask today.
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**]/bactrim for 14 days unless acinetobacter is
   sensistive to meropenem
   -          consider thoracentesis if febrile or rising wbc given
   history of empyema
   -          f/u acinetobacter sensitivites
   -          wean to TCM today
   3.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient has been
   positive for several days in a row.  Will attempt aggressive diuresis
   and look for improvement of effusion. If no improvement, consider
   thoracentesis to evaluate for emyema.
   -          diuresis with goal of negative 1-2 L
   -          daily CXR
   4.        Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - continue ASA and plavix
   6.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC.  Now volume up
   several days in a row with new pleural effusion.
   - stop IVFs
   - lasix with goal of net negative 1-2 L
   7.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   7.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   8.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently in NSR in 80s.
   - continue Lopressor
   - not anticoagulating currently.
   9.  Hypothyroidism:  Continue Levothyroxine.
   10.  Thrush:  Clotrimazole troches QID.

   diuresis
   - Will liberalize I/O
   - Fluid boluses as needed
   - Intermittent  norepinephrine as needed for MAP > 60 mmHg.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). Will recheck after fluid boluses.
   - recheck afternoon lights.
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (orf similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative.  He has multiple sites
   of skin break down including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene and
   Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely stable at this
   point. He has been treated more recently for this cellulitis with
   daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.

   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  Check CK
   - We will need to perform thoracentesis to further evaluate the left
   sided effusion after non contrast chest CT scan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and previous hospitalization for wound infection. He was initially admitted for respiratory failure and subsequently developed recurrent sepsis. The patient now presents with hypotension and fevers, suggesting evolving sepsis or overdiuresis. There are multiple areas of skin breakdown including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but sputum and urine cultures show growth of ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's current hypotension and fevers indicate possible evolving sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, and laboratory parameters is crucial.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and was initially admitted for respiratory failure. His current condition with tracheostomy, increased left lower lobe infiltrate, and pleural effusion suggests ongoing respiratory compromise. Bronchoscopy may be necessary if secretions are copious.

3. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown. These require careful wound care management to prevent further complications such as infection.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level"

   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down.

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious
    >Hypotension: concern for evolving SIRS/sepsis as well as over
   diuresis
   - Will liberalize I/O
   - Fluid boluses as needed
   - Intermittent  norepinephrine as needed for MAP > 60 mmHg.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia)
   - recheck afternoon lights.
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and GNR (awaiting spp)  in urine which appears to be an ESBL as
   well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures (including perip and PICC)
   have been negative.  He has multiple sites of skin break down including
   left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all
   of which are largely stable at this point.  Notably negative for c.
   dif.
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on

   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  Check CK
   - We will need to perform thoracentesis to further evaluate the left
   sided effusion after non contrast chest CT scan.

 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - on fentanyl patch and oxycodone prn

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and previous admission for wound infection.
- He was admitted for respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy due to klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in urine.
- The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown.
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, receiving multiple IV medications.
- His vital signs show hypotension, fever, and altered mental status.
- Blood cultures have been negative, but there is evidence of ESBL-producing klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum and urine.
- The patient has leukocytosis and hyponatremia.
- His chest X-ray shows improving right upper lobe infiltrate and increasing left lower lobe pleural effusion.
- The assessment and plan include concerns for airway protection, hypotension, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and fevers.
- The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and intermittent norepinephrine for blood pressure support.
- There are also concerns for heart failure, pain control, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He was originally admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient now has a tracheostomy in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's worsening condition with fevers, increasing white blood cell count, and worsening chest X-ray with right upper lobe infiltrate indicates a possible Klebsiella spp. infection. This, along with the presence of GNR in the urine, suggests a high risk for sepsis.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, which may worsen due to fluid overload and inadequate diuresis.
4. Pain Control: The patient requires pain management for both acute and chronic pain, but there is no specific mention of pain assessment or intervention in the progress note.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is rate-controlled on lopressor for atrial fibrillation, but there is no mention of rhythm control or anticoagulation therapy.
6. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has PVD without critical limb ischemia, and wound care is being continued with follow-up with"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, CAD, PVD, and previous hospitalization for wound infection. He was admitted for respiratory failure and has since experienced recurrent sepsis. The patient now presents with hypotension and fevers, indicating a possible evolving sepsis and overdiuresis. His blood cultures are negative, but he has positive sputum and urine cultures for ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. He has multiple areas of skin breakdown, including a stage 2 ulcer with black eschar on his left knee, gangrenous toes, and Achilles tendon breakdown. The patient has been treated with daptomycin for his cellulitis, but now requires a different antibiotic due to allergies. He also has a history of coag-negative staph infection and was empirically treated for left-sided cellulitis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has an improving right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, as well as an increasing left lower lobe pleural effusion. The plan includes continuing pulmonary toilet, bronchoscopy if needed, fluid boluses, norepinephrine for blood pressure support, and close monitoring of renal function. Thoracentesis is also planned to evaluate the left-sided effusion. The patient's pain will be managed with fentanyl patch and oxycodone as needed, and metoprolol will be held due"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was originally admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now presents with fever and hypotension. The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is on mechanical ventilation. He has klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum, as well as klebsiella in his urine. There are multiple areas of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including daptomycin for cellulitis. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Airway: Inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance). The patient has a tracheostomy in place and will continue pulmonary toilet. Bronchoscopy may be performed if secretions are copious.

2. Hypotension: Concern for evolving SIRS/sepsis as well as overdiuresis. The patient will receive fluid boluses as needed, and intermittent norepinephrine may be used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. Hyponatremia: Possible reflection of fluid shifts (likely hypovolemia). The patient's sodium levels will be rechecked after fluid boluses.

4. Leukocytosis and fevers: ESBL Klebsiella and acinetobacter from sputum and klebsiella in urine. The patient has been treated with meropenem and bactrim. Blood cultures have been negative so far.

5. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple sites of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown. These areas appear to be largely stable at this point.

6. Heart failure (CHF): The patient's I/O goals will be liberalized in the setting of his fevers and SIRS/sepsis.

7. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient is on a fentanyl patch and oxycodone as needed.

8. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): Metoprolol will be held in the setting of sepsis.

9. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia: The patient's wound care will be continued, and he will follow up with vascular surgery as an outpatient.

Other issues mentioned in the ICU resident's note include nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC line and 20-gauge line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), and comments regarding code status and disposition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   s/p Trach and PEG, now with vent associated ESBL Klebsiella and
   Acineotbacter pneumonia, on Meropenem ([**10-25**]) and Bactrim ([**10-25**]), day 4
   of 14.
   1.       Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension in setting of
   fevers and rigors, concerning for sepsis.  However, patient was also
   being diuresed so may have been intravascularly dry.  Had ongoing
   pressor requirement, now off levophed.  On daptomycin, meropenem, and
   bactrim (acinetobacter).
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
   -          levophed to keep MAPs>60
   -          fluid boluses PRN
   -          f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   -          thoracentesis vs. pigtail placement; today vs tomorrow given
   h/o empyema and ongoing fevers and sepsis.  Effusion increasing (also
   has been positive).
   -          hold antihypertensives, no lasix yet.
   2.       Pneumonia/fever.  Patient febrile with leukocytosis and new
   RUL infiltrate on CXR.  Sputum showed ESBL Klebsiella and
   acinetobacter.  Now on day 4 of 14 of Meropenem and Bactrim.  Off and
   on vent as of late.
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**]/bactrim for 14 day; dapto also added.
   -          Thoracentesis as above.
   3.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient continues to be
   in positive fluid balance.  .
   -          Thoracentesis or pigtail as above.
   -          Hold on lasix/diuresis for now.
   4.        Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - continue ASA and plavix
   6. Hyponatremia.  Currently hypervolemic; ?due to hypervolemia vs.
   SIADH.
                  - check urine lytes
                  - PM lytes
                  - can decrease free water flushes if continues.
   7.  UTI.  Multiple ESBL Klebsiella species.  Sensitive to meropenem
   (last Klebs MIC panel pending).
   8.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC.  Now volume up
   several days in a row with new pleural effusion.  Unable to diurese due
   to hypotension requiring pressors.
   - fluid as needed to maintain blood pressure
   9.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   10.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   11.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently in NSR in 80s.
   - hold Lopressor
   - not anticoagulating currently.
   12.  Hypothyroidism:  Continue Levothyroxine.
   13.  Thrush:  Clotrimazole troches QID.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   s/p Trach and PEG, now with vent associated ESBL Klebsiella and
   Acineotbacter pneumonia, on Meropenem ([**10-25**]) and Bactrim ([**10-25**]), day 3
   of 14.
   1.       Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension in setting of
   fevers and rigors, concering for sepsis.  However, patient was also
   being diuresed so may have been intravascularly dry.  Ongoing pressor
   requirement in spite of being 2.5L positive is suggestive of sepsis.
   Patient started on daptomycin overnight for gram positive coverage
   (?line, skin).
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
   -          levophed to keep MAPs>60

   -          thoracentesis today given h/o empyema and ongoing fevers and
   sepsis
   -          hold antihypertensives
   2.       Pneumonia.  Patient febrile with leukocytosis and new RUL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Sputum showed ESBL Klebsiella and acinetobacter.
   Now on day 3 of 14 of Meropenem and Bactrim.  Stable O2 requirements on
   TCM.
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**]/bactrim for 14 days
   -          consider thoracentesis if febrile or rising wbc given
   history of empyema
   -          f/u acinetobacter sensitivites
   -          wean to TCM today
   3.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient has been
   positive for several days in a row.  Attempt at diuresis yesterday
   limited by hypotension.
   -          Thoracentesis today to r/o empyema given persistent fevers
   4.        Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - continue ASA and plavix
   6.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC.  Now volume up
   several days in a row with new pleural effusion.  Unable to diurese due
   to hypotension requiring pressors.
   - fluid as needed to maintain blood pressure

","The patient's chief complaint is sepsis. The patient has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis, which are concerning for sepsis. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, receiving multiple antibiotics (meropenem and bactrim), and has been started on daptomycin for gram-positive coverage.

The patient has a history of chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient also has a recent history of respiratory failure, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's blood cultures have grown ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level.

The patient's physical examination reveals alertness and interaction, but the neurologic examination is not assessed. The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's plan includes continued antibiotic therapy with meropenem and bactrim for 14 days, consideration of thoracentesis if febrile or with a rising WBC count given the history of empyema, weaning off ventilator support, and close monitoring of fluid status and blood pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. The patient also has a history of empyema and is currently experiencing hypotension, pleural effusion, and sepsis. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including daptomycin, meropenem, and bactrim. The patient's medical history includes chronic pain, eosinophilia, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and thrush. He is currently being treated with various medications, including levophed, norepinephrine, lansoprazole, heparin, and fentanyl patch.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and ongoing pressor requirement suggest the possibility of sepsis, especially considering the presence of fevers and rigors.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis, fever, and new right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray indicate the possibility of pneumonia.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient's history of empyema and the presence of pleural effusion raise concerns for a recurrence of empyema.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient's condition has been critical, requiring invasive ventilation and continuous monitoring of vital signs. The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, heart failure (diastolic, acute on chronic), pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), anemia, and other conditions. The patient also has airway issues, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, ineffective coping, knowledge deficit, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged invasive ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
3. Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) due to systemic inflammation and decreased renal perfusion.
4. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and impaired skin integrity.
5. Delirium or ICU psychosis due to the stress of critical illness and sensory deprivation.
6. ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) due to high tidal volumes and barotrauma.
7. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) due to catheter-related bloodstream infections.
8. Nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia) due to aspiration risk and inability to clear secretions.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   s/p Trach and PEG, now with vent associated ESBL Klebsiella and
   Acineotbacter pneumonia, on Meropenem ([**10-25**]) and Bactrim ([**10-25**]), day 3
   of 14.
   1.       Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension in setting of
   fevers and rigors, concering for sepsis.  However, patient was also
   being diuresed so may have been intravascularly dry.  Ongoing pressor
   requirement in spite of being 2.5L positive is suggestive of sepsis.
   Patient started on daptomycin overnight for gram positive coverage
   (?line, skin).
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
   -          levophed to keep MAPs>60
   -          fluid boluses PRN
   -          f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   -          thoracentesis today given h/o empyema and ongoing fevers and
   sepsis
   -          hold antihypertensives
   2.       Pneumonia.  Patient febrile with leukocytosis and new RUL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Sputum showed ESBL Klebsiella and acinetobacter.
   Now on day 3 of 14 of Meropenem and Bactrim.  Stable O2 requirements on
   TCM.
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**]/bactrim for 14 days
   -          consider thoracentesis if febrile or rising wbc given
   history of empyema
   -          f/u acinetobacter sensitivites
   -          wean to TCM today
   3.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient has been
   positive for several days in a row.  Attempt at diuresis yesterday
   limited by hypotension.
   -          Thoracentesis today to r/o empyema given persistent fevers
   4.        Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - continue ASA and plavix
   6.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC.  Now volume up
   several days in a row with new pleural effusion.  Unable to diurese due
   to hypotension requiring pressors.
   - fluid as needed to maintain blood pressure
   7.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   7.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   8.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently in NSR in 80s.
   - hold Lopressor
   - not anticoagulating currently.
   9.  Hypothyroidism:  Continue Levothyroxine.
   10.  Thrush:  Clotrimazole troches QID.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and recent respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia with meropenem and bactrim. This is the third day of a 14-day treatment plan.
- The patient developed hypotension, fevers, and rigors, raising concerns for sepsis. Pressor requirement suggests possible sepsis, and daptomycin has been started for gram-positive coverage.
- The patient has a history of empyema and currently has pleural effusions. Thoracentesis is planned to rule out empyema.
- The patient's pain control includes low-dose oxycodone and a fentanyl patch.
- The patient has eosinophilia after treatment for strongyloides with ivermectin.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently in normal sinus rhythm.
- Other medical conditions include hypothyroidism, thrush, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fevers, and rigors suggest the possibility of sepsis. Ongoing pressor requirement indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, and fluid boluses may be needed"

   Imaging: CT chest [**10-27**]: 1. Small right and small-to-moderate left
   pleural effusions, with loculated components along the left. There is
   again associated atelectasis in the posterior right upper lobe and both
   lower lobes. Again cystic regions are
   noted within the consolidated right lower lobe which could represent a
   component of emphysema, although again superimposedright lower lobe
   infection  with necrotic component is likely. Overall, these findings
   are similar to
   that seen on [**2125-9-24**].
   2. Lymphadenopathy, both mediastinal and right hilar, are incompletely
   assessed without IV contrast.
   3. Medullary nephrocalcinosis, as before.
   4. Underlying emphysema.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension..
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. He may need a longer trach.
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   >Hypotension: concern for evolving SIRS/sepsis as well as over diuresis
   - Will liberalize I/O
   - Fluid boluses as needed
   - Intermittent  norepinephrine as needed for MAP > 60 mmHg.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This may be SIADH vs now volume overload. He may need
   free water restriction. Will check urine lytes as he has become
   progressively more hyponatremic
   - Urine lytes to help guide therapy.
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative on multiple assays.  He
   has multiple sites of skin break down including left knee cellulitis,
   toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely
   stable at this point. He has been treated more recently for this
   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  Check CK
   - We will need to perform thoracentesis to further evaluate the left
   sided effusion , the CT report reads as ""loculations"" whichif true
   would necessitate a pig tail catheter

 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - on fentanyl patch and oxycodone prn

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt
    Other issues per ICU resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was originally admitted for a wound infection and has since developed respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's current conditions include:

1. Inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, cough) due to tracheostomy.
2. Hypotension: concern for evolving SIRS/sepsis as well as overdiuresis.
3. Hyponatremia: possible reflection of fluid shifts (likely hypovolemia.), may be SIADH or volume overload.
4. Leukocytosis and fevers: ESBL Klebsiella and acinetobacter from sputum and Klebsiella in urine.
5. Skin breakdown with multiple areas of ulceration.
6. Left-sided pleural effusion.
7. Medullary nephrocalcinosis.
8. Underlying emphysema.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia due to the inability to protect the airway.
2. Sepsis and septic shock due to the presence of fevers and leukocytosis.
3. Renal failure due to the hyponatremia and possible fluid overload.
4. Respiratory failure due to the underlying"

   Imaging: CT chest [**10-27**]: 1. Small right and small-to-moderate left
   pleural effusions, with loculated components along the left. There is
   again associated atelectasis in the posterior right upper lobe and both
   lower lobes. Again cystic regions are
   noted within the consolidated right lower lobe which could represent a
   component of emphysema, although again superimposedright lower lobe
   infection  with necrotic component is likely. Overall, these findings
   are similar to
   that seen on [**2125-9-24**].

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension..
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. He may need a longer trach.
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   >Hypotension: concern for evolving SIRS/sepsis as well as over diuresis
   - Will liberalize I/O
   - Fluid boluses as needed
   - Intermittent  norepinephrine as needed for MAP > 60 mmHg.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This may be SIADH vs now volume overload. He may need
   free water restriction. Will check urine lytes as he has become
   progressively more hyponatremic
   - Urine lytes to help guide therapy.
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative on multiple assays.  He
   has multiple sites of skin break down including left knee cellulitis,
   toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely
   stable at this point. He has been treated more recently for this
   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  Check CK
   - We will need to perform thoracentesis to further evaluate the left
   sided effusion , the CT report reads as ""loculations"" whichif true
   would necessitate a pig tail catheter

 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - on fentanyl patch and oxycodone prn

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation support and has a history of COPD, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. 

2. Sepsis: The patient has recurrent fevers, leukocytosis, hypotension, and positive cultures for Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, indicating a possible ongoing infection and sepsis.

3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a left-sided pleural effusion, which may require further evaluation and management.

4. Skin breakdown: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown. These skin ulcers need to be closely monitored for potential infection.

5. Renal function: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the use of nephrotoxic antibiotics and the presence of medullary nephrocalcinosis on imaging.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which could be related to fluid shifts, overdiuresis, or SIADH. It is important to manage this electrolyte imbalance carefully.

7. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of CAD and PVD, and there are concerns about evolving heart failure (CHF) due to fluid overload and hypotension.

8. Pain control: The patient requires adequate pain"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was originally admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to an inability to protect his airway. He has klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine, as well as multiple areas of skin breakdown causing recent fevers and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The presence of klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum and klebsiella in the urine, along with the patient's fevers and hypotension, suggest ongoing sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure due to the underlying COPD, emphysema, and atelectasis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT formation.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient's multiple areas of skin breakdown increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

   Imaging: CT chest [**10-27**]: 1. Small right and small-to-moderate left
   pleural effusions, with loculated components along the left. There is
   again associated atelectasis in the posterior right upper lobe and both
   lower lobes. Again cystic regions are
   noted within the consolidated right lower lobe which could represent a
   component of emphysema, although again superimposedright lower lobe
   infection  with necrotic component is likely. Overall, these findings
   are similar to
   that seen on [**2125-9-24**].

   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension..
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. He may need a longer trach.
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   >Hypotension: concern for evolving SIRS/sepsis as well as over diuresis
   - Will liberalize I/O
   - Fluid boluses as needed
   - Intermittent  norepinephrine as needed for MAP > 60 mmHg.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This may be SIADH vs now volume overload. He may need
   free water restriction. Will check urine lytes as he has become
   progressively more hyponatremic
   - Urine lytes to help guide therapy.
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative on multiple assays.  He
   has multiple sites of skin break down including left knee cellulitis,
   toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely
   stable at this point. He has been treated more recently for this
   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  Check CK
   - We will need to perform thoracentesis to further evaluate the left
   sided effusion , the CT report reads as ""loculations"" whichif true
   would necessitate a pig tail catheter

 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] and discussed his case with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1162**],
   whose note above reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that
   although Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] has been quite febrile, the past 24 hours have shown
   a decreasing fever curve.
   [image004.jpg]
   Main issue is ongoing fevers and infection (pneumonia and urine >>
   skin, toe gangrene).  We will continue meropenem and Bactrim for Klebs
   and acinetobacter.  Given prior reported allergies, he is on dapto for
   GPC coverage.  This is reasonable given no apparent GPCs in pulmonary
   microbiology.  In addition, will discuss with IP regarding
   thoracentesis vs. pigtail drainage of pleural effusion.  In past taps
   this has not been infected.
   Other issues as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1162**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ethanol abuse, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and is now status post tracheostomy. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and multiple skin breakdowns. He is critically ill with ongoing fevers and infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and toe gangrene. The patient is on invasive ventilation, and his vital signs are unstable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and the need for tracheostomy indicate a compromised respiratory system. The ongoing pneumonia and atelectasis seen on imaging suggest a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for klebsiella and acinetobacter indicate an ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis, which is already suspected given the hypotension and tachycardia.
3. Heart failure: The patient's hypotension and hyponatremia may be indicative of heart failure. Fluid overload due to diuresis or an underlying cardiac condition could contribute to these symptoms.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of emphysema suggest"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and previous hospitalization for wound infection. He was admitted for respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now presents with klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum, as well as klebsiella in the urine. The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, leading to recent fevers and hypotension. He underwent a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
3. Sepsis: The presence of klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum and urine indicates a possible source of infection, which could progress to sepsis.
4. Skin infections: The multiple areas of skin breakdown increase the risk of developing further skin infections.
5. Heart failure: The patient's hypotension and fluid balance issues may indicate heart failure.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels could be due to fluid shifts or SIADH.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing D"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension..

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. He may need a longer trach.
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   >Hypotension: concern for evolving SIRS/sepsis as well as over diuresis
   - Will liberalize I/O
   - Fluid boluses as needed
   - Intermittent  norepinephrine as needed for MAP > 60 mmHg.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This may be SIADH vs now volume overload. He may need
   free water restriction. Will check urine lytes as he has become
   progressively more hyponatremic
   - Urine lytes to help guide therapy.
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative on multiple assays.  He
   has multiple sites of skin break down including left knee cellulitis,
   toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely
   stable at this point. He has been treated more recently for this
   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  Check CK
   - We will need to perform thoracentesis to further evaluate the left
   sided effusion , the CT report reads as ""loculations"" whichif true
   would necessitate a pig tail catheter

 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - on fentanyl patch and oxycodone prn

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt
    Other issues per ICU resident note.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and previous bilateral lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition includes the inability to protect his airway, hypotension, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and fevers. He has an infection with ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter in his sputum and Klebsiella in his urine. He also has multiple areas of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggest ongoing infection and possible sepsis. This is further supported by the presence of ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter in his sputum and Klebsiella in his urine.

3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia may be a reflection of fluid shifts, possibly due to overdiuresis or SIADH. It is important"

   Acineotbacter pneumonia, on Meropenem ([**10-25**]) and Bactrim ([**10-25**]), day 4
   of 14.
   1.       Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension in setting of
   fevers and rigors, concerning for sepsis.  However, patient was also
   being diuresed so may have been intravascularly dry.  Had ongoing
   pressor requirement, now off levophed.  On daptomycin, meropenem, and
   bactrim (acinetobacter).

   has been positive).
   -          hold antihypertensives, no lasix yet.
   2.       Pneumonia/fever.  Patient febrile with leukocytosis and new
   RUL infiltrate on CXR.  Sputum showed ESBL Klebsiella and
   acinetobacter.  Now on day 4 of 14 of Meropenem and Bactrim.  Off and
   on vent as of late.
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**]/bactrim for 14 day; dapto also added.
   -          Thoracentesis as above.
   3.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient continues to be
   in positive fluid balance.  .
   -          Thoracentesis or pigtail as above.
   -          Hold on lasix/diuresis for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species. The patient also has a pleural effusion, which is positive for the same bacteria. He is on meropenem and bactrim for antibiotic treatment. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, pneumonia/fever, pleural effusion, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyponatremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic, pain control, eosinophilia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypothyroidism, and thrush.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fevers, and positive cultures for bacteria indicate a high risk for sepsis.
2. Organ failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hyponatremia suggest potential renal dysfunction. The presence of heart failure (CHF) and positive fluid balance indicate a risk of cardiovascular compromise.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion, along with his history of empyema, may lead to complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical complications, including hypotension, hyponatremia, PVD with critical limb ischemia, heart failure, pain control issues, anemia, airway protection difficulties, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, ineffective coping, knowledge deficit, impaired skin integrity, and PVD without critical limb ischemia. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently below the normal range, indicating low blood pressure. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can result in symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and even coma if left untreated.
3. PVD with critical limb ischemia: The patient has peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, which means there is reduced blood flow to the extremities. This increases the risk of tissue damage, ulcers, and possible amputation.
4. Heart failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, indicating impaired cardiac function. This can lead to fluid accumulation, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
5. Pain control issues: The patient has both acute and chronic pain, which may require appropriate pain management strategies to prevent discomfort and complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia could contribute to fatigue, weakness"

   IMPRESSIONS:
   1. Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions, with
   loculated
   components along the left. There is again associated atelectasis in the
   posterior right upper lobe and both lower lobes. Again cystic regions
   are
   noted within the consolidated right lower lobe which could represent a
   component of emphysema, although again superimposed right lower lobe
   infection
   with necrotic component is likely. Overall, these findings are similar
   to
   that seen on [**2125-9-24**].
   2. Lymphadenopathy, both mediastinal and right hilar, are incompletely
   assessed without IV contrast.
   3. Medullary nephrocalcinosis, as before.
   4. Underlying emphysema.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure

   of 14.
   1.       Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension in setting of
   fevers and rigors, concerning for sepsis.  However, patient was also
   being diuresed so may have been intravascularly dry.  Had ongoing
   pressor requirement, now off levophed.  On daptomycin, meropenem, and
   bactrim (acinetobacter).
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
   -          levophed to keep MAPs>60
   -          fluid boluses PRN
   -          f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   -          thoracentesis vs. pigtail placement; today vs tomorrow given
   h/o empyema and ongoing fevers and sepsis.  Effusion increasing (also
   has been positive).
   -          hold antihypertensives, no lasix yet.
   2.       Pneumonia/fever.  Patient febrile with leukocytosis and new
   RUL infiltrate on CXR.  Sputum showed ESBL Klebsiella and
   acinetobacter.  Now on day 4 of 14 of Meropenem and Bactrim.  Off and
   on vent as of late.
   -          continue [**Last Name (un) 430**]/bactrim for 14 day; dapto also added.
   -          Thoracentesis as above.
   3.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient continues to be
   in positive fluid balance.  .
   -          Thoracentesis or pigtail as above.
   -          Hold on lasix/diuresis for now.
   4.        Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - continue ASA and plavix
   6. Hyponatremia.  Currently hypervolemic; ?due to hypervolemia vs.
   SIADH.
                  - check urine lytes
                  - PM lytes
                  - can decrease free water flushes if continues.
   7.  UTI.  Multiple ESBL Klebsiella species.  Sensitive to meropenem
   (last Klebs MIC panel pending).
   8.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC.  Now volume up
   several days in a row with new pleural effusion.  Unable to diurese due
   to hypotension requiring pressors.
   - fluid as needed to maintain blood pressure
   9.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   10.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   11.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently in NSR in 80s.
   - hold Lopressor
   - not anticoagulating currently.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   s/p Trach and PEG, now with vent associated ESBL Klebsiella and
   Acineotbacter pneumonia, on Meropenem ([**10-25**]) and Bactrim ([**10-25**]), day 5
   of 14, and day 3 of empiric daptomycin.
   1.       Septic shock. Patient has hypotension, fever, leukocytosis
   with ESBL pneumonia and acineobactor pneumonia.  Clinical picture
   consistent with pneumo-sepsis.  Now titrated off pressors and
   hemodynamically stable.  On [**Last Name (un) 430**] for ESBL klebsiella and Bactrim for
   acinetobacter PNA, and empiric dapto (?line, skin).
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
   -          levophed to keep MAPs>60
   -          fluid boluses PRN
   -          f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   -          hold antihypertensives, no lasix yet.
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Patient has pneumonia (ESBL klebsiella
   and acinetobacter), bilaterally pleural effusions, and b/l pneumonia.
   Was on pressure support overnight.  Unable to diurese at present due to
   low blood pressure, but will treat pneumonia with antibiotics and place
   pigtail catheter today.
                   -  [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, for pna
                   - wean off vent if possible
                  - pigtail catheter placement
   3.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient continues to be
   in positive fluid balance.   Fever, wbc trending down, but requiring
   vent support off an on.  Will place pigtail today to improve
   respiratory status.
   -          Pigtail catheter palcement
   -          Hold on lasix/diuresis for now.
            4.  Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to SIADH.  Will free water
   restrict and check serial lytes.  Will avoid diuresis with lasix at
   present due to hypotension, but consider lasix diuresis in AM.
                  - minimize free water flushes
   - serial lytes
   4.        Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to severe pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, hyponatremia, and chronic pain. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, eosinophilia, strongyloidiasis, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension, fever, and leukocytosis indicate a potential complication of septic shock due to ESBL pneumonia and Acinetobacter pneumonia. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued administration of appropriate antibiotics are necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator should be attempted if possible, and a pigtail catheter may be placed to improve respiratory status.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient's history of empyema and current pleural effusion suggest a potential complication. Placement of a pigtail catheter today may help improve respiratory status.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's low serum"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing intermittent desats while off ventilator support, persistent hyponatremia, and toe dry gangrene on the left lower extremity. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/54 mmHg to 158/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, heparin sodium, and regular insulin. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's peripheral pulses are absent in both lower extremities, and the physical examination reveals temporal wasting, rhonchorous breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and dry gangrene on the left toe.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which is a life-threatening complication of an infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and abnormal chest x-ray suggest pneumonia, which can worsen the respiratory status.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's intermittent desats while off ventilator support indicate potential respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension..

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. He may need a longer trach.
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   >Hypotension: concern for evolving SIRS/sepsis as well as over diuresis
   - Will liberalize I/O
   - Fluid boluses as needed
   - Intermittent  norepinephrine as needed for MAP > 60 mmHg.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This may be SIADH vs now volume overload. He may need
   free water restriction. Will check urine lytes as he has become
   progressively more hyponatremic. UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH. He
   appears  normovolemic (and is also getting free water from the IV
   bactrim which we can change to PO )
   - Urine lytes to help guide therapy.
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative on multiple assays.  He
   has multiple sites of skin break down including left knee cellulitis,
   toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely
   stable at this point. He has been treated more recently for this
   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.  Over the
   last two days his WBC has cont to improve.
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  CK ok on daptomycin
   - We will need to perform thoracentesis to further evaluate the left
   sided effusion , the CT report reads as ""loculations"" whichif true
   would necessitate a pig tail catheter

 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - on fentanyl patch and oxycodone prn

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD who was admitted for a wound infection. He has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, fever, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and multiple skin breakdowns. The patient's airway is compromised due to the inability to protect it, and there is a risk for aspiration. The patient is also experiencing heart failure, pain control issues, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter suggest a possible evolving sepsis. This is further supported by his hypotension and tachycardia. Immediate management should include fluid resuscitation and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to his inability to clear secretions effectively, recurrent infections, and compromised airway protection. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and weaning from mechanical ventilation is necessary. Bronchoscopy may be required if secretions are copious.

3. Skin Breakdown and Infection: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the

   fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non functioning G
   tube and concern on exam for an acute abdomen (obstruction vs
   perforation)

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. Will change ventilatory support
   for today
   - ventilatory with PSV
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This may is likely from the free water we gave. He will
   cont free water restriction.  UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH.
   >Hyperkalemia: stable renal function, will check urine lytes and CK to
   try to evaluate for evolving rhabdomyolysis (? Related to abdominal
   process vs RTA).
   - urine lytes, CK
   - recheck afternoon lytes
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures

   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.  Over the
   last two days his WBC has cont to improve.  The thoracentesis has a
   transdative fluid with pH 7.26 (220 WBC, 81% lymphs). Gram stain is
   negative
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previously admitted for wound infection. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now presents with klebsiella and acinetobacter in sputum and urine, along with multiple areas of skin breakdown. The patient has had a tracheostomy performed and is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent laboratory results show hyponatremia (low sodium levels), hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), and fevers. Blood cultures have been negative, but sputum and urine cultures have grown ESBL-producing Klebsiella and acinetobacter. The patient has multiple sites of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown. He has been treated with daptomycin for the cellulitis.

The patient's current assessment includes inability to protect airway, ventilatory support with pressure support ventilation (PSV), concern for acute abdomen (obstruction vs perforation), hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and leukocytosis with fevers. The patient has also been on fentanyl patch and oxycodone for pain control, and metoprolol has been held due to sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non functioning G
   tube and concern on exam for an acute abdomen (obstruction vs
   perforation)

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. Will change ventilatory support
   for today
   - ventilatory with PSV
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This may be SIADH vs now volume overload. He may need
   free water restriction. Will check urine lytes as he has become
   progressively more hyponatremic. UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH.
   Will change bactrim back to IV given development in the abdomen and
   monitor Na closely
   Hyperkalemia: stable renal function, will check urine lytes and CK to
   try to evaluate for evolving rhabdomyolysis (? Related to abdominal
   process vs RTA).
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative on multiple assays.  He
   has multiple sites of skin break down including left knee cellulitis,
   toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely
   stable at this point. He has been treated more recently for this
   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.  Over the
   last two days his WBC has cont to improve.  The thoracentesis has a
   transdative fluid with pH 7.26 (220 WBC, 81% lymphs). Gram stain is
   negative
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  CK ok on daptomycin
   - S/p thoracentesis with removal of 1200 cc, does not appear infected
   Abdominal distension: concern for high grade obstruction vs
   perforation. Lactate, ABG, serial exam, Surgical consult, NG tube
   placed., IR consult for PEG tube.
   - Add metronidazole
 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - on fentanyl patch and oxycodone prn
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt
    Other issues per ICU resident note.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non functioning G
   tube and concern on exam for an acute abdomen (obstruction vs
   perforation)

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. Will change ventilatory support
   for today
   - ventilatory with PSV
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This may is likely from the free water we gave. He will
   cont free water restriction.  UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH.
   >Hyperkalemia: stable renal function, will check urine lytes and CK to
   try to evaluate for evolving rhabdomyolysis (? Related to abdominal
   process vs RTA).
   - urine lytes, CK
   - recheck afternoon lytes
    > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative on multiple assays.  He
   has multiple sites of skin break down including left knee cellulitis,
   toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely
   stable at this point. He has been treated more recently for this
   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.  Over the
   last two days his WBC has cont to improve.  The thoracentesis has a
   transdative fluid with pH 7.26 (220 WBC, 81% lymphs). Gram stain is
   negative
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  CK ok on daptomycin
   - S/p thoracentesis with removal of 1200 cc, does not appear infected
   >Abdominal distension: concern for high grade obstruction vs
   perforation. Lactate, ABG, serial exam, Surgical consult, NG tube
   placed., IR consult for PEG tube.
   - Add metronidazole
 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - on fentanyl patch and oxycodone prn
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:
   holding plavix pending resolution of possible SBO
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt
   Other issues per ICU resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. The patient was admitted initially for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now presents with an acute abdomen. 

The patient's current condition includes an inability to protect his airway, requiring tracheostomy and ventilatory support. He has non-functioning G tube and concern for an acute abdomen, possibly due to obstruction or perforation. 

Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis, and fevers, indicating ongoing infection. Blood cultures have been negative, but sputum and urine cultures show ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. The patient has multiple sites of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown. 

The patient's treatment plan involves continued pulmonary toilet, bronchoscopy if secretions are copious, fluid restriction for hyponatremia, recheck of electrolytes, urine lytes, CK, and meropenem for GNR urinary infection, Bactrim for Acinetobacter, and surgical consult for possible abdominal issues. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further episodes of sepsis, progression of skin breakdown leading to deeper tissue infections or gangrene, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5700**] is a 75 yo male with CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p respiratory failure
   s/p Trach and PEG, now with vent associated ESBL Klebsiella and
   Acineotbacter pneumonia, on Meropenem ([**10-25**]) and Bactrim ([**10-25**]), day 5
   of 14, and day 3 of empiric daptomycin.
   1.       Septic shock. Patient has hypotension, fever, leukocytosis
   with ESBL pneumonia and acineobactor pneumonia.  Clinical picture
   consistent with pneumo-sepsis.  Now titrated off pressors and
   hemodynamically stable.  On [**Last Name (un) 430**] for ESBL klebsiella and Bactrim for
   acinetobacter PNA, and empiric dapto (?line, skin).
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
   -          levophed to keep MAPs>60
   -          fluid boluses PRN
   -          f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   -          hold antihypertensives, no lasix yet.
   2.       Respiratory failure.  Patient has pneumonia (ESBL klebsiella
   and acinetobacter), bilaterally pleural effusions, and b/l pneumonia.
   Was on pressure support overnight.  Unable to diurese at present due to
   low blood pressure, but will treat pneumonia with antibiotics and place
   pigtail catheter today.
                   -  [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, for pna
                   - wean off vent if possible
                  - pigtail catheter placement
   3.       Pleural effusion.  Patient has history of empyema
   bilaterally.  Now with pleural effusion, though patient continues to be
   in positive fluid balance.   Fever, wbc trending down, but requiring
   vent support off an on.  Will place pigtail today to improve
   respiratory status.
   -          Pigtail catheter palcement
   -          Hold on lasix/diuresis for now.
            4.  Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to SIADH.  Will free water
   restrict and check serial lytes.  Will avoid diuresis with lasix at
   present due to hypotension, but consider lasix diuresis in AM.
                  - minimize free water flushes
   - serial lytes
   4.        Nutrition.  Patient failed S&S.  Got PEG placement by IR.
                         - on tube feeds at goal
   5.  PVD.  Awaiting revascularization after discharge.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.
   - Further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - continue ASA and plavix
   7.  UTI.  Multiple ESBL Klebsiella species.  Sensitive to meropenem
   (last Klebs MIC panel pending).  Foley was changed after this urine
   culture specimen was obtained.
   8.   HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC.  Now volume up
   several days in a row with new pleural effusion.  Unable to diurese due
   to hypotension requiring pressors.
   - fluid as needed to maintain blood pressure
   9.  PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - continue low dose oxycodone
   - Fentanyl patch
   10.   EOSINOPHILIA.  S/p treatment of strongyloides with ivermectin,
   though only weakly positive antibody to strongyloides.  Suspect drug
   reaction, though offending [**Doctor Last Name **] remains unclear.  Tryptase wnl.
   - follow CBC with diff
   - f/u peripheral flow cytometry
   11.   P. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).  Currently in NSR in 80s.
   - hold Lopressor
   - not anticoagulating currently.
   12.  Hypothyroidism:  Continue Levothyroxine.
   13.  Thrush:  Clotrimazole troches QID.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Currently, the patient is in the ICU with ventilator-associated esophageal infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. The patient's current medications include meropenem, bactrim, and daptomycin.

The patient's medical complications include septic shock, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, hyponatremia, and potential strongyloidiasis. The patient also has chronic conditions such as atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and thrush. Additionally, the patient is experiencing acute pain and eosinophilia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of heart failure. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance, blood pressure, respiratory status, and antibiotic therapy will be crucial in preventing these complications."

   CT Abd [**10-29**]:
   1. Dilated stomach, small bowel and mild distention of proximal colon
   to the
   level of the hepatic flexure with air fluid levels and no clear small
   bowel
   transition point. Findings most likely represent ileus; early or
   partial
   small- bowel obstruction or colonic obstruction felt less likely.
   Rescanning
   after an appropriate interval to allow further passage of contrast may
   be
   helpful.
   2. Round fluid density in bilateral inguinal regions, right greater
   than
   left, most likely represents fluid in inguinal hernias as seen on
   previous
   CT. It is difficult to entirely exclude herniated small bowel on the
   right
   given limitations of the study.
   3. Bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions, right greater than
   left,
   slightly improved compared to the CT of [**2125-8-20**]. Pneumonia
   cannot be
   excluded.
   4. Hyperdense medullary pyramids may reflect medullary nephrocalcinosis
   and
   correlation is recommended.
   5. Extensive vascular calcifications.
   6. L1 compression fracture, age-indeterminate but unchanged compared to
   the
   CT of [**2125-8-20**].
   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non functioning G
   tube and concern on exam for an acute abdomen (obstruction vs
   perforation)

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. He is now back on TM ventilation
   - continue pulmonary toilet, will perform bronchoscopy if secretions
   are copious.
   - increase secretions: bloody, may need repeat bronch.
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This is likely from the free water we gave for the IV
   bactrim (which he has to receive given his NPO status.). He will cont
   free water restriction.  UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH as a
   component as well.  His Na has improved over the past 48 hrs. .
   >Hyperkalemia: stable renal function, . His CK is nl (no rhabdo),
   possibly [**1-20**] Bactrim.
   - urine lytes, CK
   > Leukocytosis and Fevers: ESBL Klebsiella  and acinetobacter from
   sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance pattern)  in urine which
   appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1 Meropenem. Blood cultures
   (including perip and PICC) have been negative on multiple assays.  He
   has multiple sites of skin break down including left knee cellulitis,
   toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all of which are largely
   stable at this point. He has been treated more recently for this
   cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c. dif.  Over the
   last two days his WBC has cont to improve.  The thoracentesis has a
   transdative fluid with pH 7.26 (220 WBC, 81% lymphs). Gram stain is
   negative
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  CK ok on daptomycin
   - S/p thoracentesis with removal of 1200 cc, does not appear infected
   >SBO/illeus: partial SBO on CT scan. [**Doctor First Name **] following, but conservative
   management for now NG tube to suction, holding feeds and narcotics,
   Stop metronidazole and advance bowel regimen. He is now moving his
   bowels
   - Follow lactate and check KUB
   - Follow up surgery recs.
   - Stop metronidazole iff KUB showing improvement.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF):
   - liberalize I/O goals in the setting of his fevers and SIRs/Sepsis

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - holding pain meds in the setting of his illeus
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis
 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:
   holding plavix pending resolution of possible SBO
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt
   Other issues per ICU resident note.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a recent hospital course complicated by respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and wound infection. He is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities and a complicated medical history.

The patient has been diagnosed with a partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is being managed conservatively with an NG tube to suction, holding feeds, and narcotics. There is no clear transition point seen on the CT scan, and the findings are more likely to represent ileus. The patient's bowel sounds are present, but he is distended and tender on abdominal examination.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/60 to 160/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high flow nasal cannula. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 28 mmHg, indicating fluid overload. The patient has received a total of 3,650 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an input-output balance of 2,540 mL.

The patient has been treated for multiple infections, including klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum, klebsiella in the urine, and left knee cellulitis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was originally admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy. The patient is currently experiencing klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum, klebsiella in his urine, and multiple areas of skin breakdown, which may explain recent fevers and hypotension. 

The patient's airway is compromised, as he is unable to protect it due to his tracheostomy and requires high cuff pressures with occasional leaks. He is being ventilated with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will undergo a bronchoscopy if secretions are copious. 

The patient has hyponatremia, possibly due to fluid shifts or SIADH, and hyperkalemia, which may be related to renal function or rhabdomyolysis. 

Leukocytosis and fevers are present, indicating an ongoing infection, likely caused by ESBL Klebsiella and acinetobacter from the sputum and klebsiella in the urine. 

The patient has multiple sites of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown, all of which are stable at this point.

   1. Dilated stomach, small bowel and mild distention of proximal colon
   to the
   level of the hepatic flexure with air fluid levels and no clear small
   bowel
   transition point. Findings most likely represent ileus; early or
   partial
   small- bowel obstruction or colonic obstruction felt less likely.
   Rescanning
   after an appropriate interval to allow further passage of contrast may
   be
   helpful.
   2. Round fluid density in bilateral inguinal regions, right greater
   than
   left, most likely represents fluid in inguinal hernias as seen on
   previous
   CT. It is difficult to entirely exclude herniated small bowel on the
   right
   given limitations of the study.
   3. Bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions, right greater than
   left,
   slightly improved compared to the CT of [**2125-8-20**]. Pneumonia
   cannot be
   excluded.
   4. Hyperdense medullary pyramids may reflect medullary nephrocalcinosis

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and tracheostomy. The patient currently has an acute abdomen, suspected small bowel obstruction or ileus, and is at risk for aspiration due to an ineffective airway clearance mechanism. He also has hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis, and fever. The patient's blood cultures have been negative, but he has Klebsiella and Acinetobacter in his sputum and urine. He has multiple skin breakdowns and is being treated with various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Small bowel obstruction or ileus: The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings suggest a partial small bowel obstruction or ileus. If left untreated, it may progress to complete obstruction or perforation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's recurrent infections and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis.
4. Skin breakdown and infection: The patient has multiple areas of skin breakdown, increasing the risk of infection and possible spread to deeper tissues.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an acute gastrointestinal obstruction (SBO). They have a history of allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics including meropenem, daptomycin, metronidazole, and bactrim. Vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/49 mmHg to 160/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 28 mmHg, total input of 3,650 mL, and total output of 1,110 mL. Fluid balance is positive at 2,540 mL. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is deferred due to PEEP > 10 cmH2O and RR > 35. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 48 mmHg,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient was admitted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Abdominal distension and suspected small bowel obstruction (SBO) versus bowel perforation.
   - Stat lactate, white blood cell count (WBC), and imaging studies such as KUB (kidneys, ureters, and bladder) and CT scan abdomen with PO contrast are recommended.
   - Surgery and interventional radiology (IR) consults are needed for further management.

2. Infection and shock.
   - Intermittent hypotension, fever, and leukocytosis indicate an ongoing infection.
   - The patient has been treated with antibiotics for ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia.
   - Close monitoring of blood cultures, fever curve, and WBC count is necessary.

3. Respiratory failure.
   - The patient has pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter.
   - Bilateral pleural effusions occurred after thoracentesis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has multifocal pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, small bowel obstruction versus ileus, infection/sepsis, respiratory failure with bilateral pleural effusions, hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, malnutrition, peripheral vascular disease, and a urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection/Sepsis: The patient has a baseline elevation of white blood cell count and is on antibiotics for both ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia. He also has intermittent hypotension and fever, indicating possible sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions, which can contribute to respiratory failure. His oxygen saturation is 100% on high-flow nasal cannula, and he is on mechanical ventilation support.
3. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). These imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Malnutrition: The patient has failed enteral feeding and has a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in place. Displacement"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and previously admitted for a wound infection. He was initially admitted for respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient has klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine, as well as multiple areas of skin breakdown. He has been experiencing fevers and hypotension, which are concerning for an acute abdomen (obstruction vs perforation). The patient has a non-functioning G-tube and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to the presence of pneumonia and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and aspiration.

2. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum, klebsiella in the urine, and skin breakdown. There is a risk of worsening or spreading these infections, potentially leading to sepsis.

3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has signs suggestive of an acute abdomen, possibly due to bowel obstruction or perforation. There is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or further complications related to the bowel obstruction.

4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of CAD"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD who was admitted for a wound infection. He has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient has klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine. He also has multiple areas of skin breakdown, leading to recent fevers and hypotension. The patient aspirated and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Sepsis: The patient's recurrent infections and fevers indicate a possible ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's hyperkalemia and potential hypovolemia may suggest AKI. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels may be due to fluid shifts or SIADH. Fluid restriction should be continued, and further evaluation is needed.
6. Bowel obstruction/ileus: The patient's CT scan shows a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, PVD, and previous respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement, and is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. His current conditions include distended abdomen due to partial small bowel obstruction or ileus, infection and shock with intermittent hypotension, fever, and leukocytosis, respiratory failure with pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, malnutrition, peripheral vascular disease, and urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Distended abdomen: The patient's distended abdomen may lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or infection if the partial small bowel obstruction progresses or if the ileus persists.
2. Infection and shock: The patient's symptoms of intermittent hypotension, fever, and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection, which could potentially lead to septic shock if not promptly treated.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. If left untreated or not adequately managed, it may result in worsening respiratory distress and potentially respiratory arrest.
4. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia: The patient's electrolyte imbalances need close monitoring and correction to avoid complications such as seizures, cardiac arrhythmias,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD who was admitted for a wound infection. The patient has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now presents with Klebsiella and Acinetobacter in the sputum, as well as Klebsiella in the urine. The patient also has multiple areas of skin breakdown.

The patient's current status includes:

1. Airway: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, with a risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex. He had a tracheostomy but still requires high cuff pressures and occasionally has a leak. He will be put back on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to increasing pleural effusions and bowel gas, which is likely impairing his ability to ventilate.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely due to fluid shifts (hypovolemia). This could be from the free water given for IV bactrim. The patient will continue free water restriction. UNa is 69, which argues for SIADH as a component as well. His Na has improved over the past 48 hours and remains stable.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia with stable renal function, possibly due to RTA. The patient's K levels will be closely monitored.

4. Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers due to ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter from sputum and Klebsiella in the urine. He has multiple sites of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown. These are largely stable at this point. He has been treated for this cellulitis with daptomycin. Notably negative for c. difficile. Over the last two days, his WBC has continued to improve. The thoracentesis shows a transudative fluid with pH 7.26 (220 WBC, 81% lymphs). Gram stain is negative.

5. SBO/Ileus: The patient has a partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) on CT scan. Conservative management will be followed, including NG tube to suction, holding feeds and narcotics, although initially moving his bowels on 10/31, this has stopped and he is now distended with minimal bowel sounds on exam. A repeat CT scan will be ordered to look for the evolution of SBO: transition point.

6. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient may have heart failure (CHF), and his I/O goals will be liberalized in the setting of his fevers and SIRS/Sepsis.

7. Pain Control: The patient's pain control is being held in the setting of his ileus.

8. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and metoprolol will be held in the setting of sepsis.

9. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has peripheral vascular disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia. Plavix will be held pending resolution of possible SBO.

10. Other issues per ICU resident note.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C
- Heart rate: 101 bpm
- Blood pressure: 122/53 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 92% on face tent
- Glasgow Coma Scale: Not mentioned
- General appearance: Thin
- Eyes/Conjunctiva: PERRL
- Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: NG tube, PEG C/D/I
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, diminished pulses in both lower extremities
- Respiratory/Chest: Crackles at the bases of both lungs
- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, distended, tender diffuse
- Extremities: Absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities
- Skin: Warm, dry
- Neurologic: Responds to verbal stimuli, purposeful movement, increased muscle tone

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to inability to protect airway and impaired ventilation.
2. Sepsis due to Klebsiella and Acinetobacter infections.
3. Small bowel obstruction/ileus with distention and possible perforation.
4. Heart failure (CHF) with fluid overload.
5. Hyperkalemia with potential for cardiac complications.
6. Hyponatremia with potential for neurological complications.
7. Skin breakdown with risk of infection and potential need for debridement or amputation.
8. Peripheral vascular disease with risk of critical limb ischemia.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details from the patient's medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests would be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   CT abdomen/pelvis:
   1. Dilated stomach, small bowel and mild distention of proximal colon
   to the
   level of the hepatic flexure with air fluid levels and no clear small
   bowel
   transition point. Findings most likely represent ileus; early or
   partial
   small- bowel obstruction or colonic obstruction felt less likely.
   Rescanning
   after an appropriate interval to allow further passage of contrast may
   be
   helpful.
   2. Round fluid density in bilateral inguinal regions, right greater
   than
   left, most likely represents fluid in inguinal hernias as seen on
   previous
   CT. It is difficult to entirely exclude herniated small bowel on the
   right
   given limitations of the study.
   3. Bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions, right greater than
   left,
   slightly improved compared to the CT of [**2125-8-20**]. Pneumonia
   cannot be
   excluded.
   4. Hyperdense medullary pyramids may reflect medullary nephrocalcinosis
   and
   correlation is recommended.
   5. Extensive vascular calcifications.
   6. L1 compression fracture, age-indeterminate but unchanged compared to

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. He is currently admitted with an infection caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, now with partial small bowel obstruction.

The patient's current symptoms include a distended abdomen, decreased stool output, and increased nasogastric tube output, which is concerning for progression to complete obstruction or ileus. His lactate levels are normal. He has also developed hypotension, which responded to fluid administration in the setting of narcotic use, and he has pneumonia but without signs of worsening sepsis. His pleural effusions have reaccumulated following thoracentesis, and he has significant abdominal distention. 

He has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). However, he cannot be free water restricted due to concern for small bowel obstruction. His nutritional status is poor, and he has failed enteral feeding, so a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement was done. However, given the concern for obstruction, he will remain nil per os (NPO).

The patient also has peripheral arterial disease with dry gangrene in the lower extremities and is awaiting revascularization after discharge. He has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella species, and yeast in the urine. 

His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis.

The imaging studies reveal findings consistent with ileus, early or partial small bowel obstruction, and colonic obstruction felt less likely. There are also signs of pneumonia, pleural effusions, and vascular calcifications.

The patient's medical plan includes discontinuing opioids, performing another CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for bowel obstruction, and starting pressure support. His antibiotic regimen will be continued for 14 days, and he will be monitored for any changes in his condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, PVD, and recent respiratory failure. He has tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in place. The patient is currently being treated for an infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. He is also experiencing partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), ileus, pneumonia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and worsening pulmonary edema. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management due to multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's distended abdomen, decreased stool output, and increased nasogastric tube output suggest a partial SBO. This could progress to complete obstruction if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, cough, and worsening bilateral pleural effusions indicates an ongoing infection. The patient is already being treated for ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The worsening pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions may be contributing to the patient's respiratory failure. Diuretics may be necessary to manage this condition.
4. Hyponatremia: The low sodium levels suggest a possible syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). However, fluid restriction is challenging due to the concern for SBO.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who presented with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient developed partial small bowel obstruction (SBO), and his abdominal distention has worsened. He also has hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and a possible displacement of the PEG tube. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bilateral pleural effusions, and a compression fracture of L1. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics and has been weaned off the ventilator. He is currently being treated for yeast in the urine and sputum.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection/Septic Shock: The patient has shown signs of infection, including fever and leukocytosis, along with pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. This may lead to septic shock, which is characterized by hypotension and inadequate tissue perfusion.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Although he has been weaned off the ventilator, there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if the pneumonia worsens or if there are complications such as"

   PFI: Progression of oral contrast to the rectum, with no evidence of
   obstruction. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
   consolidation.
   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non functioning G
   tube and concern on exam for an acute abdomen (obstruction vs
   perforation)

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. We will need to put him back on
   PSV given increasing effusions and bowel gas which is likely impairing
   his ability to ventilate. We will need to restart VC ventilation
   pending resolution of the effusions/illeus/volume overload as he is
   increasingly tachypneic.
   - continue pulmonary toilet,
   - increase secretions: bloody, which were consistent with volume
   overload on bronch [**11-1**]
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This is likely from the free water we gave for the IV
   bactrim (which he has to receive given his NPO status.). He will cont
   free water restriction.  UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH as a
   component as well.  His Na has improved and remains stable.
   > Leukocytosis and Fevers/Hypotension: ESBL Klebsiella  and
   acinetobacter from sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance
   pattern)  in urine which appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1
   Meropenem. Blood cultures (including perip and PICC) have been negative
   on multiple assays.  He has multiple sites of skin break down including
   left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all
   of which are largely stable at this point. He has been treated more
   recently for this cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c.
   dif.  Over the last two days his WBC has cont to improve.  The
   thoracentesis has a transdative fluid with pH 7.26 (220 WBC, 81%
   lymphs). Gram stain is negative.
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  CK ok on daptomycin
   - S/p thoracentesis with removal of 1200 cc, does not appear infected
   - Fluconazole 3 day course for  yeast in mulltipe sources (started
   [**10-31**]) [**11-2**] is last day
   > Hypotension: He has been increasingly hypotensive over the past day
   despite elevated BNP (>4000), transfusion of 1U PRBC [**11-1**]. At this
   point we remained concerned for infection with no obv source. His
   elevated BNP is suggestive of heart  failure and he may have an over
   stretched LV. Will check a TTE and consider a trial of diuresis. In
   addition we need to consider adrenal insufficiency, although he is not
   currently on steroids he has been in the past ([**9-11**])
   - TTE
   - Consider empiric trial of diuresis
   - Check random cortisol
   >Illeus: partial SBO on CT scan. [**Doctor First Name **] following, but conservative
   management for now NG tube to suction, holding feeds and narcotics, he
   seems to have had an illeus which had improved on subsequent CT abd
   [**11-1**] with transition of contrast to the rectum
   - Follow up surgery recs, appreciate input.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - holding pain meds in the setting of his illeus
   > Rash:  appears morbiliform, the only new suspect medication is
   fluconazole which we are finishing a course for today. We will cont to
   follow.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:
   holding plavix pending resolution of possible SBO
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was originally admitted for a wound infection and has since developed respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and underwent a tracheostomy. The patient's current condition includes multiple areas of skin breakdown, hypotension, leukocytosis, and fevers. The note mentions the following potential medical complications:

1. Airway Compromise: The patient has an inability to protect his airway due to his tracheostomy and the presence of a non-functioning G tube.

2. Aspiration Risk: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to his altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely caused by fluid shifts and free water administration.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, indicating an infection, possibly due to ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter in the sputum and Klebsiella in the urine.

5. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension despite elevated BNP levels and transfusion of PRBCs.

6. Possible Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal insufficiency, as suggested by his elevated BNP levels and previous steroid use.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and previous bowel perforation. He was admitted for a wound infection and has since developed respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now presents with Klebsiella and Acinetobacter infections in his sputum and urine, as well as multiple areas of skin breakdown. The patient has undergone a tracheostomy but still requires high cuff pressures and occasionally has a leak. He also has a non-functioning G-tube and concerns for an acute abdomen, possibly due to obstruction or perforation. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis, and fevers. His renal function is stable, but he has a RTA and will continue to follow renal function and potassium levels. Blood cultures have been negative. The patient has multiple sites of skin breakdown, including left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene, and Achilles tendon breakdown. He has been treated with daptomycin for cellulitis, and there is no evidence of C. difficile infection. 

The patient's WBC count is improving, and a thoracentesis showed a transudative fluid with a pH of 7.26, 220 WBC, and 81% lymphs. The Gram stain is negative. The patient has been started on meropenem for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previously admitted for wound infection. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy due to klebsiella and acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in urine. The patient also has multiple areas of skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Compromise: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, as evidenced by his need for a tracheostomy and occasional leakage around the tracheostomy tube. There is a risk for aspiration and impaired airway clearance.
2. Sepsis: The patient has recurrent episodes of sepsis, likely due to klebsiella and acinetobacter infections in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which could be related to fluid shifts, possibly hypovolemia, and/or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia, which may be due to renal dysfunction or a renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non functioning G
   tube and concern on exam for an acute abdomen (obstruction vs
   perforation)

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. We will need to put him back on
   PSV given increasing effusions and bowel gas which is likely impairing
   his ability to ventilate. We will need to restart VC ventilation
   pending resolution of the effusions/illeus/volume overload as he is
   increasingly tachypneic.
   - continue pulmonary toilet,
   - increase secretions: bloody, which were consistent with volume
   overload on bronch [**11-1**]
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This is likely from the free water we gave for the IV
   bactrim (which he has to receive given his NPO status.). He will cont
   free water restriction.  UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH as a
   component as well.  His Na has improved and remains stable.
   > Leukocytosis and Fevers/Hypotension: ESBL Klebsiella  and
   acinetobacter from sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance
   pattern)  in urine which appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1
   Meropenem. Blood cultures (including perip and PICC) have been negative
   on multiple assays.  He has multiple sites of skin break down including
   left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all
   of which are largely stable at this point. He has been treated more
   recently for this cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c.
   dif.  Over the last two days his WBC has cont to improve.  The
   thoracentesis has a transdative fluid with pH 7.26 (220 WBC, 81%
   lymphs). Gram stain is negative.
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  CK ok on daptomycin
   - S/p thoracentesis with removal of 1200 cc, does not appear infected
   - Fluconazole 3 day course for  yeast in mulltipe sources (started
   [**10-31**]) [**11-2**] is last day
   > Hypotension: He has been increasingly hypotensive over the past day
   despite elevated BNP (>4000), transfusion of 1U PRBC [**11-1**]. At this
   point we remained concerned for infection with no obv source. His
   elevated BNP is suggestive of heart  failure and he may have an over
   stretched LV. Will check a TTE and consider a trial of diuresis. In
   addition we need to consider adrenal insufficiency, although he is not
   currently on steroids he has been in the past ([**9-11**])
   - TTE
   - Consider empiric trial of diuresis
   - Check random cortisol
   >Illeus: partial SBO on CT scan. [**Doctor First Name **] following, but conservative
   management for now NG tube to suction, holding feeds and narcotics, he
   seems to have had an illeus which had improved on subsequent CT abd
   [**11-1**] with transition of contrast to the rectum
   - Follow up surgery recs, appreciate input.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - holding pain meds in the setting of his illeus
   > Rash:  appears morbiliform, the only new suspect medication is
   fluconazole which we are finishing a course for today. We will cont to
   follow.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:
   holding plavix pending resolution of possible SBO
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and recent hospitalization for wound infection. He was admitted with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient has multiple medical complications, including airway issues due to tracheostomy problems, hyponatremia, leukocytosis with fevers and hypotension, possible ileus or bowel obstruction, skin breakdown, and a recent rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Complications: The patient has had issues with his tracheostomy, including leakage and the need for high cuff pressures. This may affect his ability to protect his airway and ventilate properly.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can be caused by fluid shifts or excessive free water intake. This condition can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and fevers, indicating a possible infection. The presence of ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter in his sputum and urine suggests a bacterial infection that may be resistant to certain antibiotics.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been increasingly hypotensive despite receiving a blood transfusion. This could be due to se"

   Acineotbacter pna now with partial SBO.
   # Distended abdomen.  Patient developed distended, tympanitic abdomen
   on [**10-30**].  More recently having decreased stool output and increased
   NGT output, which is concerning for progression to complete obstruction
   versus ileus.  Will check another CT abd/pelvis today.  Lactate normal
   today.
   - trend lactate, wbc
   - cont NPO with IVF , hold on TFs
   - d/c bowel regimen for now while we await CT abd/pelvis results

   - d/c opioids
   Hypotension.  Patient had episode of hypotension yesterday which
   responded to fluids in the setting of narcotic use.  Though has
   pneumonia, clinical exam is not suggestive of worsening sepsis.   She
   has been off pressors for several days.  She is off [**Last Name (un) 430**] for ESBL

   Respiratory failure.  Patient has Pneumonia (ESBL klebsiella and
   acinetobacter), worsening bilateral pleural effusions that have
   reaccumlated following thoracentis, and significant of abdominal
   distention.  Bronch this morning consistent with CHF/pulmonary edema,
   though unable to diurese due to concern for SBO.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and respiratory failure with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient has been diagnosed with an infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species, and is currently being treated with antibiotics.

The patient's recent events include a distended abdomen, decreased stool output, increased nasogastric tube (NGT) output, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, pneumonia, worsening bilateral pleural effusions, significant abdominal distention, and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition is concerning for progression to complete small bowel obstruction (SBO) or ileus.

The assessment and plan for the patient include monitoring lactate levels, withholding oral intake with intravenous fluids, discontinuing bowel regimen until CT abdomen/pelvis results are available, stopping opioids, and following up with a cardiologist for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include worsening respiratory failure due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema, development of acute kidney injury due to hyperkalemia, progression to complete SBO leading to bowel ischemia or perforation, and septic shock due to ongoing infection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's bronchoscopic examination showed pulmonary edema, which is a condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to difficulty in breathing and decreased oxygen saturation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, with readings in the 80s systolic. Hypotension can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs and may indicate circulatory failure or shock.

3. Bilateral Pleural Effusions: The CT scan revealed persistent bilateral pleural effusions, which are collections of fluid around the lungs. These effusions can compress the lung tissue and impair lung function.

4. Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's symptoms, including abdominal distention, absence of bowel movements, and oral contrast not reaching the rectum on CT scan, suggest a possible bowel obstruction. SBO can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.

5. Rash: The patient has a diffuse erythematous rash on their body. This could be due to an allergic reaction or drug-induced hypersensitivity.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low at 130 mEq/L. Hyponatremia can lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, muscle weakness, and nausea.

7. Thrombocytopenia:"

   In brief, this is a 75M with CAD s/p BMS, CHF, COPD, pleural effusions,
   PVD s/p femeral endarterectomy and fem to posterior tibial bypass with
   saphenous vein graft [**2125-5-28**] who was admitted [**8-4**] with a Right Lower
   extremity MRSA surgical wound infection.  He has had a complicated
   hospital course, summarized as follows.
   He was initially treated with Vancomycin, however, developed an
   exfoliative rash to this medication.  He completed a treatment course
   with Linezolid and Unasyn.  He developed pancytopenia during this
   time.   Heme was consulted; it was thought to be secondary to
   Linezolid.  PF4Ab was negative for HIT. He also developed ARF and a
   NSTEMI during this time; his renal function is now normal.
   .
   On [**2125-8-24**] the patient developed confusion thought to be delerium.  On
   [**8-25**] he was transfused 2 units PRBCs for Hct of 24.
   On [**8-26**] he was found to be unresponsive, with T = 92 degrees, BP 44/P,
   HR 82; Code blue was called; and he was intubated.  He was noted to
   have necrotic  L toes, necrotic calcaneous, as well as having thick
   bloody secretions.  His sputum ultimately grew Klebsiella. He was
   treated initially with Daptomyin, ceftaz, and fluconazole; then
   ceftriaxone from [**Date range (1) 5437**] then meropenem started on [**8-31**] (due to MIC
   levels) for a planned 10 day course (last day planned as: [**9-6**]).  A R
   pigtail chest tube was placed for his pleural effusions.  He was
   treated with stress dose steroids. TFT's consistant with hypothyroid--
   endocrine was consulted and levothyroxine was started.
   .
   He was extubated on [**8-29**] and called out of the unit on [**8-30**]. He was
   started on a heparin gtt on [**9-1**].  A L pigtail catheter attempted but
   not able to be placed [**9-4**]; the R pigtail was adjusted at that time.
   .
   On the evening prior to transfer to the MICU, the patient had an
   episode of respiratory distress with hypertension to 190's/100's.  He
   was reportedly ""cyanotic"" and had blue fingertips, however, an O2 sat
   was unable to be obtained.  ABG around that time was 7.44/51/60/36.
   He was started on a nonrebreather, given lasix/diamox and metoprolol.
   His pigtail was TPA'd and put out several hundred cc's.  His
   respiratory status then improved and he was weaned to 2L NC.  (Of note,
   his I/Os were 1.6/.6 overnight).
   His temp was 100.3-100.7 axillary from 11:00 PM until this morning.
   .
   The morning of admission, the patient's blood pressure fell from 110s
   to 80s.  His temp was 100.7 axillary. He received Normal saline 500 ml
   bolus with improvement in his blood pressure from 80s--> 110s systolic
   and was transferred to the MICU for further care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PVD, and previous MRSA surgical wound infection. He was admitted for a right lower extremity MRSA surgical wound infection and has had a complicated hospital course. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including vancomycin, linezolid, unsusyn, and daptomycin. He developed pancytopenia and an exfoliative rash to vancomycin. He also had acute respiratory distress, a non-functioning G-tube, and multiple areas of skin breakdown. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and a possible small bowel obstruction (SBO). He is currently on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension, absent bowel sounds, and coffee ground output from the NG tube suggest the possibility of SBO. Further evaluation and management should be done to confirm the diagnosis and alleviate the obstruction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to his underlying COPD and recent episodes of respiratory distress. Continued support with NIPPV and careful monitoring are necessary. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to his poor lung function and potential klebsiella infection.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient"

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pleural effusions, peripheral vascular disease, and previous femoral endarterectomy and femoral-to-posterior tibial bypass with saphenous vein graft. He was admitted with a right lower extremity MRSA surgical wound infection. The patient has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place.

The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, worsening abdominal exam, and worsening respiratory status. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 101.3°F, blood pressure 142/64 mmHg, heart rate 94 bpm, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. The patient is sedated but responds to noxious stimuli.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, elevated blood glucose levels, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 123 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever/HOTN: The patient is likely septic, possibly due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, line infection, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, sinusitis, wound infection, or Clostridioides difficile infection.
   - Continue Meropenem for ESBL Klebsiella in sputum (21-day course) and Bactrim for Acinetobacter (21-day course).
   - Check sputum culture, including fungal, and stool for C-diff.
   - Continue to wean levophed as tolerated.

   endocrine was consulted and levothyroxine was started.
   .
   He was extubated on [**8-29**] and called out of the unit on [**8-30**]. He was
   started on a heparin gtt on [**9-1**].  A L pigtail catheter attempted but
   not able to be placed [**9-4**]; the R pigtail was adjusted at that time.
   .
   On the evening prior to transfer to the MICU, the patient had an
   episode of respiratory distress with hypertension to 190's/100's.  He
   was reportedly ""cyanotic"" and had blue fingertips, however, an O2 sat
   was unable to be obtained.  ABG around that time was 7.44/51/60/36.
   He was started on a nonrebreather, given lasix/diamox and metoprolol.
   His pigtail was TPA'd and put out several hundred cc's.  His
   respiratory status then improved and he was weaned to 2L NC.  (Of note,
   his I/Os were 1.6/.6 overnight).
   His temp was 100.3-100.7 axillary from 11:00 PM until this morning.
   .
   The morning of admission, the patient's blood pressure fell from 110s
   to 80s.  His temp was 100.7 axillary. He received Normal saline 500 ml
   bolus with improvement in his blood pressure from 80s--> 110s systolic
   and was transferred to the MICU for further care.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non functioning G
   tube and concern on exam for an acute abdomen (obstruction vs
   perforation)

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH) - s/p tracheostomy: on TM again today. We
   performed a trach change [**10-27**] but he still is requiring high cuff
   pressures and occasionally has a leak. We will need to put him back on
   PSV given increasing effusions and bowel gas which is likely impairing
   his ability to ventilate. We will need to restart VC ventilation
   pending resolution of the effusions/illeus/volume overload as he is
   increasingly tachypneic.
   - continue pulmonary toilet,
   - increase secretions: bloody, which were consistent with volume
   overload on bronch [**11-1**]
   > Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This is likely from the free water we gave for the IV
   bactrim (which he has to receive given his NPO status.). He will cont
   free water restriction.  UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH as a
   component as well.  His Na has improved and remains stable.
   > Leukocytosis and Fevers/Hypotension: ESBL Klebsiella  and
   acinetobacter from sputum and Klebsiella (of similar resistance
   pattern)  in urine which appears to be an ESBL as well. [**10-25**] = Day 1
   Meropenem. Blood cultures (including perip and PICC) have been negative
   on multiple assays.  He has multiple sites of skin break down including
   left knee cellulitis, toe gangrene and Achilles tendon break down all
   of which are largely stable at this point. He has been treated more
   recently for this cellulitis with daptomycin.   Notably negative for c.
   dif.  Over the last two days his WBC has cont to improve.  The
   thoracentesis has a transdative fluid with pH 7.26 (220 WBC, 81%
   lymphs). Gram stain is negative.
   - Meropenem ([**10-25**]) day 1 for 14 day course for GNR urine, Klebsiella
   and Bactrim (changed to IV) for acinetobacter (pending [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) **] on
   sputum sample)
   - [**10-27**] empiric gram positive coverage given hemodynamic stability.  He
   has a linez and Vanco allergy. He has a remote hx of coag neg staph
   [**9-18**] and recently empirically treated for left sided cellulitis with
   many areas of profound skin ulceration.  Will need to follow renal
   function closely.  CK ok on daptomycin
   - S/p thoracentesis with removal of 1200 cc, does not appear infected
   - Fluconazole 3 day course for  yeast in mulltipe sources (started
   [**10-31**]) [**11-2**] is last day
   > Hypotension: He has been increasingly hypotensive over the past day
   despite elevated BNP (>4000), transfusion of 1U PRBC [**11-1**]. At this
   point we remained concerned for infection with no obv source. His
   elevated BNP is suggestive of heart  failure and he may have an over
   stretched LV. Will check a TTE and consider a trial of diuresis. In
   addition we need to consider adrenal insufficiency, although he is not
   currently on steroids he has been in the past ([**9-11**])
   - TTE
   - Consider empiric trial of diuresis
   - Check random cortisol
   >Illeus: partial SBO on CT scan. [**Doctor First Name **] following, but conservative
   management for now NG tube to suction, holding feeds and narcotics, he
   seems to have had an illeus which had improved on subsequent CT abd
   [**11-1**] with transition of contrast to the rectum
   - Follow up surgery recs, appreciate input.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   - holding pain meds in the setting of his illeus
   > Rash:  appears morbiliform, the only new suspect medication is
   fluconazole which we are finishing a course for today. We will cont to
   follow.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of sepsis

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:
   holding plavix pending resolution of possible SBO

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a history of alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU with a right lower extremity MRSA surgical wound infection. 

During his hospital course, the patient developed several complications. He initially received vancomycin but developed an exfoliative rash, so he was switched to linezolid and unusyn. However, he developed pancytopenia, which was thought to be secondary to linezolid. He also developed acute respiratory failure (ARF) and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). His renal function is now normal.

On 8/24/2125, the patient developed confusion and was thought to be delirious. On 8/25, he received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a hematocrit of 24. On 8/26, he became unresponsive, with a temperature of 92 degrees, blood pressure of 44/P, and heart rate of 82. A code blue was called, and he was intubated. He was found to have necrotic toes and calcaneous, as well as thick bloody secretions. His sputum grew Klebsiella. He was treated with daptomycin, ceftazidime, and fluconazole, then ceftriaxone from 8/31, and meropenem started on 8/31 due to MIC levels for a planned 10-day course.

The patient had a right pigtail chest tube placed for pleural effusions and received stress dose steroids. His thyroid function tests were consistent with hypothyroidism, and he started on levothyroxine. He was extubated on 8/29 and called out of the unit on 8/30. He was started on a heparin drip on 9/1. A left pigtail catheter attempted but was not able to be placed on 9/4; the right pigtail was adjusted at that time.

On the evening prior to transfer to the MICU, the patient had an episode of respiratory distress with hypertension to 190's/100's. He was reportedly ""cyanotic"" and had blue fingertips, but an oxygen saturation (O2 sat) was unable to be obtained. An arterial blood gas (ABG) around that time showed pH 7.44, PaCO2 51, PaO2 60, and HCO3- 36. He was started on a nonrebreather, given lasix/diamox, and metoprolol. His pigtail was thrombolytic therapy (TPA'd) and drained several hundred cc's"

   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non functioning G
   tube and concern for partial SBO
   1. SBO
 exam somewhat improved. NPO. NGT on suction. Minimized
   narcotics. BS are present. However, now there is coffee ground output
   from NG tube.
   -Will d/w surgery re: resuming TF slowly
   -NGT to intermittent suction to minimize trauma
   -Resume PPI (IV while NPO)
   2. Resp failure
 PNA, effusions/volume overload. Convert to PSV.
   3. Fever/HOTN
 likely sepsis in the setting of recurrent fevers.
   Sources of infection: PNA with ? necrotizing component (no recent
   sputum
 will check), UTI (Cx pending) line (Cx pending), pancreatitis
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6505**] [**Doctor First Name **]/lip, but pancreas looked normal on I- CT), cholecystitis
   (but GB looked normal on I- CT); sinusitis (but no nasal drainage
   observed), wound infection (but wounds are clean), c-diff (will check c
   diff toxin). Non infectious causes include adrenal insufficiency
   (hyponatremia, eosinophlia, recent steroids) and drug reaction
   (eosinophilia, rash)
   -Continue Meropenem for ESBL Klebs in sputum (21 day course) and
   Bactrim for acenitobacter (21 day course)
   - Consider d/c Dapto in next 24 hrs if cx remain neg
   -Continue to wean levophed as tol
   -Continue hydrocort
   -Check sputum cx (including fungal) and stool for c-diff
   4. Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This is likely from the free water we gave for the IV
   bactrim (which he has to receive given his NPO status.). He will cont
   free water restriction.  UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH as a
   component as well. Adrenal insuff?.  His Na has improved and remains
   stable.

   fluconazole which we finished yesterday. We will cont to follow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of CAD, PVD, COPD, CHF, and previous MRSA surgical wound infection. He was admitted with right lower extremity MRSA surgical wound infection and developed respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is now on TM. He has recurrent sepsis, fever, hypotension, and multiple areas of skin breakdown. The patient's recent hospital course includes aspiration, non-functioning G-tube, concern for partial SBO, and coffee ground output from NG tube. The patient has hyponatremia, eosinophilia, and rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has been diagnosed with partial SBO and is currently NPO. The NGT is on suction to minimize trauma, and PPI will be resumed while the patient is NPO. The patient's condition will be closely monitored for any further signs of SBO.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia, effusions/volume overload. The plan is to convert to pressure support ventilation (PSV) to assist with breathing.
3. Fever/Hypotension: The patient has recurrent fevers, indicating potential sepsis. Sources of infection include pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), central line infection, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, sinusitis, wound infection, and Clostridium difficile ("

   In brief, this is a 75M with CAD s/p BMS, CHF, COPD, pleural effusions,
   PVD s/p femeral endarterectomy and fem to posterior tibial bypass with
   saphenous vein graft [**2125-5-28**] who was admitted [**8-4**] with a Right Lower
   extremity MRSA surgical wound infection.  He has had a complicated
   hospital course, summarized as follows.
   He was initially treated with Vancomycin, however, developed an
   exfoliative rash to this medication.  He completed a treatment course
   with Linezolid and Unasyn.  He developed pancytopenia during this
   time.   Heme was consulted; it was thought to be secondary to
   Linezolid.  PF4Ab was negative for HIT. He also developed ARF and a
   NSTEMI during this time; his renal function is now normal.
   .
   On [**2125-8-24**] the patient developed confusion thought to be delerium.  On
   [**8-25**] he was transfused 2 units PRBCs for Hct of 24.
   On [**8-26**] he was found to be unresponsive, with T = 92 degrees, BP 44/P,
   HR 82; Code blue was called; and he was intubated.  He was noted to
   have necrotic  L toes, necrotic calcaneous, as well as having thick
   bloody secretions.  His sputum ultimately grew Klebsiella. He was
   treated initially with Daptomyin, ceftaz, and fluconazole; then
   ceftriaxone from [**Date range (1) 5437**] then meropenem started on [**8-31**] (due to MIC
   levels) for a planned 10 day course (last day planned as: [**9-6**]).  A R
   pigtail chest tube was placed for his pleural effusions.  He was
   treated with stress dose steroids. TFT's consistant with hypothyroid--
   endocrine was consulted and levothyroxine was started.
   .
   He was extubated on [**8-29**] and called out of the unit on [**8-30**]. He was
   started on a heparin gtt on [**9-1**].  A L pigtail catheter attempted but
   not able to be placed [**9-4**]; the R pigtail was adjusted at that time.
   .
   On the evening prior to transfer to the MICU, the patient had an
   episode of respiratory distress with hypertension to 190's/100's.  He
   was reportedly ""cyanotic"" and had blue fingertips, however, an O2 sat
   was unable to be obtained.  ABG around that time was 7.44/51/60/36.
   He was started on a nonrebreather, given lasix/diamox and metoprolol.
   His pigtail was TPA'd and put out several hundred cc's.  His
   respiratory status then improved and he was weaned to 2L NC.  (Of note,
   his I/Os were 1.6/.6 overnight).
   His temp was 100.3-100.7 axillary from 11:00 PM until this morning.
   .
   The morning of admission, the patient's blood pressure fell from 110s
   to 80s.  His temp was 100.7 axillary. He received Normal saline 500 ml
   bolus with improvement in his blood pressure from 80s--> 110s systolic
   and was transferred to the MICU for further care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PVD, and previous MRSA surgical wound infection. He was admitted with a Right Lower extremity MRSA surgical wound infection and has had a complicated hospital course. The patient has developed several medical complications, including pancytopenia, ARF, NSTEMI, delirium, necrotic toes, pleural effusions, and respiratory failure. He has been treated with multiple antibiotics and has shown improvement but continues to have ongoing fevers and hypotension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, has a tracheostomy, and is receiving IV fluids and medications. He is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient's abdominal exam shows distension, and there is concern for partial SBO. He is NPO, with an NG tube on suction, and will be closely monitored.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia and pleural effusions, which have contributed to his respiratory failure. He will be switched to pressure control ventilation (PCV) mode.
3. Fever and hypotension (sepsis): The patient has recurrent fevers, suggesting ongoing infection. Possible sources include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, line infection, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, sinusitis, wound infection, and Clostridium difficile infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of recent hospitalization for pneumonia. The patient has been kept NPO to monitor for ileus and potential small bowel obstruction (pSBO). An echocardiogram was performed to assess for worsening systolic dysfunction, revealing an ejection fraction of 55%, mildly dilated right ventricle, preserved global biventricular systolic function, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Cortisol level was checked and found to be 20.

The patient's temperature is currently 101°F, and he is pan-cultured. His increasing pressor requirements were discussed with the family, and it was decided to try another pressor if needed. IV hydrocortisone is being started every 6 hours.

The patient has allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. His last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole on 10/31/2125 at 08:00 AM, fluconazole on 11/1/2125 at 12:00 PM, daptomycin on 11/2/2125 at 09:46 PM, meropenem on 11/3/2125 at 02:00 AM, and Bactrim (SMX/TMP) on 11/3/2125 at 06:19 AM.

The patient is receiving midazolam (V"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient's recent events include being kept NPO to monitor for ileus and possible small bowel obstruction (SBO), undergoing an echocardiogram to assess for worsening systolic dysfunction, having a cortisol level checked, and making a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision with the family. The patient has been experiencing a fever and increasing pressor requirements.

The patient has allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. His last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole on 10/31/2125 at 8:00 AM, fluconazole on 11/1/2125 at 12:00 PM, daptomycin on 11/2/2125 at 9:46 PM, and meropenem on 11/3/2125 at 2:00 AM. He is currently receiving midazolam and norepinephrine infusions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C), blood pressure of 142/64 mmHg, heart rate of 94 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His review of systems is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. He has been diagnosed with ileus, which is causing abdominal distention. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, fever, and increasing pressor requirements, suggesting the possibility of septic shock. His cortisol level is low, indicating potential adrenal insufficiency. He also has hyponatremia, likely due to SIADH, and is unable to free water restrict due to concern for small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for nutrition support but remains NPO due to ileus concerns. He has dry gangrene in his left lower extremities and is awaiting revascularization. The patient's medications include IV hydrocortisone, broad-spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole, fluconazole, daptomycin, meropenem, and Bactrim), midazolam, norepinephrine, morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications.

   Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension yesterday requiring
   re-initiation of pressors.  WBC is mildly rising but not febrile.
   Remains on broad spectrum antibiotics but exam is not consistent with
   worsening sepsis.  Given eleveated BNP, will evaluate echo and consider
   diuresis with lasix drip.

   - echo to assess cardiac function today
   Respiratory failure.  Patient has Pneumonia (ESBL klebsiella and
   acinetobacter), worsening bilateral pleural effusions that have
   reaccumlated following thoracentis, and significant of abdominal
   distention.  Bronch yesterday  consistent with CHF/pulmonary edema,
   though unable to diurese due to concern for SBO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD who was admitted for a wound infection of the foot. He has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy with klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum. He also has klebsiella in his urine and multiple areas of skin breakdown. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics and has shown improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of recurrent sepsis and current presence of klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum indicate a high risk for sepsis.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension and fever could be suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, especially if the sepsis is not responding to antibiotics.
3. Anaphylactoid reaction: The patient's rash, which improved after discontinuing certain medications, suggests the possibility of an anaphylactoid reaction.
4. Partial small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient's distended abdomen and dilated bowel loops on KUB indicate a potential ileus or partial SBO.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and ongoing ventilatory support pose a risk for continued respiratory failure.
6. Effusions and volume overload: The patient's"

   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection, subsequent long hospital course with
   respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy on
   TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in the
   urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to explain recent
   fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non functioning G
   tube and concern for partial SBO
   1.  Fever/HOTN
 likely sepsis in the setting of recurrent fevers.
   Sources of infection: PNA with ? necrotizing component (no recent
   sputum
 will BAL), UTI (Cx pending) line (Cx pending), pancreatitis
   ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6505**] [**Doctor First Name **]/lip, but pancreas looked normal on I- CT), cholecystitis
   (but GB looked normal on I- CT); sinusitis (but no nasal drainage
   observed), wound infection (but wounds are clean), c-diff (will check c
   diff toxin). Non infectious causes include adrenal insufficiency
   (hyponatremia, eosinophlia, recent steroids) and drug reaction
   (eosinophilia, rash)
   -Continue Meropenem for ESBL Klebs in sputum (21 day course) and
   Bactrim for acenitobacter (21 day course) BAL tonight was done and
   purulent drainage from RLL but no obstructing mass. Follow up CX
   -Continue to wean levophed as tol
   -Continue hydrocort
   -Check sputum cx (including fungal) and stool for c-diff
   2. SBO
 exam somewhat improved. NPO. NGT on suction. Minimized
   narcotics. BS are present. However, now there is coffee ground output
   from NG tube.-Will d/w surgery re: resuming TF slowly -NGT to
   intermittent suction to minimize trauma
   -Resume PPI (IV while NPO)
   3. Resp failure
 PNA, effusions/volume overload. Convert to PSV after
   bronch and watch closely.
   4. Hyponatremia: possible a reflection of fluid shifts (likely [**1-20**]
   hypovolemia.). This is likely from the free water we gave for the IV
   bactrim (which he has to receive given his NPO status.). He will cont
   free water restriction.  UNa is 69 which argues for SIADH as a
   component as well. Adrenal insuff?.  His Na has improved and remains
   stable.
   5. Rash:  appears morbiliform, the only new suspect medication was
   fluconazole which we finished yesterday. We will cont to follow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now presents with klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum, as well as klebsiella in the urine. The patient also has multiple areas of skin breakdown. He recently aspirated and has a non-functioning G tube, with concern for partial small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient's fever and hypotension are likely due to sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has recurrent fevers, hypotension, and positive cultures for klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum and urine, indicating a potential source of infection. The cause of the sepsis could be pneumonia, urinary tract infection, line infection, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, sinusitis, wound infection, or Clostridium difficile infection.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a partial SBO, which can lead to abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Coffee ground output from the NG tube suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to the SBO.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and previous bowel perforation (BPG). He was admitted for a wound infection and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications that can arise.

1. Fever/HOTN: The patient had fevers and hypotension, suggesting possible sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, anaphylactoid reaction, or drug fever. The fever has since defervesced, and the patient is no longer on pressors without any new antibiotics and after discontinuing fluconazole. The rash also improved when the suspected medication reaction was stopped. No other apparent source of infection has been identified.

2. Ileus: The patient's bowel sounds are present, but he is experiencing more distension and dilated bowel loops on KUB today after restarting tube feeds and low doses of opiates for pain. The nasogastric tube (NGT) output is minimal. The plan is to stop tube feeds and opiates for now, monitor the exam closely, and switch NGT to intermittent suction.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia, effusions, and volume overload. The plan is to convert to pressure support ventilation (PSV) after bronchoscopy and watch closely.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species. He also has an ileus, hypotension, and worsening temperatures, suggesting possible septic shock. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/54 mmHg to 144/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. His lung compliance is 35.7 cmH2O/mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 6.2 to 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level ranging from 25.1% to 30.6 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 351 to 497 K/uL, creatinine level ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 mg/dL, and blood glucose"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species, along with ileus. The patient's current condition includes worsening distention and tenderness, hypotension, coffee-ground emesis, and bronchospasm. He is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 96/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Complications:
   - Ileus: The patient has a distended and tympanitic abdomen, indicating a possible ileus. This can lead to further complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or infection.
   - Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The presence of coffee grounds in the nasogastric tube suggests ongoing UGIB. If not managed appropriately, it can result in significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
  
2. Respiratory Complications:
   - Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species. If not treated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF). 

From the 24-hour events section of the note, we can gather the following information:
- Coffee grounds in the nasogastric tube (NGT) were observed during rounds, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The hematocrit (Hct) levels were stable, fluctuating between 26.9 and 27.7.
- The patient's requirement for pressors was successfully weaned off by midnight.
- The ventilator mode was changed to pressure-controlled synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (PSV) with a set volume of 500 mL, pressure support of 12 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
- Sputum culture results were contaminated, and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample was sent for analysis.
- Clostridium difficile (C. diff) testing was ordered.
- The nasogastric tube was clamped for a few hours with minimal residual, and total parenteral nutrition (TFs) were restarted at midnight, advanced slowly at 10/hr without advancing.
- The patient has allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia.
- The last doses of antibiotics administered were fluconazole at 12:00 PM, daptom"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and is now presenting with ileus. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, fever, worsening bilateral pleural effusions, significant abdominal distention, bronchospasm consistent with CHF/pulmonary edema, and low urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. UGI bleed: The presence of coffee grounds in the nasogastric tube suggests possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hematocrit levels are stable, and he is receiving intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy to minimize further bleeding risk.

2. Sepsis: The patient's increasing temperature, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels indicate a possible septic shock. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient's blood cultures are pending.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species. He also has worsening bilateral pleural effusions that have reaccumulated after thoracentesis. This may indicate respiratory failure, and the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

4. Abdominal distention: The patient has significant abdominal distention, which could be due to ileus or small bowel obstruction. He is NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving nasogastr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a prolonged hospital stay due to a wound infection. He was admitted for respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and is now experiencing klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine. He also has multiple areas of skin breakdown. 

The patient developed fever and hypotension, indicating a possible sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or anaphylactoid reaction. He defervesced and came off pressors without any new antibiotics and with discontinuation of fluconazole. A rash also improved off a suspected drug reaction. No other source of infection was found, and his BAL continued to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone was started due to refractory hypotension.

The patient's ileus and partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) have not improved, with ongoing difficulty tolerating tube feeds. His lactate levels are rising, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's ability to tolerate tube feeds is still being monitored.

The patient has signs of an upper gastrointestinal bleed, as evidenced by coffee grounds in the nasogastric (NG) tube. He is being transfused supportively, given his high-dose steroids and continued IV proton"

   -Hold TF and opiates for now
   -Monitor exam closely, follow lactate
   -NGT to intermittent suction.
   - If he conts to be unable to tolerate tube feeds we may need to

   continue IV PPI.
   - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: this is an effect of  the large amount
   of free water he is getting from Bactrim, for now we will need to cont

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection of the foot and has had a prolonged hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy. The patient has klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine, as well as multiple areas of skin breakdown. He also has an ileus and non-functioning G-tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum, and klebsiella in his urine. This can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid reaction/drug fever: The patient was started on hydrocortisone due to refractory hypotension and weaning off pressors. This indicates a possible adrenal insufficiency or drug-related reaction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require full ventilatory support due to respiratory failure, which is complicated by profound deconditioning.
4. Renal failure/hyponatremia: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and he has hyponatremia, which may be due to the large amount of free water he is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and a recent history of wound infection leading to respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and a tracheostomy. The patient's current condition includes worsening abdominal distension, fever, hypotension, non-functioning G-tube, intermittent small bowel obstruction (SBO)/ileus, pleural effusions, and skin breakdown.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a known history of recurrent sepsis, and his current symptoms of fever and hypotension may indicate a possible septic episode. Close monitoring and prompt management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid reaction: The patient was started on hydrocortisone due to refractory hypotension, which suggests a possibility of adrenal insufficiency or an anaphylactoid reaction. Further evaluation and management are required to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

3. Drug fever: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, and the defervescence of fever after stopping fluconazole suggests a drug-related fever. Monitoring for any signs of allergic reactions or adverse drug events is crucial.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require full ventilatory support, indicating ongoing respiratory failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted for a wound infection of the foot and developed respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and had a tracheostomy placed. He now presents with Klebsiella and Acinetobacter in his sputum, as well as Klebsiella in his urine. He also has multiple areas of skin breakdown, explaining recent fevers and hypotension. The patient aspirated and has a non-functioning G-tube with concern for partial small bowel obstruction (SBO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple infections, including Klebsiella and Acinetobacter in the sputum and urine, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient may have adrenal insufficiency due to his history of alcohol abuse, which can be exacerbated by stress or infection.
3. Anaphylactoid reaction/drug fever: The patient had a rash that improved after stopping fluconazole, suggesting a drug reaction.
4. Ileus: The patient has evidence of ileus, as indicated by bowel distention and dilated bowel loops on the abdominal X-ray. This may be due to the recent surgery or the use of opiates for pain.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support and"

   initiated [**11-4**], then dc
ed for abd distention.  Ileus +/o sbo, making
   stool.
   - NPO, hold TFs
   - bowel regimen
   - no opioids, DC nalaone
   2.  UGIB/coffee grounds
 noted on [**11-3**], now resolved, with downward
   trend in hct.
   - iv ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - t/c 2 units
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23
   - hold aspirin, plavix
   3.  Hypotension
 intermittent pressors [**Date range (1) 6498**], concern for septic
   shock vs adrenal insufficiency, ECHO [**11-2**] showed no RWMA, nl EF.
   Remains on broad spectrum abx and stress dose steroids (started [**11-2**]),
   now off pressors.
   - [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
 to complete 14d course (started [**10-25**], to end
   [**11-7**])
   - MAPs>60, trend lactate, levophed as needed
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - minimize IVF boluses for hypotension
   - hold lasix for now, but consider lasix drip if hemodynamics improve
   - decrease steroids to 25 q6, then taper over 3 days
   4.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.
   -  [**Last Name (un) 430**], dapto, bactrim, for pna
   -  A/C, PS trial
   -  f/u bronch results
   5.  Hyponatremia - likely SIADH given low sodium.  Difficult to control
   free water given NPO and no TFs.
   - serial lytes
   - when able to feed him, will stop IVF and free water restrict
   6.  Nutrition - failed S&S, PEG placement by IR, now on hold from NPO.
   Given concern for obstruction, will remain NPO.
   - hold TFs due to ileus
   - will discuss TPN, as needs nutrition long term
   7.  PD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above
   - hold opioids due to ileus vs sbo and hypotension
   8.  UTI.  UTI ESBL Klebsiella species, S to meropenem (last Klebs MIC
   panel pending).  Foley changed [**10-27**].  Also, yeast in urine.  Completed
   2 days of fluconazole, which was stopped given concern for drug rash.
   9.  Rash.  Concern for drug rash. Will stop fluconazole as this was
   recently started and may be the offending [**Doctor Last Name **].  Now significantly
   improved.
   10. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.
   Found to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. He was admitted with multifocal pneumonia, hypotension, and small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient's condition has been complex and dynamic, with multiple medical complications.

Medical Complications:

1. Ileus: The patient has had abdominal distention and a tympanitic abdomen, indicating ileus. Initially, he was given total parenteral nutrition (TF) but was later made NPO due to abdominal distention. A bowel regimen was initiated, and narcotics were discontinued.

2. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient had coffee grounds in his stomach on 11/3, which has since resolved. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has improved, and he is no longer transfused. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were administered.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced intermittent hypotension, requiring pressors. There is concern for septic shock versus adrenal insufficiency. An echocardiogram (echo) showed no regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) and normal ejection fraction (EF). The patient remains on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has pneumonia caused by"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary of Information:
- The patient presented with worsening abdominal distention, which was initially diagnosed as ileus but later identified as small bowel obstruction (SBO).
- The patient was made NPO (nothing by mouth), given PO naloxone, and opioids were discontinued. This led to an improvement in abdominal examination.
- The patient's thyroid medication, Synthroid, was switched to IV due to the patient being NPO.
- A BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) culture showed growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and Gram-positive diplococci.
- The patient's wife expressed her wishes not to be contacted regarding worsening in the patient's status, only to be notified if the patient has passed away.
- The patient was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s, but responded to a fluid bolus and blood transfusion, resulting in improved blood pressure.
- The patient has a history of allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient received various antibiotics, including daptomycin, meropenem, and Bactrim.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications in the ICU, including midazolam, pantoprazole"

   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna now with ileus.
   1.  Ileus- dist, tympanitic abd since [**10-30**], mild improvement.  TFs
   initiated [**11-4**], then dc
ed for abd distention.  Ileus +/o sbo, making
   stool.
   - NPO, hold TFs
   - bowel regimen
   - no opioids, DC nalaone
   2.  UGIB/coffee grounds
 noted on [**11-3**], now resolved, with downward
   trend in hct.
   - iv ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - t/c 2 units
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23
   - hold aspirin, plavix
   3.  Hypotension
 intermittent pressors [**Date range (1) 6498**], concern for septic
   shock vs adrenal insufficiency, ECHO [**11-2**] showed no RWMA, nl EF.
   Remains on broad spectrum abx and stress dose steroids (started [**11-2**]),
   now off pressors.
   - [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
 to complete 14d course (started [**10-25**], to end
   [**11-7**])
   - MAPs>60, trend lactate, levophed as needed
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - minimize IVF boluses for hypotension
   - hold lasix for now, but consider lasix drip if hemodynamics improve
   - decrease steroids to 25 q6, then taper over 3 days
   4.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.
   -  [**Last Name (un) 430**], dapto, bactrim, for pna
   -  A/C, PS trial
   -  f/u bronch results
   5.  Hyponatremia - likely SIADH given low sodium.  Difficult to control
   free water given NPO and no TFs.
   - serial lytes
   - when able to feed him, will stop IVF and free water restrict
   6.  Nutrition - failed S&S, PEG placement by IR, now on hold from NPO.
   Given concern for obstruction, will remain NPO.
   - hold TFs due to ileus
   - will discuss TPN, as needs nutrition long term
   7.  PD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above
   - hold opioids due to ileus vs sbo and hypotension
   8.  UTI.  UTI ESBL Klebsiella species, S to meropenem (last Klebs MIC
   panel pending).  Foley changed [**10-27**].  Also, yeast in urine.  Completed
   2 days of fluconazole, which was stopped given concern for drug rash.
   9.  Rash.  Concern for drug rash. Will stop fluconazole as this was
   recently started and may be the offending [**Doctor Last Name **].  Now significantly
   improved.
   10. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.
   Found to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.
   - hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix drip in PM pending echo
   results

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Ileus: The patient has been diagnosed with ileus, which is characterized by distension and tympanitic abdomen. This has resulted in the discontinuation of tube feedings (TFs) and a bowel regimen has been initiated.

2. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient previously experienced UGIB, evident by coffee grounds in the stomach, but it has since resolved. The patient is on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Aspirin and Plavix have been held.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive and required pressors. There is concern for septic shock versus adrenal insufficiency. An echocardiogram showed no regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) and normal ejection fraction (EF). The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species. He also has worsening bilateral"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve
   >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.
   -Continue [**Last Name (un) **]/Bactrim Day 1 = [**10-25**] (start renal dosing) planned for 14
   day course.
   -Continue Dapto, but may be able to stop if Cx are negative (Day 1 =
   [**10-27**])
   -Continue hydrocort but will decrease dose (out of concern for bowel
   pathology)
    >Ileus vs partial SBO: he has not been able to tolerate tube feeds on
   [**11-4**], the concerning finding is the rising lactate which we will cont
   to follow. At present his stool out put has again increased but we will
   need to hold tube feeds for the day and attempt to restart  (possibly
   with reglan). Will hold opiates.
   -Hold TF and opiates for now
   -Monitor exam closely, follow lactate
   -NGT to intermittent suction.
   - If he conts to be unable to tolerate tube feeds we may need to
   consider TPN
   > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids and
   continue IV PPI.
   - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: this is an effect of  the large amount
   of free water he is getting from Bactrim, for now we will need to cont
   to free water restrict. Hopefully, we will be able to restart PO
   bactrim if we can improve the illeus  He also is slowly increasing his
   Cr (up from 0.5 on [**10-31**]).
   >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  For now he
   conts to require full ventilatory support.  His resp failure is
   complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will be
   difficult to improve.
   -Continue ventilatory support

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:
   holding plavix pending resolution of possible SBO
   >PAIN:
   -Start Tylenol around the clock
   -Try to avoid opiates

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He has been admitted for a wound infection of the foot and has developed respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy in place. The patient also has klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum, klebsiella in his urine, and multiple areas of skin breakdown. 

The patient's recent events include aspiration, non-functioning G-tube, intermittent small bowel obstruction/ileus, fever/hypotension, and refractory hypotension requiring hydrocortisone. 

The plan includes continuing bactrim, dapto, and hydrocortisone. The patient's lactate levels are being monitored due to concerns about his ability to tolerate tube feeds. If he continues to have difficulty, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be considered. 

The patient has a high risk for an upper gastrointestinal bleed given his high-dose steroids, so supportive transfusion is planned. 

Hypothyroidism is suspected due to recurrent illeus and the patient has been switched to IV synthroid. 

Renal failure/hyponatremia is also noted, likely due to the large amount of free water from bactrim. Free water restriction is being implemented. 

The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve and we are trying on [**11-6**] to restart the tube feeds.
    >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  Our course is now complicated as the
   acinetobacter, at this point it seems appropriate to consult ID to help
   with management given the progression of resistant pathogens
   -Will get ID input as this is a difficult question to address, should
   we change to Cefepime and meropenem
   -We will stop the daptomycin today.
   -Continue hydrocort but will decrease dose (out of concern for bowel
   pathology)
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: he has not been able to tolerate tube feeds on
   [**11-4**], the concerning finding is the rising lactate which we will cont
   to follow. At present his stool out put has again increased but we will
   need to hold tube feeds for the day and restarted reglan and will try
   to re-initiate tube feeds.
   -Re-start TF with reglan starting at 10 cc/hr
   -NGT keep in place
   - If he conts to be unable to tolerate tube feeds we may need to
   consider TPN
    > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids and
   continue IV PPI.
   - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: this is an effect of  the large amount
   of free water he is getting from Bactrim, for now we will need to cont
   to free water restrict. Hopefully, we will be able to restart PO
   bactrim if we can improve the illeus  He also is slowly increasing his
   Cr (up from 0.5 on [**10-31**]) and we will cont to follow this closely. The
   Na has improved in the setting of decreasing the Bactrim to [**Hospital1 **] (based
   on renal clearance)
   >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  For now he
   conts to require full ventilatory support.  His resp failure is
   complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will be
   difficult to improve.  We have made some improvements over the last 24
   hrs (in terms of SBO) and has tolerated PS trial ([**9-28**]) we will
   attempt to decrease the PS component today
   -Continue ventilatory support

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and recent hospitalization for a wound infection. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and multiple areas of skin breakdown. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Fever/Hypotension: The patient had fevers and hypotension, which may indicate sepsis. This could be due to an anaphylactoid reaction, drug fever, or adrenal insufficiency.

2. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has intermittent small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is unable to tolerate tube feeds. The rise in lactate suggests compromised tissue perfusion, indicating the need for close monitoring.

3. Renal failure/Hyponatremia: The patient has an increasing creatinine level and hyponatremia, likely caused by fluid overload and the use of Bactrim.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient requires full ventilatory support due to profound deconditioning and respiratory failure complicated by pneumonia and effusions.

5. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): The patient has PVD without critical limb ischemia, and Plavix is being held pending resolution of possible SBO.

6. Pain management: The patient should be started on Tylenol around the clock and avoid opiates. Wound care and follow-up with vascular surgery are also"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted for a wound infection in his foot and developed respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and eventually required a tracheostomy. Currently, he has klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine. He also has multiple areas of skin breakdown.

The patient's recent course has been complicated by fever, hypotension, and non-functioning G-tube with intermittent small bowel obstruction (SBO)/ileus. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics but still has persistent GNR bacteria in his sputum. He was started on hydrocortisone due to refractory hypotension and was able to wean off pressors. However, the patient now has rising lactate levels, indicating possible inadequate tissue perfusion or ongoing infection.

Other issues include hypothyroidism due to malabsorption, renal failure with hyponatremia likely secondary to free water administration from Bactrim, and respiratory failure requiring full ventilatory support. The patient also has peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia and pain management concerns.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has recurrent episodes of sepsis, and the current treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics has not completely resolved the infection. There is a concern for drug"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse,  CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve and we are trying on [**11-6**] to restart the tube feeds.
    >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  Our course is now complicated as the
   acinetobacter, at this point it seems appropriate to consult ID to help
   with management given the progression of resistant pathogens
   -Will get ID input as this is a difficult question to address, should
   we change to Cefepime and meropenem
   -We will stop the daptomycin today.
   -Continue hydrocort but will decrease dose (out of concern for bowel
   pathology)
    >Ileus vs partial SBO: he has not been able to tolerate tube feeds on
   [**11-4**], the concerning finding is the rising lactate which we will cont
   to follow. At present his stool out put has again increased but we will
   need to hold tube feeds for the day and restarted reglan and will try
   to re-initiate tube feeds.
   -Re-start TF with reglan.
   -NGT keep in place
   - If he conts to be unable to tolerate tube feeds we may need to
   consider TPN
   > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids and
   continue IV PPI.
   - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: this is an effect of  the large amount
   of free water he is getting from Bactrim, for now we will need to cont
   to free water restrict. Hopefully, we will be able to restart PO
   bactrim if we can improve the illeus  He also is slowly increasing his
   Cr (up from 0.5 on [**10-31**]).
   >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  For now he
   conts to require full ventilatory support.  His resp failure is
   complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will be
   difficult to improve.
   -Continue ventilatory support

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:
   holding plavix pending resolution of possible SBO
   >PAIN:
   -Start Tylenol around the clock
   -Try to avoid opiates
    - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt
   - Other issues per ICU resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and previous hospitalization for wound infection. He was admitted for respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient now presents with multiple complications including fever/hypotension, ileus vs partial small bowel obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleed, hypothyroidism, renal failure/hyponatremia, and respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing recurrent fevers and hypotension, indicating possible sepsis. Klebsiella and Acinetobacter have been identified in his sputum and urine, respectively.
2. Adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid reaction: The patient was started on hydrocortisone due to refractory hypotension.
3. Drug fever: The patient defervesced and came off pressors after discontinuing fluconazole.
4. Ileus vs partial small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has not tolerated tube feeds since 11/4, and there is a rising lactate level.
5. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: Coffee grounds were found in the NG tube, and the patient is at an increased risk for bleeding due to high-dose steroids.
6. Hypothyroidism: Low gut absorption may be causing the hypothyroidism, and the patient has been switched to IV synthroid.

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna now with ileus.
   1.  Ileus- dist, tympanitic abd since [**10-30**], mild improvement.  TFs
   initiated [**11-4**], then dc
ed for abd distention.  Ileus +/o sbo, making
   stool.
   - NPO, hold TFs
   - bowel regimen
   - no opioids, DC nalaone
   2.  UGIB/coffee grounds
 noted on [**11-3**], now resolved, with downward
   trend in hct.
   - iv ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - t/c 2 units
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23
   - hold aspirin, plavix
   3.  Hypotension
 intermittent pressors [**Date range (1) 6498**], concern for septic
   shock vs adrenal insufficiency, ECHO [**11-2**] showed no RWMA, nl EF.
   Remains on broad spectrum abx and stress dose steroids (started [**11-2**]),
   now off pressors.
   - [**Last Name (un) 430**], bactrim, dapto
 to complete 14d course (started [**10-25**], to end
   [**11-7**])
   - MAPs>60, trend lactate, levophed as needed
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - minimize IVF boluses for hypotension
   - hold lasix for now, but consider lasix drip if hemodynamics improve
   - decrease steroids to 25 q6, then taper over 3 days
   4.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.
   -  [**Last Name (un) 430**], dapto, bactrim, for pna
   -  A/C, PS trial
   -  f/u bronch results
   5.  Hyponatremia - likely SIADH given low sodium.  Difficult to control
   free water given NPO and no TFs.
   - serial lytes
   - when able to feed him, will stop IVF and free water restrict
   6.  Nutrition - failed S&S, PEG placement by IR, now on hold from NPO.
   Given concern for obstruction, will remain NPO.
   - hold TFs due to ileus
   - will discuss TPN, as needs nutrition long term
   7.  PD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above
   - hold opioids due to ileus vs sbo and hypotension
   8.  UTI.  UTI ESBL Klebsiella species, S to meropenem (last Klebs MIC
   panel pending).  Foley changed [**10-27**].  Also, yeast in urine.  Completed
   2 days of fluconazole, which was stopped given concern for drug rash.
   9.  Rash.  Concern for drug rash. Will stop fluconazole as this was
   recently started and may be the offending [**Doctor Last Name **].  Now significantly
   improved.
   10. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.
   Found to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.
   - hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix drip in PM pending echo
   results
   11. EOSINOPHILIA
 s/p tx strongyloides with ivermectin, ?drug

   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - minimize IVF boluses for hypotension
   - hold lasix for now, but consider lasix drip if hemodynamics improve
   - decrease steroids to 25 q6, then taper over 3 days
   - d/c dapto as no gram positive infection was found
   - switch bactrim to cefepime due to acinetobacter sensitivietes
   4.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so will switch to cefepime.
   -  [**Last Name (un) 430**], dapto, bactrim, for pna
   -  A/C, PS trial
   -  f/u bronch results
   - ID consult for antibiotics
   - start cefepime for acinetobacter
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 430**] for ESBL klebsiella
   5.  Hyponatremia - likely SIADH given low sodium.  Difficult to control
   free water given NPO and no TFs.
   - serial lytes
   - when able to feed him, will stop IVF and free water restrict
   6.  Nutrition - failed S&S, PEG placement by IR, now on hold from NPO.
   Given concern for obstruction, will remain NPO.
   - hold TFs due to ileus
   - will discuss TPN, as needs nutrition long term
   7.  PD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above
   - hold opioids due to ileus vs sbo and hypotension
   8.  UTI.  UTI ESBL Klebsiella species, S to meropenem (last Klebs MIC
   panel pending).  Foley changed [**10-27**].  Also, yeast in urine.  Completed
   2 days of fluconazole, which was stopped given concern for drug rash.
   9.  Rash.  Concern for drug rash. Will stop fluconazole as this was
   recently started and may be the offending [**Doctor Last Name **].  Now significantly
   improved.
   10. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.
   Found to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He was admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypotension, respiratory failure due to pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, hyponatremia, malnutrition, peripheral vascular disease, urinary tract infection (UTI), drug rash, heart failure, and eosinophilia. The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, stress dose steroids, tube feeding, and diuretics. The patient's condition remains unstable, and several issues need to be addressed, such as antibiotic resistance, ongoing infections, ileus, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Antibiotic resistance: The patient is infected with ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, which are difficult to treat. There is a concern for further development of antibiotic resistance.
2. Ongoing infections: The patient has pneumonia, UTI, and potential abdominal infection due to ileus. These infections need to be managed appropriately.
3. Ileus: The patient has not been able to tolerate oral intake and is at risk for further complications related to bowel obstruction.
4. Malnutrition: The patient has failed enteral nutrition and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

24-hour events include keeping the patient NPO (nothing by mouth) throughout the day, attempting to initiate tube feeds (TFs) that were later discontinued due to abdominal distention, performing a peritoneal lavage (PL), and conducting various lab tests.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55 to 113/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's general appearance is described as not well nourished and thin. Physical examination findings include crackles in the lung fields, soft distended abdomen with bowel sounds, and absent peripheral pulses.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.8 thousand/mm³, slightly low hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, normal platelet count of 182 thousand/mm³, elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and low glucose level of 64 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve and we are trying on [**11-6**] to restart the tube feeds.
   >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  He has an emerging pattern of
   increasingly resistant pathogens. We have changed coverage as below.
   - Change to Cefepime and  continued meropenem
   -Daptomycin stopped 11/ 18
   -Cont to decrease hydrocortisone
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: We are again trying tube feed regimen, he
   tolerated 10 cc yesterday with [**Last Name (LF) 6541**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to uptitrate 10 cc
   /shift
   -Cont reglan
   -NGT keep in place
   - If he conts to be unable to tolerate tube feeds we may need to
   consider TPN
   > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids and
   continue IV PPI. Hct has remained stable
    - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4 later in week.
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: both issues cont to slowly improve.
   Stopping the bactrim IV helped to decrease the free water load, in the
   next day or two we will need to add back free water. His renal function
   is also trending towards improvemen.
   >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  His resp
   failure is complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will
   be difficult to improve.  We have made some improvements over the last
   24 hrs (in terms of SBO) and has tolerated PS trial ([**9-28**]) and we have
   been able to make slow efforts to decrease his PS requirement
   -Continue ventilatory support
   - Pulm toilet

 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:
   holding plavix pending resolution of possible SBO
   >PAIN:
   -Start Tylenol around the clock
   -avoid opiates
   - continue wound care, f/u vascular surgery as outpt
   Other issues per ICU resident note.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and previous hospitalization for a wound infection.
- He was admitted for respiratory failure and is currently on ventilatory support through a tracheostomy tube.
- The patient has developed klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum, klebsiella in his urine, and multiple areas of skin breakdown.
- He has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, and intermittent small bowel obstruction/ileus.
- The patient's renal function and hyponatremia are slowly improving.
- He has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hypothyroidism, and pain related to his PVD.
- The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by profound deconditioning, and his peripheral vascular disease is being managed pending resolution of possible small bowel obstruction.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple known pathogens in his sputum and urine, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid reaction/drug fever: The patient has been treated with hydrocortisone and antibiotics, which may cause these complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is currently trending towards improvement, but there is a risk of renal failure due to his underlying conditions and medications.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, and careful management is needed to prevent or treat hyponatremia.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by his overall profound deconditioning, making it difficult to improve.
6. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has intermittent SBO/illeus, and if not managed properly, it can lead to further complications.
7. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could recur, especially with high-dose steroids.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient likely has low gut absorption due to recurrent illeus, and his thyroid function needs to be closely monitored.
9. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): The patient has PVD without critical limb ischemia, and there is a risk of worsening or complications related to this condition.
10. Pain management: The patient is experiencing pain, and proper pain management is essential to prevent further complications.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note, and there may be other risks and considerations for this patient."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve and we are trying on [**11-6**] to restart the tube feeds.
    >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  Our course is now complicated as the
   acinetobacter, at this point it seems appropriate to consult ID to help
   with management given the progression of resistant pathogens
   -Will get ID input as this is a difficult question to address, should
   we change to Cefepime and meropenem
   -We will stop the daptomycin today.
   -Continue hydrocort but will decrease dose (out of concern for bowel
   pathology)
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: he has not been able to tolerate tube feeds on
   [**11-4**], the concerning finding is the rising lactate which we will cont
   to follow. At present his stool out put has again increased but we will
   need to hold tube feeds for the day and restarted reglan and will try
   to re-initiate tube feeds.
   -Re-start TF with reglan starting at 10 cc/hr
   -NGT keep in place
   - If he conts to be unable to tolerate tube feeds we may need to
   consider TPN
    > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids and
   continue IV PPI.
   - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: this is an effect of  the large amount
   of free water he is getting from Bactrim, for now we will need to cont
   to free water restrict. Hopefully, we will be able to restart PO
   bactrim if we can improve the illeus  He also is slowly increasing his
   Cr (up from 0.5 on [**10-31**]) and we will cont to follow this closely. The

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection of the foot and developed respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy.
- The patient has klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine, along with multiple areas of skin breakdown.
- He has been aspirated and has a non-functioning G-tube with intermittent small bowel obstruction (SBO) and ileus.
- The patient's fever defervesced and he was taken off pressors without any new antibiotics and with discontinuation of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection was found.
- BAL continues to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone was started on [**11-2**] due to refractory hypotension.
- The patient's course is complicated by acinetobacter infection, which is resistant to antibiotics.
- Consult ID is requested for management.
- Daptomycin is being stopped, and cefepime and meropenem may be considered.
- Hydrocortisone dosage will be decreased.
- The patient has rising lactate levels and has not tolerated tube feeds since [**11-4**].
- NGT will be kept in place, and reglan will be restarted at 10 cc"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve and we are trying on [**11-6**] to restart the tube feeds.
   >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  He has an emerging pattern of
   increasingly resistant pathogens. We have changed coverage as below.
   - Change to Cefepime and  continued meropenem
   -Daptomycin stopped 11/ 18
   -Cont to decrease hydrocortisone, would change to prednisone tomorrow
   if tolerating PO well.
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: We are again trying tube feed regimen, he
   tolerated 10 cc yesterday with [**Last Name (LF) 6541**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to uptitrate 10 cc
   /shift
   -Cont reglan
   -NGT keep in place
   - If he conts to be unable to tolerate tube feeds we may need to
   consider TPN
   > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids and
   continue IV PPI. Hct has remained stable
    - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4 later in week.
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: both issues cont to slowly improve.
   Stopping the bactrim IV helped to decrease the free water load, in the
   next day or two we will need to add back free water. His renal function
   is also trending towards improvemen.
   >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  His resp
   failure is complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will
   be difficult to improve.  We have made some improvements over the last
   24 hrs (in terms of SBO) and has tolerated PS trial ([**9-28**]) and we have
   been able to make slow efforts to decrease his PS requirement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was initially admitted for a wound infection of the foot, which led to respiratory failure and recurrent sepsis. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has klebsiella and acinetobacter in his sputum and klebsiella in his urine. The patient also has multiple areas of skin breakdown, leading to recent fevers and hypotension. He has aspirated and has a non-functioning G-tube with intermittent small bowel obstruction (SBO)/ileus. The patient's condition is complicated by fever/hot nodules, sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency, anaphylactoid reaction/drug fever, ileus vs partial SBO, upper GI bleed, hypothyroidism, renal failure/hyponatremia, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has recurrent infections, including klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum, klebsiella in the urine, and skin breakdown. This increases the risk of developing sepsis.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's fever/hot nodules, hypotension, and response to hydrocortisone suggest the possibility of adrenal insufficiency.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve and we are trying on [**11-6**] to restart the tube feeds.
   >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  He has an emerging pattern of
   increasingly resistant pathogens. We have changed coverage as below.
   - Change to Cefepime and  continued meropenem
   -Daptomycin stopped 11/ 18
   -Cont to decrease hydrocortisone, would change to prednisone tomorrow
   if tolerating PO well.
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: We are again trying tube feed regimen, he
   tolerated 10 cc yesterday with [**Last Name (LF) 6541**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to uptitrate 10 cc
   /shift
   -Cont reglan
   -NGT keep in place
   - If he conts to be unable to tolerate tube feeds we may need to
   consider TPN
   > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids and
   continue IV PPI. Hct has remained stable
    - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4 later in week.
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: both issues cont to slowly improve.
   Stopping the bactrim IV helped to decrease the free water load, in the
   next day or two we will need to add back free water. His renal function
   is also trending towards improvemen.
   >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  His resp
   failure is complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will
   be difficult to improve.  We have made some improvements over the last
   24 hrs (in terms of SBO) and has tolerated PS trial ([**9-28**]) and we have
   been able to make slow efforts to decrease his PS requirement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted initially for a wound infection in his foot and subsequently developed respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now has a tracheostomy. He is currently experiencing klebsiella and acinetobacter infections in his sputum and urine, as well as multiple areas of skin breakdown. The patient has also aspirated, has a non-functioning G-tube, and intermittent small bowel obstruction/ileus. He has been febrile with hypotension, and his fever has defervesced after stopping fluconazole. His condition is complicated by sepsis, possible adrenal insufficiency, anaphylactoid reaction, or drug fever. He has been on hydrocortisone since November 2nd and is slowly weaning off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The use of hydrocortisone indicates a concern for adrenal insufficiency, which can be life-threatening if not treated appropriately.
3. Anaphylactoid reaction: The presence of allergies to certain antibiotics raises the possibility of an anaphylactoid reaction to medication.
4. Drug fever: The patient's fever may be"

   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna now with ileus.
   1.  Ileus- dist, tympanitic abd since [**10-30**], mild improvement.  TFs
   initiated [**11-4**], then dc
ed for abd distention.  Ileus +/o sbo, making
   stool.  Toerated tube feeds at 10 cc/hour yesterday.   Will try to
   advance diet today to 20 cc/ hour today and increase by 10 q shift
   until he reaches goal.
   - tube feeds at 20 cc/hour and increase by 10 q shift until goal
   - bowel regimen
   - no opioids
   -continue reglan
   - serial abdominal exams
   - pull NGT in am if he tolerates feeding
   2.  UGIB/coffee grounds
 noted on [**11-3**], now resolved, hct stable.
   - iv ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - t/c 2 units
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23
   - hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if hct/
   bleed remains stable
   3.  Hypotension
 intermittent pressors [**Date range (1) 6498**], concern for septic
   shock vs adrenal insufficiency, ECHO [**11-2**] showed no RWMA, nl EF.
   Remains on broad spectrum abx and stress dose steroids (started [**11-2**]),
   now off pressors for several days.
   - [**Last Name (un) 430**]
 to complete 14d course (started [**10-25**], to end [**11-7**])
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - minimize IVF boluses for hypotension
   - hold lasix for now, but consider lasix drip if hemodynamics improve
   - decrease steroids to 25 q12
   - cefepime for acinetobacter
   4.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime.
   - wean peep, continue PS
   -  f/u bronch results
   - f/u ID recs
   - start cefepime for acinetobacter
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 430**] for ESBL klebsiella
   5.  Hyponatremia - likely SIADH given low sodium.  Difficult to control
   free water given NPO and no TFs.
   - serial lytes
   - minimize free water flushes for now, but monitor sodium
   6.  Nutrition - failed S&S, PEG placement by IR, now on hold from NPO.
   Given concern for obstruction, has been NPO for several days, but diet
   advanced yesterday.
   - advance tube feeds to 20 cc/hour and increase by 10 cc/hour q shift
   - will discuss TPN, as needs nutrition long term
   7.  PD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when NGT is
   removed and hct stable
   - hold opioids due to ileus
   8.  UTI.  UTI ESBL Klebsiella species, S to meropenem (last Klebs MIC
   panel pending).  Foley changed [**10-27**].  Also, yeast in urine.  Completed
   2 days of fluconazole, which was stopped given concern for drug rash.
   Again with yeast in urine.
   9.  Rash.  Concern for drug rash. Will stop fluconazole as this was
   recently started and may be the offending [**Doctor Last Name **].  Now resolved.
   10. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.
   Found to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.
   - hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix drip in future

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on tube feeds. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypotension, respiratory failure due to pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, hyponatremia, poor nutritional status, peripheral artery disease (PAD) with dry gangrene in the left toes, urinary tract infection (UTI), rash, and diastolic heart failure. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/57 to 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a mildly improved creatinine level and fluid balance within normal limits.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for the pneumonia, stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and elevated D-dimer"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. He was admitted with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been diagnosed with multi-drug resistant Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to multi-drug resistant GNRs.
- Ileus, possibly secondary to abdominal distention.
- Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with coffee grounds in the stomach, which has now resolved.
- Hypotension requiring intermittent pressors, concern for septic shock versus adrenal insufficiency.
- Bilateral pleural effusions that have reaccumulated following thoracentesis.
- Respiratory failure due to PNA (ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter).
- Hyponatremia likely secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).
- Failed enteral feeding with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.
- Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with dry gangrene in lower extremities (LLE).
- Urinary tract infection (UTI) with ESBL Klebsiella species.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on tube feeds at 10/h, thus far tolerating well.
   - ID reconsulted to multidrug resistent GNRs; recommended continuing
   cefepime (started yesterday) and meropenem (doses increased due to
   mildly improved creatinine); adding on a number of drug sensis in the

 to complete 14d course (started [**10-25**], to end [**11-7**])
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - minimize IVF boluses for hypotension
   - hold lasix for now, but consider lasix drip if hemodynamics improve
   - decrease steroids to 25 q6, then taper over 3 days
   - d/c dapto as no gram positive infection was found
   - switch bactrim to cefepime due to acinetobacter sensitivietes
   4.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so will switch to cefepime.
   -  [**Last Name (un) 430**], dapto, bactrim, for pna
   -  A/C, PS trial
   -  f/u bronch results
   - ID consult for antibiotics
   - start cefepime for acinetobacter
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 430**] for ESBL klebsiella
   5.  Hyponatremia - likely SIADH given low sodium.  Difficult to control
   free water given NPO and no TFs.
   - serial lytes
   - when able to feed him, will stop IVF and free water restrict
   6.  Nutrition - failed S&S, PEG placement by IR, now on hold from NPO.
   Given concern for obstruction, will remain NPO.
   - hold TFs due to ileus
   - will discuss TPN, as needs nutrition long term
   7.  PD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above
   - hold opioids due to ileus vs sbo and hypotension
   8.  UTI.  UTI ESBL Klebsiella species, S to meropenem (last Klebs MIC
   panel pending).  Foley changed [**10-27**].  Also, yeast in urine.  Completed
   2 days of fluconazole, which was stopped given concern for drug rash.
   9.  Rash.  Concern for drug rash. Will stop fluconazole as this was
   recently started and may be the offending [**Doctor Last Name **].  Now significantly
   improved.
   10. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.
   Found to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.
   - hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix drip in PM pending echo
   results

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has been started on tube feeds, which they are tolerating well. The ID consultant has recommended continuing cefepime and increasing the doses of meropenem due to mildly improved creatinine. Additional drugs sensitive to the identified multidrug-resistant GNRs will be added based on lab results.

The patient has allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The last doses of antibiotics administered were daptomycin at 10:10 PM, Bactrim (SMX/TMP) at 06:37 PM, meropenem at 04:00 AM, and cefepime at 04:22 AM.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:00 PM, heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at 12:00 AM, and other medications as per the doctor's order.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 93 bpm (with a range of 78-97 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 110/57 mmHg to 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (with a range of 5"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve although he is now tolerating a slow advance in his tube
   feeds.
   >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  He has an emerging pattern of
   increasingly resistant pathogens. We have changed coverage as below and
   awating BAL sensitivity data.  He also has a pseudomonas pathogen
   (<4000 colonies in BAL). We will need to figure out exactly how long to
   treat as he has been on meropenem since [**10-25**] and Cefepime [**11-6**]. We
   will discuss with ID a course duration.
   - Change to Cefepime and  continued meropenem.
   -Change to prednisone with a taper  to begin11/20, 10 mg starting today
   and then taper
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: We are again trying tube feed regimen, he
   tolerated 10 cc yesterday with [**Last Name (LF) 6541**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to uptitrate 10 cc
   /shift
   -Cont reglan and advancing tube feeds
   -remove NG tube today
    > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids . Hct
   has remained stable
    - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   - Change PPI to PO.
   > lower [**First Name3 (LF) **] edema: increasing in the right lower [**Last Name (LF) **] , [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] r/o DVT and
   consider diuresis challenge as he is likely volume up from the resus
   efforts and the steroids.
   - LENI
   - consider diuresis
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4 later in week.
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: both issues cont to slowly improve.
   Stopping the bactrim IV helped to decrease the free water load, in the
   next day or two we will need to add back free water. His renal function
   is also trending towards improvemen.
   >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  His resp
   failure is complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will
   be difficult to improve.  We have made some improvements over the last
   24 hrs (in terms of SBO) and has tolerated PS trial ([**9-28**]) and we have
   been able to make slow efforts to decrease his PS requirement

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve although he is now tolerating a slow advance in his tube
   feeds.
   >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  He has an emerging pattern of
   increasingly resistant pathogens. We have changed coverage as below and
   awating BAL sensitivity data.  He also has a pseudomonas pathogen
   (<4000 colonies in BAL). We will need to figure out exactly how long to
   treat as he has been on meropenem since [**10-25**] and Cefepime [**11-6**]. We
   will discuss with ID a course duration.
   - Change to Cefepime and  continued meropenem.
   -Change to prednisone with a taper  to begin11/20, 10 mg starting today
   and then taper
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: We are again trying tube feed regimen, he
   tolerated 10 cc yesterday with [**Last Name (LF) 6541**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to uptitrate 10 cc
   /shift
   -Cont reglan and advancing tube feeds
   -remove NG tube today
    > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids . Hct
   has remained stable
    - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding.
   - Change PPI to PO.
   > lower ext edema: increasing in the right lower ext , - LENI (+) for
   DVT start IV heparin PTT 50
   - consider diuresis
   > Hypothyroidism: likely low gut absorption given recurrent illeus we
   have changed to IV synthroid.  We will recheck free T4 later in week.
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: both issues cont to slowly improve.
   Stopping the bactrim IV helped to decrease the free water load, in the
   next day or two we will need to add back free water. His renal function
   is also trending towards improvemen.
   >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  His resp
   failure is complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will
   be difficult to improve.  We have made some improvements over the last
   24 hrs (in terms of SBO) and has tolerated PS trial ([**9-28**]) and we have
   been able to make slow efforts to decrease his PS requirement
   -Continue ventilatory support
   - Pulm toilet

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has recurrent infections, including wound infection, respiratory infection, and urinary tract infection. This increases the risk of developing sepsis.

2. Organ failure: The patient has already experienced renal failure, respiratory failure, and possible adrenal insufficiency. These organ failures can further complicate the patient's condition.

3. Pneumonia: The presence of klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum suggests ongoing pneumonia, which may require adjustment in antibiotic therapy.

4. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has intermittent small bowel obstruction (SBO) and ileus. This can lead to malnutrition and dehydration if not properly managed.

5. Lower extremity edema: The increasing edema in the right lower extremity raises concerns for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Appropriate anticoagulation should be initiated.

6. Hypothyroidism: The patient likely has hypothyroidism due to low gut absorption. IV synthroid has been started, but free T4 levels should be monitored.

7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is slowly improving after stopping bactrim IV. Free water supplementation may be required soon.

8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by profound deconditioning"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD, and recent hospitalization for a wound infection of the foot. The patient was initially admitted for respiratory failure and has since developed recurrent sepsis, now status post tracheostomy with klebsiella and acinetobacter in sputum and klebsiella in urine. The patient also has multiple areas of skin breakdown, resulting in recent fevers and hypotension. The patient has been aspirated, with a non-functioning G tube and intermittent small bowel obstruction (SBO)/illeus. The patient's condition is complicated by fever/hypotension due to sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid reaction, as well as drug fever. The patient's renal function and hyponatremia are slowly improving. The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by profound deconditioning. The patient has peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia and pain management is needed. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient has recurrent sepsis due to klebsiella and acinetobacter infections in the sputum and klebsiella in the urine. This increases the risk of sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of 24-hour events. The patient has a history of allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The patient received multiple antibiotics including cefepime, tigecycline, tetracycline, colistin, and meropenem. Steroids were tapered to 25 q 12, and tube feeds were advanced to 20 cc/hour.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/58 to 134/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,532 mL with a total output of 910 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 622 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 403 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 158, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not performed, skin assessment not performed, neurologic assessment not performed, and labs/radiology pending.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 5.2 to 8.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 24.5 to 31.0 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 51 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose ranging from 85 to 115 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's ICU care includes nutrition with Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 30 mL/hour and glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has a PICC line in place for medication administration. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is provided. The patient's head of bed (HOB) is elevated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention, and mouth care is also performed. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status."

He is currently in the ICU due to an infection with ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. He has been experiencing ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), right lower extremity (RLE) edema, hypotension, respiratory failure, hyponatremia, malnutrition, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus - The patient has been experiencing distension and tympanitic abdomen since [date], but improvement is noted. It is important to continue bowel regimen, increase tube feeds to 40cc/hr, and monitor for any signs of worsening.
2. UGIB - The patient had coffee grounds in the stomach on [date], which has now resolved. It is important to continue with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, transfusion if hemoglobin (Hct) is below 23, and consider resuming aspirin in the future if Hct/bleeding remains stable.
3. RLE Edema - This appears to be a new finding and should be ruled out for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) through lower"

   -continue reglan
   - serial abdominal exams
   - pull NGT in am if he tolerates feeding
   2.  UGIB/coffee grounds
 noted on [**11-3**], now resolved, hct stable.
   - iv ppi [**Hospital1 **]
   - t/c 2 units
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23
   - hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if hct/
   bleed remains stable
   3.  Hypotension
 intermittent pressors [**Date range (1) 6498**], concern for septic
   shock vs adrenal insufficiency, ECHO [**11-2**] showed no RWMA, nl EF.
   Remains on broad spectrum abx and stress dose steroids (started [**11-2**]),
   now off pressors for several days.
   - [**Last Name (un) 430**]
 to complete 14d course (started [**10-25**], to end [**11-7**])
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - minimize IVF boluses for hypotension
   - hold lasix for now, but consider lasix drip if hemodynamics improve
   - decrease steroids to 25 q12
   - cefepime for acinetobacter
   4.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime.
   - wean peep, continue PS
   -  f/u bronch results
   - f/u ID recs
   - start cefepime for acinetobacter
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 430**] for ESBL klebsiella
   5.  Hyponatremia - likely SIADH given low sodium.  Difficult to control
   free water given NPO and no TFs.
   - serial lytes
   - minimize free water flushes for now, but monitor sodium
   6.  Nutrition - failed S&S, PEG placement by IR, now on hold from NPO.
   Given concern for obstruction, has been NPO for several days, but diet
   advanced yesterday.
   - advance tube feeds to 20 cc/hour and increase by 10 cc/hour q shift
   - will discuss TPN, as needs nutrition long term
   7.  PD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when NGT is
   removed and hct stable
   - hold opioids due to ileus
   8.  UTI.  UTI ESBL Klebsiella species, S to meropenem (last Klebs MIC
   panel pending).  Foley changed [**10-27**].  Also, yeast in urine.  Completed
   2 days of fluconazole, which was stopped given concern for drug rash.
   Again with yeast in urine.
   9.  Rash.  Concern for drug rash. Will stop fluconazole as this was
   recently started and may be the offending [**Doctor Last Name **].  Now resolved.
   10. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.
   Found to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.
   - hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix drip in future

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement due to esophageal strictures and failure to swallow.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Ileus with abdominal distention: The patient has been experiencing distention and tympanic sounds in the abdomen since October 30th. Tube feeding initiation was started on November 4th, but discontinued due to abdominal distention. The plan is to advance tube feeds to 20 cc/hour and increase by 10 cc/hour every shift until reaching the goal.

2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient had coffee grounds emesis on November 3rd, which has now resolved. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable. The plan is to continue IV pantoprazole, transfuse if Hct falls below 23, hold aspirin and Plavix, and consider resuming aspirin in the future if Hct/bleeding remains stable.

3. Hypotension and concern for septic shock or adrenal insufficiency: The patient required intermittent pressors from October 25th to November 7th. An echocardiogram on November 2nd showed no regional wall"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve although he is now tolerating a slow advance in his tube
   feeds.
   >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  He has an emerging pattern of
   increasingly resistant pathogens. We have changed coverage as below and
   awating BAL sensitivity data.  He also has a pseudomonas pathogen
   (<4000 colonies in BAL). We will need to figure out exactly how long to
   treat as he has been on meropenem since [**10-25**] and Cefepime [**11-6**]. and
   will be continued until [**11-10**] (7 day course from last pos clx)
   - Change to Cefepime and  continued meropenem until [**11-10**]
   - Prednisone taper con, decrease to Prednisone 7.5 mg (from 10 mg)
   - Add back Beta blocker for rate control of A-fib, he has been
   tolerating well.
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: We have been able to slowly increase the tube
   feed regimen via the PEG/J to 50 cc/hr with reglan.
   -Cont reglan and advancing tube feeds
   > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids . Hct
   has remained stable, on PO PPI
    - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding..
   > lower ext edema: increasing in the right lower ext  with  LENI (+)
   for DVT start IV heparin PTT 50, will covert to enoxaparin today.
   - convert to coumadin
   > Hypothyroidism: change back to PO synthroid
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: both issues cont to slowly improve.
   Stopping the bactrim IV helped to decrease the free water load, in the
   next day or two we will need to add back free water. His renal function
   is also trending towards improvemen.
    >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  His resp
   failure is complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will
   be difficult to improve.  We have made some improvements over the last
   24 hrs (in terms of SBO) and has tolerated PS trial ([**9-28**]) and we have
   been able to make slow efforts to decrease his PS requirement. [**11-9**] we
   have changed back to TM and he is tolerating well.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection in the foot and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy. The patient has klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum, klebsiella in the urine, and multiple areas of skin breakdown. He also has an ileus and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has recurrent sepsis due to the presence of klebsiella and acinetobacter in the sputum and klebsiella in the urine. This increases the risk of systemic infection and septic shock.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has been treated with hydrocortisone for refractory hypotension, which may suggest adrenal insufficiency.
3. Anaphylactoid reaction: The patient has a known allergy to vancomycin and linezolid, which could potentially lead to an anaphylactoid reaction if exposed to these medications.
4. Drug fever: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, and there is a possibility of developing drug fever.
5. Increasingly resistant pathogens: The patient has an emerging pattern of increasingly resistant pathogens, which makes it challenging to treat the infections effectively.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 y/o M COPD on home O2, ETOH abuse, CAD, PVD s/p BPG originally
   admitted for wound infection of foot resulting in long hospital course
   with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, now status post
   tracheostomy on TM now with klebsiella/acinetobacter in sputum and
   klebsiella in the urine as well as multiple areas of skin break down to
   explain recent fevers and hypotension.. [**10-30**] aspirated now with non
   functioning G tube and intermittent SBO/illeus which has been difficult
   to resolve although he is now tolerating a slow advance in his tube
   feeds.
   >Fever/HOTN
 sepsis +/- adrenal insufficiency and/or anaphylactoid
   reaction / drug fever. Defervesced and off pressors without any new Abx
   and with d/c of fluconazole. No other apparent source of infection. BAL
   conts to show GNR consistent with prior known pathogens. Hydrocortisone
   was started on [**11-2**] in the setting of refractory hypotension and we
   were able to wean off pressors.  He has an emerging pattern of
   increasingly resistant pathogens. We have changed coverage as below and
   awating BAL sensitivity data.  He also has a pseudomonas pathogen
   (<4000 colonies in BAL). We will need to figure out exactly how long to
   treat as he has been on meropenem since [**10-25**] and Cefepime [**11-6**]. and
   will be continued until [**11-10**] (7 day course from last pos clx)
   - Change to Cefepime and  continued meropenem until [**11-10**]
   - Prednisone taper con, decrease to Prednisone 7.5 mg (from 10 mg)
   - Add back Beta blocker for rate control of A-fib, he has been
   tolerating well.
   >Ileus vs partial SBO: We have been able to slowly increase the tube
   feed regimen via the PEG/J to 50 cc/hr with reglan.
   -Cont reglan and advancing tube feeds
   > Upper GI bleed: coffee grounds in the NG tube. Will transfuse
   supportively he is at increase risk given his high dose steroids . Hct
   has remained stable, on PO PPI
    - Hct goal < 23 or active bleeding..
   > lower ext edema: increasing in the right lower ext  with  LENI (+)
   for DVT start IV heparin PTT 50, will covert to enoxaparin today.
   - convert to coumadin
   > Hypothyroidism: change back to PO synthroid
   >Renal failure /  Hyponatremia: both issues cont to slowly improve.
   Stopping the bactrim IV helped to decrease the free water load, in the
   next day or two we will need to add back free water. His renal function
   is also trending towards improvemen.
    >Resp failure
 PNA, ileus, effusions/volume overload.  His resp
   failure is complicated  by his overall profound deconditioning and will
   be difficult to improve.  We have made some improvements over the last
   24 hrs (in terms of SBO) and has tolerated PS trial ([**9-28**]) and we have
   been able to make slow efforts to decrease his PS requirement. [**11-9**] we
   have changed back to TM and he is tolerating well.
   -Continue ventilatory support, trach mask trials
   - Pulm toilet
 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITHOUT CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA:

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of COPD, ETOH abuse, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for a wound infection of the foot and has had a long hospital course with respiratory failure, recurrent sepsis, and now status post tracheostomy. The patient is currently experiencing fever, hypotension, skin breakdown, and intermittent small bowel obstruction/ileus. He is also dealing with hypothyroidism, renal failure, and hyponatremia. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics and pressors, and his condition remains complicated by profound deconditioning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing recurrent sepsis, and his recent fever and hypotension may indicate another episode of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has been treated with hydrocortisone for refractory hypotension, suggesting a possible diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation and management are needed to confirm this diagnosis.

3. Anaphylactoid reaction: The patient's hypotension and rash could be indicative of an anaphylactoid reaction. Close observation for any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction is essential.

4. Drug fever: The patient's fever and hypotension may be caused by a drug fever. Review of all"

   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - hold lasix for now, but consider lasix drip if hemodynamics improve
   - decrease steroids to prednisone 10mg, beginning taper [**11-8**]
   5.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime.
   - wean peep, continue PS
   -  f/u bronch results
   - f/u ID recs
   - cefepime for acinetobacter, [**Last Name (un) 430**] for ESBL klebsiella
   6.  Hyponatremia - likely SIADH given low sodium, now stable.
   Anticipate drop with TFs.
   - serial lytes
   - minimize free water flushes for now, but monitor sodium
   7.  Nutrition - failed S&S, PEG placement by IR, now on hold from NPO.
   Given concern for obstruction, has been NPO for several days, but diet
   advanced yesterday.
   - advance tube feeds to 40 cc/hour and increase by 10 cc/hour q shift
   - will discuss TPN, as needs nutrition long term
   8.  PD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when NGT is
   removed and hct stable
   - hold opioids due to ileus
   9.  UTI.  UTI ESBL Klebsiella species, S to meropenem (last Klebs MIC
   panel pending).  Foley changed [**10-27**].  Also, yeast in urine.  Completed
   2 days of fluconazole, which was stopped given concern for drug rash.
   Again with yeast in urine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for suspected ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, right lower extremity edema, hypotension, respiratory failure, hyponatremia, malnutrition, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient's current medications include cefepime, steroids, protonix, heparin, and various other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient has been experiencing distension and tympanicity in the abdomen since October 30th, but there has been some improvement. The patient is tolerating tube feedings and has produced some stool. The plan is to increase the tube feedings to 40cc/hr by November 9th and continue with bowel regimen, abdominal exams, and possibly pulling the nasogastric tube.
2. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient had coffee grounds noted on November 3rd, but it has now resolved. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are stable, so no transfusion is required at this time. The plan is to continue with proton pump inhibitor and treat any bleeding with tranexamic acid and/or endoscopic intervention.
3. Right Lower Extremity (RLE) Edema: The patient"

   reglan
   2.  UGIB/coffee grounds
 noted on [**11-3**], now resolved, hct stable.
   - po ppi
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23, caution given initiation of heparin on
   [**11-8**] for dvt
   - hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if hct/
   bleed remains stable
   3. RLE edema
 LE dvt, started heparin [**11-8**]
   - start coumadin 2mg
   - initiate lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight (concern
   for bleeding)
   4.  Hypotension
 intermittent pressors [**Date range (1) 6498**], concern for septic
   shock vs adrenal insufficiency, ECHO [**11-2**] showed no RWMA, nl EF.
   Remains on broad spectrum abx and stress dose steroids (started [**11-2**]),
   now off pressors for nearly 1 week.
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - considering lasix PO start for anasarca, will wait until [**11-10**]
   - increase beta blocker today
   - decrease steroids to prednisone 7.5mg for [**11-10**] and [**11-11**], then
   decrease to 5mg [**11-12**] and [**11-13**]
   5.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure associated with tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and ventilator dependency. The patient also has an ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) that has resolved, right lower extremity (RLE) edema due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, respiratory failure caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria (ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter), hyponatremia, malnutrition, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids. He is also receiving treatment for a urinary tract infection (UTI), yeast in urine, and a possible drug rash. Other medical issues include heart failure, eosinophilia, and strongyloidiasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a high risk for developing pneumonia due to his dependence on the ventilator and tracheostomy.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has an established DVT in the RLE. There is a risk of developing more DVTs due to immobilization and his underlying peripheral vascular disease.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: A potential complication of DVT is"

   - continue lovenox
   5.  Hypotension.  Had hypotension intermittently requiring pressors
   [**Date range (1) 6498**]. T here was concern for septic shock.  Echo showed no
   regional wall motion abnormalities.  He was known to have pneumonia.
   Now normotensive off pressors for one week.  Was on stress dose
   steroids.
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - considering lasix PO start for anasarca, will wait until [**11-10**]
   - continue beta blocker for improved rate controle
   - decrease steroids to prednisone 7.5mg for [**11-10**] and [**11-11**], then
   decrease to 5mg [**11-12**] and [**11-13**]
   6.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime.
   - abx to continue to [**11-10**] (7ds from [**11-3**], when cxs grew, as per ID)
   - trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
   - f/u ID recs

   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime now with DVT, on
   lovenox.
   1.  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with
   NGT suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube
   feeds at goal.
   - TFs increase to 60cc/hr by [**11-10**]
   - bowel regimen
   - start ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids, cont
   reglan
   2.  UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in NG suctioning
   on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning, now resolved.
   - po ppi
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23, caution given initiation of heparin on
   [**11-8**] for dvt
   - hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if hct/
   bleed remains stable
   3. RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   - continue coumadin 2mg
   - continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight (concern
   for bleeding)
   4.  A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   - increase BB
   - continue lovenox
   5.  Hypotension.  Had hypotension intermittently requiring pressors
   [**Date range (1) 6498**]. T here was concern for septic shock.  Echo showed no
   regional wall motion abnormalities.  He was known to have pneumonia.
   Now normotensive off pressors for one week.  Was on stress dose
   steroids.
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - considering lasix PO start for anasarca, will wait until [**11-10**]
   - continue beta blocker for improved rate controle
   - decrease steroids to prednisone 7.5mg for [**11-10**] and [**11-11**], then
   decrease to 5mg [**11-12**] and [**11-13**]
   6.  Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime.
   - abx to continue to [**11-10**] (7ds from [**11-3**], when cxs grew, as per ID)
   - trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
   - f/u ID recs
   7.  Nutrition - failed S&S, PEG in place.
   - tube feeds at goal
   8.  PD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when NGT is
   removed and hct stable
   - hold opioids due to ileus
   9. HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.
   Found to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. The patient has undergone a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. He is currently being treated for an esophageal infection caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient also has deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. He is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and is on beta-blockers for rate control. The patient has a history of ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with coffee grounds, and right lower extremity (RLE) DVT. He has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is receiving hemodialysis. The patient's recent lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, and potassium, indicating renal dysfunction. He is also hypocalcemic and anemic. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient had an ileus since October 30th, which has now resolved with NGT suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids. However, the patient is still on tube feeds and may be at risk of developing another episode of ileus.
2. UGIB/Coffee Grounds: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, and PVD who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is now experiencing ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), right lower extremity (RLE) edema, hypotension, respiratory failure caused by pneumonia (pna) with ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, hyponatremia, malnutrition, peripheral vascular disease (PD), and urinary tract infection (UTI) with yeast in urine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus - The patient has distention and tympanitic abdomen, indicating a possible ileus. This can be managed by increasing tube feeds gradually, implementing a bowel regimen, and using medications such as ultram for pain relief.
2. UGIB - The patient had coffee grounds on [11-3] but has since resolved. It is important to continue with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and monitor hemoglobin levels closely.
3. RLE edema - The patient has developed edema in the right lower extremity, which may indicate deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Heparin and coumadin have been initiated, and lovenox will be started at a low dose based on dry weight.
4. Hypotension - The patient has"

   on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning, now resolved.
   - po ppi
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23, caution given initiation of heparin on
   [**11-8**] for dvt
   - hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if hct/
   bleed remains stable
   3. RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   - continue coumadin 2mg

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient has several medical complications, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient's recent events include an ileus that has now resolved, coffee grounds in the nasogastric tube suctioning, and a right lower extremity DVT. He is currently on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and transitioning to lovenox. The patient also experienced hypotension requiring pressors but is now normotensive off pressors for one week. He was on a stress dose of steroids.

The patient has a history of pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, which is now resistant to bactrim, so he is being treated with cefepime. He also has worsening bilateral pleural effusions that have reaccumulated following thoracentesis.

Other findings include hyponatremia initially thought to be SIADH but now attributed to tube feeds, and advanced nutrition support with tube feeds at goal. The patient's peripheral vascular disease has resulted in dry gangrene of the left lower extremity, and he is awaiting revascularization.

The patient's medications include metoprolol, heparin, lovenox"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. He has now developed ileus and is tolerating tube feedings. The patient has been diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii infections, both of which are multidrug-resistant. He has been treated with meropenem and cefepime antibiotics. The patient also has hyponatremia, which is being managed with free water boluses. He has chronic kidney disease and is on hemodialysis. There is a concern for deep vein thrombosis in his left leg, and he has been started on heparin and lovenox. The patient has a history of strongyloidiasis and has been treated with ivermectin. He also has eosinophilia, which may be a drug reaction. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, enoxaparin, and various antibiotics. He is still on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids. The patient has been weaned off the ventilator and is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support. He has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status and is expected to be in the ICU until he can be transferred to a rehabilitation facility.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and tracheostomy. They have been on mechanical ventilation and have a tracheostomy. The patient's bed availability in rehab has been delayed but is expected to open soon. Metoprolol dosage was increased to 25 mg TID. A chest X-ray showed increasing left effusion. The patient's vital signs remain relatively stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/57 mmHg to 140/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a pressure of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 53. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.32. The patient's labs show a WBC count ranging from 6.6 to 10.1 K/uL, Hct ranging from 28.2 to 32.1%, and platelet count ranging from 347 to 382 K/uL. Other lab results include elevated D-dimer, lactic acid, and LDH levels, as well as low albumin and fibrinogen levels. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, and they have allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's disposition is currently unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which could lead to further complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or tracheostomy-related infections.
2. Increasing left effusion: The chest X-ray indicates an increasing left effusion, which could be due to heart failure, infection, or malignancy. This could potentially worsen the patient's respiratory status and lead to additional complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding, especially considering the use of anticoagulants like enoxaparin.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.
5. DNR status: The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status, indicating that they do not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest. This should guide the medical team's approach to treatment decisions.
6. Delayed rehab bed availability: The delayed availability of a bed in rehab may result in prolonged ICU stay and associated complications."

   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime now with DVT on
   enox and coumadin. He spiked a fever this AM with worsening CXR (left
   sided).
    > Fevers: fever today to 100.5 on prednisone and Tylenol ATC with
   worsening CXR. Will need to re-send sputum, blood and urine clx and
   cont the current coverage for now. His skin exam is actually improved
   since [**10-27**] although presumably the gangrene alone could cause low grade
   fever.  Other possibilities include DVT which he has in the right leg
   as well as drug effect and pancreatitis.
   - Check blood, urine, sputum and c.dif
   - CT scan (I+) given worsening CXR to r/o empyema
   -cont broad coverage, defer additional Abx

   Total time spent: 35 minutes; patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical complications.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, which initially led to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by the development of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right leg, for which anticoagulation therapy with heparin and enoxaparin has been initiated.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and has experienced episodes of hypotension requiring vasopressors. An echocardiogram showed no regional wall motion abnormalities, indicating no evidence of acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction.

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with ileus, which has now resolved with nasogastric tube suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioid use. The patient is tolerating tube feeds at goal.

The patient has a history of coffee grounds in the nasogastric suctioning, likely secondary to prolonged nasogastric tube use, but this has resolved with stable hematocrit levels.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactic acid levels. Other lab results, including kidney and"

   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime now with DVT, on
   lovenox.
    > Fevers: fever today to 100.5 on prednisone and Tylenol ATC with
   worsening CXR. Will need to re-send sputum, blood and urine clx and
   cont the current coverage for now. His skin exam is actually improved
   since [**10-27**] although presumably the gangrene alone could cause low grade
   fever.  Other possibilities include DVT which he has in the right leg.
   - Check blood, urine, sputum and c.dif
   -cont broad coverage, defer additional Abx
   - defer thoracentesis.
   - add differential
   >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with NGT
   suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube feeds
   at goal.
   - TFs increase to 60cc/hr by [**11-10**]
   - bowel regimen
   - start ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids, cont
   reglan
   >  UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in NG suctioning
   on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning, now resolved.
   - po ppi
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23, caution given initiation of heparin on
   [**11-8**] for dvt
   - hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if hct/
   bleed remains stable
   > RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   - continue coumadin 2mg
   - continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight (concern
   for bleeding)
   > A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   - titraitng BB
   - continue lovenox
   >  Hypotension.  Had hypotension intermittently requiring pressors
   [**Date range (1) 6498**]. T here was concern for septic shock.  Echo showed no
   regional wall motion abnormalities.  He was known to have pneumonia.
   Now normotensive off pressors for one week.  Was on stress dose
   steroids.
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - considering lasix PO start for anasarca, will wait until [**11-10**]
   - continue beta blocker for improved rate control
   - decrease steroids to prednisone 7.5mg for [**11-10**] and [**11-11**], then
   decrease to 5mg [**11-12**] and [**11-13**]
   >Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime.
   - abx to finish [**11-13**] (7ds from [**11-3**], when cxs grew, as per ID)
   - trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
   >  PVD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when NGT is
   removed and hct stable
   - hold opioids due to ileus
   > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.  Found
   to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.
   - hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix in future

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and recent respiratory failure.
- He has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia and sepsis.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and chronic kidney disease.
- His current medications include cefepime, heparin, lovenox, prednisone, Tylenol, and a proton pump inhibitor.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, blood pressure ranging from 102/49 to 135/74 mmHg, heart rate between 83-109 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- Physical examination reveals crackles at the lung bases, diminished peripheral pulses, and improved skin condition.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and low platelet count.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening pulmonary infiltrates.
- The patient's assessment and plan include continued broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, re-sending sputum, blood, and urine cultures, checking for Clostridioides difficile infection, and monitoring for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis, ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/[**Month/Year (2) 1008**] with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime now with DVT on
   enox and coumadin. He spiked a fever this AM with worsening CXR (left
   sided).
    > Fevers: fever today to 100.5 on prednisone and Tylenol ATC with
   worsening CXR. Will need to re-send sputum, blood and urine clx and
   cont the current coverage for now. His skin exam is actually improved
   since [**10-27**] although presumably the gangrene alone could cause low grade
   fever.  Other possibilities include DVT which he has in the right leg
   as well as drug effect and pancreatitis.
   - Check blood, urine, sputum and c.dif
   - CT scan (I-) given worsening CXR
   -cont broad coverage, defer additional Abx
   - defer thoracentesis until CT scan
   - add differential to CBC, check lipase
   >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with NGT
   suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube feeds
   at goal.
   - TFs increase to 60cc/hr by [**11-10**]
   - bowel regimen
   - start ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids, cont
   reglan
   >  UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in NG suctioning
   on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning, now resolved
   with stable Hct
   - po ppi
   - [**Hospital1 **] hcts, transfuse if <23, caution given initiation of heparin on
   [**11-8**] for dvt
   - hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if hct/
   bleed remains stable
   > RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   - continue coumadin 2mg
   - continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight (concern
   for bleeding)
   > A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   - titraitng BB
   - continue lovenox
   >  Hypotension.  Had hypotension intermittently requiring pressors
   [**Date range (1) 6498**]. T here was concern for septic shock.  Echo showed no
   regional wall motion abnormalities.  He was known to have pneumonia.
   Now normotensive off pressors for one week.  Was on stress dose
   steroids no weaning steroids (Po prednisone)
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - considering lasix PO start for anasarca (waiting until we can ramp up
   beta blocker)
   - continue beta blocker for improved rate control
   - decrease steroids to prednisone 7.5mg for [**11-10**] and [**11-11**], then
   decrease to 5mg [**11-12**] and [**11-13**]
   >Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime, now concerned
   for left effusion, worsening infiltrate concerned for empyema.
   - abx to finish [**11-13**] (7ds from [**11-3**], when cxs grew, as per ID)
   - trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
   >  PVD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when NGT is
   removed and hct stable
   - hold opioids due to ileus
    > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given ileus.
   Found to have elevated BNP.  Also with pulmonary edema on bronch.
   - hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix in future

    > Fevers: fever today to 100.5 on prednisone and Tylenol ATC with
   worsening CXR. Will need to re-send sputum, blood and urine clx and
   cont the current coverage for now. His skin exam is actually improved
   since [**10-27**] although presumably the gangrene alone could cause low grade
   fever.  Other possibilities include DVT which he has in the right leg
   as well as drug effect and pancreatitis.
   - Check blood, urine, sputum and c.dif
   - CT scan (I+) given worsening CXR to r/o empyema
   -cont broad coverage, defer additional Abx

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for an extended stay due to various medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and chronic atrial fibrillation. He also has chronic kidney disease, anasarca (fluid retention), and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) indicating diastolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Empyema: The worsening left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray suggests a possible empyema, which is a collection of pus in the pleural space. This can occur as a complication of pneumonia.
2. DVT: The patient has developed a DVT in his right leg, which is a clot that has formed in a deep vein. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges.
3. UGIB: The presence of coffee grounds in the NG suctioning indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely secondary to prolonged NG tube placement. This could lead to significant blood loss and anemia.
4. Ileus: The patient had an ileus since October 30th, which is a condition where the intestines stop working properly. It can cause abdominal distention and other"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent respiratory failure with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He is currently being treated for an ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, as well as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on enoxaparin and warfarin.

2. The patient has been experiencing fevers, with the highest recorded temperature of 100.5°F on prednisone and Tylenol. His skin exam has improved since October 27th, but there is still a possibility of drug effect or pancreatitis due to negative eosinophils and lipase levels.

3. The patient had an ileus since October 30th, which has now resolved with NG tube suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids. He is tolerating tube feeds at goal.

4. The patient had coffee grounds in NG suctioning on November 3rd, likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning. This has since resolved.

5. The patient has a right lower extremity DVT, for which anticoagulation with heparin was started on November 8th. He was then transitioned to low-m"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and recent respiratory failure who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube, has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition, and is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics for an infection caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. The patient's recent progress includes an improvement in skin exam, resolution of ileus with NG suctioning, and stabilization of hypotension without the need for pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of infections caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. There is a concern for worsening pneumonia and pleural effusion, which may require further investigation and treatment.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a right lower extremity DVT and is receiving anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin and warfarin.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: There is a risk of developing pulmonary embolism due to the DVT. Close monitoring and ongoing anticoagulation are important.
4. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension requiring pressors, but is currently normotensive. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure stability.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient has been experiencing various complications, including pneumonia with Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species, worsening bilateral pleural effusions, ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, hyponatremia, malnutrition, and a urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to the worsening bilateral pleural effusions and potential development of lung abscess or empyema.
2. Sepsis: The patient has an ongoing infection with Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock, especially considering his immunocompromised state and previous exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed DVT in the right lower extremity, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not appropriately managed.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the patient's upper gastrointestinal bleeding has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent bleeding due to his use of anticoagulation therapy and the presence of stress ulcers.
5. Malnutrition"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with necrotizing pneumonia in the right lung and a loculated left pleural effusion. The patient has been febrile, with a temperature of 100.5 degrees Celsius. Cultures were drawn, and a chest X-ray was repeated, which showed possible lung abscess or empyema. A CT scan of the chest confirmed the enlargement of the loculated left pleural effusion and slight improvement in the necrotizing pneumonia in the right lung. There was also obstruction of the airway proximal to the tracheostomy tube due to secretions.

The patient's sats were difficult to pick up but reliably desaturated to the 80s, improving with suctioning, but then dropping down again. The patient was placed back on the vent for a few hours. The PICC line split open, and a replacement order was made along with tip culture sent. The patient has allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient presented with fever, worsening bilateral pleural effusions, and significant abdominal distention. Cultures revealed ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia. The patient also had ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), right lower extremity edema, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress-dose steroids. The patient's condition improved initially but then deteriorated, with the development of fever, worsening infiltrate on chest X-ray, and no improvement in bowel function. The patient's temperature spiked to 101°F, and there were no new physical exam findings of cellulitis.

The plan was to continue with the current antibiotics until [**11-13**], but the ID team will review the plan due to the patient's temperature rise. The tracheostomy mask will be kept in place.

Other medical complications include hyponatremia, which is thought to be caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The patient is being monitored with serial electrolyte levels and receiving free water bolus every"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old man with CAD, PVD and chronic nonhealing ulcers, with a
   complicated hospitalization most notable for recurrent
   ventilator-associated pneumonias, now with new respiratory failure from
   a night right lung VAP
   1.       Respiratory failure: very likely from new right lung VAP;
   volume overload may be contributing; has numerous resistant organisms
   on prior sputum/BAL cultures and has been lacking adequate
   gram-positive coverage, in part due to allergies
   -          Will discuss broadening gram positive coverage (?
   tigecycline or linezolid) with ID
   -          Bronchoscopy this AM; f/u new sputum culture
   -          Vent support as needed
   2.       Hypotension; likely from pneumonia/sepsis as above, though
   adrenal insufficiency could be contributing (especially considering he
   just finished course of corticosteroids); pleural effusion not
   consistent with empyema
   -          resume methylprednisolone
   -          IV fluid boluses as needed; low threshold to add vasopressor
   support
   -          Hold beta blockers for now
   3.       Fevers: likely pulmonary source as above
   -          reculture blood, urine, sputum; send stool for C Diff toxin
   -          will empirically add IV metronidazole pending C Diff toxin
   assay
   4.       DVT
   -          cont enoxaparin but hold warfarin given the likelihood of
   him needing an additional invasive procedure
   5.       Atrial fibrillation
   -          hold beta blockade and warfarin as above; cont enoxaparin
   6.       Ileus; resolving
   -          cont metoclopramide and follow abdominal exam; minimize
   opiods
   7.       PVD
   -          cont current analgesia regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who has been admitted to the ICU with recurrent ventilator-associated/hospital-acquired pneumonias. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to a new right lung VAP, volume overload, and has undergone a thoracentesis which showed a transudative effusion without evidence of empyema. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, fever, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation, ileus, and chronic nonhealing ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the new right lung VAP and volume overload. He will require ventilator support as needed, bronchoscopy to evaluate the airways, and a follow-up sputum culture.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely caused by pneumonia/sepsis. It could also be related to adrenal insufficiency, especially since he recently completed a course of corticosteroids. Treatment options include resuming methylprednisolone, administering IV fluid boluses, and adding vasopressor support if necessary.
3. Fevers: The patient's fevers are likely of pulmonary origin. Reculture blood, urine, and sputum, and send stool for C Diff toxin assay. Empirically add IV metron"

   > Fevers: fever today to 101.5 with worsening CXR. Will need to re-send
   sputum, blood and urine clx and cont the current coverage for now. His
   skin exam is actually improved since [**10-27**] although presumably the
   gangrene alone could cause low grade fever.  Other possibilities
   include DVT which he has in the right leg as well as drug effect and
   pancreatitis (neg Eos and lipase) on recent check. The thoracentesis
   has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it appears to be most
   consistent with a transudative effusion with benign pH. We will need to
   re-consider gram positive coverage in this setting and will d/w with ID
   - Check blood, urine, sputum and c.dif

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including febrile neutropenia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute kidney injury (AKI), ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and abdominal distention. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter baumannii infection. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure, worsening bilateral pleural effusions, and significant abdominal distention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. The worsening bilateral pleural effusions and increasing infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate a possible progression towards respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients. It can lead to worsening respiratory function and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed DVT in the right leg, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation therapy is being continued to prevent further clot formation.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has AKI with elevated serum creatinine levels. This can be caused by hypotension, sepsis, and nephrotoxic drugs. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Ileus: The patient had an ileus since October 30th, which has now resolved with NGT suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids. However, there is a concern for recurrence due to continued use of opioids and potential reintroduction of NGT.
6. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient had coffee grounds in NG suctioning on November 3rd, likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning. This can lead to upper GI bleeding and require treatment with proton pump inhibitors and caution with aspirin and other antiplatelet agents.
7. Abdominal Distention: The patient has significant abdominal distention, which can be caused by ileus, bowel obstruction, or fluid accumulation. It may increase the risk of respiratory compromise and should be evaluated further.
8. Sepsis: The patient has signs of ongoing infection, including fever and leukocytosis. Sepsis can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and requires prompt identification and management.
9. Gangrene: The patient has dry gangrene of the right lower extremity, which is associated with peripheral vascular disease. Amputation may be necessary if the gangrene"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with an ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia and has developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He has also had an ileus since October 30th, which has now resolved. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, and anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin and warfarin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure due to pneumonia and pleural effusions.
2. Complications related to DVT, such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Potential for further deterioration in renal function.
4. Risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy.
5. Possible recurrence of ileus.
6. Gangrene of the lower extremities.
7. Hypotension and septic shock.
8. Acute kidney injury.
9. Electrolyte imbalances.
10. Potential need for further surgical interventions, such as chest tube placement or amputation of the affected limbs.

   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime now with DVT on
   enox . He spiked a fever this [**11-14**] with worsening CXR (left sided)
   infiltrate and hypotension.
   > Fevers: fever today to 101.5 with worsening CXR. Will need to re-send
   sputum, blood and urine clx and cont the current coverage for now. His
   skin exam is actually improved since [**10-27**] although presumably the
   gangrene alone could cause low grade fever. The thoracentesis on [**11-13**]
   has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it appears to be most
   consistent with a transudative effusion with benign pH. We will need to
   re-consider gram positive coverage in this setting and will d/w with
   ID.  Other possibilities include DVT which he has in the right leg as
   well as drug effect and pancreatitis (neg Eos and lipase) on recent
   check [**11-13**].
   - Check blood, urine, sputum and c.dif
   -cont broad coverage, defer additional Abx until we speak with ID about
   gram positive coverage: ?tigecycline
   - restart hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q 12h pending further investigation
   of sepsis
    >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with
   NGT suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube
   feeds at goal with reglan for promotility
   - bowel regimen
   - ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids, cont reglan
    >  UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in NG suctioning
   on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning, now resolved
   with stable Hct
   - po ppi
   - hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if hct/
   bleed remains stable
   > RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   - continue coumadin 2mg (hold for now) given possible need for
   procedures
   - continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight (concern
   for bleeding)
   > A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   - titraitng BB (but holding in the setting of hypotension)
   - continue lovenox
    >  Hypotension.  Had hypotension intermittently requiring pressors
   [**Date range (1) 6498**] and not again on [**11-14**] in the setting of new fever and
   concern for sepsis. He had been on  stress dose steroids and we had
   weaned to off on 11.25 but now restart IV steroids.  Notably he may
   require pressors again soon he is markedly volume sensitive as
   exhibited by failreu to tolerate PEEP this AM (became hypotensive)
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - holding lasix
   - stress steroids
   >Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime,, His left sided
   effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on [**11-13**] and was transudative. Concerns
   remain for a necrotic process in the lung bases as a stimulus for new
   fever with limited ability to clear despite empiric tx. He is also
   complicated by profound volume overload and weakness (exacerbated by
   over all deconditioning, prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).
   -  abx  WERE to finish [**11-13**] (7ds from [**11-3**], when cxs grew, as per ID,
   but based on fever andf hypotension  we will continue and d/w ID re:
   empiric tx of GPC which have appeared on the gram stain but not clx
   from sputum.
   - trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
    >  PVD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when NGT is
   removed and hct stable
   - hold opioids due to ileus
    > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given hypotension,
   although he is total body vol up..  Found to have elevated BNP.  Also
   with pulmonary edema on bronch from [**11-2**].
   - hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix in future

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and recent respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- The patient has been diagnosed with an ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, for which he was initially on cefepime.
- He has developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right leg and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin.
- The patient's skin exam shows multiple areas of skin breakdown, likely due to prolonged immobility and pressure ulcers.
- He has had an ileus since October 30th, which has now resolved with the use of NGT suctioning, bowel rest, and reglan for promotility.
- The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to prolonged NG suctioning, but it has since resolved.
- He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is receiving anticoagulation therapy.
- The patient's blood pressure has been intermittently low and requires the use of pressors.
- He has bilateral pleural effusions that have reaccumulated following thoracentesis, and one of the effusions was tapped and found to be transudative.
- The patient has abdominal distention and is experiencing"

   consistent with a transudative effusion with benign pH. We will need to
   re-consider gram positive coverage in this setting and will d/w with
   ID.  Other possibilities include DVT which he has in the right leg as
   well as drug effect and pancreatitis (neg Eos and lipase) on recent

   [**Date range (1) 6498**] and not again on [**11-14**] in the setting of new fever and
   concern for sepsis. He had been on  stress dose steroids and we had
   weaned to off on 11.25 but now restart IV steroids.  Notably he may
   require pressors again soon he is markedly volume sensitive as
   exhibited by failreu to tolerate PEEP this AM (became hypotensive)

   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime,, His left sided
   effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on [**11-13**] and was transudative. Concerns
   remain for a necrotic process in the lung bases as a stimulus for new
   fever with limited ability to clear despite empiric tx. He is also
   complicated by profound volume overload and weakness (exacerbated by
   over all deconditioning, prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure who has been admitted to the ICU. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with an ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii infection, for which he was initially treated with cefepime. However, his condition has worsened, with fever and hypotension, indicating possible sepsis. The patient also has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) for anticoagulation. He is also experiencing hypotension, likely due to volume overload and adrenal insufficiency, as well as abdominal distention. The patient's left-sided pleural effusion was tapped, revealing a transudative effusion. His kidney function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, meropenem, and vancomycin, but still exhibits signs of infection. There is concern for a necrotic process in the lung bases and limited ability to clear the infection despite empiric treatment. The patient's skin is warm but shows multiple areas of skin breakdown. His neurological status is stable, and he responds to verbal stimuli. The"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Lower Extremity: The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in the lower extremity. This condition involves the formation of a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg, which can potentially lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism if not managed properly.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO), Intussusception, Adhesions: The patient has been assessed with small bowel obstruction, including intussusception and adhesions. Small bowel obstruction occurs when there is a blockage in the small intestine, leading to impaired movement of food and fluid. Intussusception refers to one part of the intestine sliding into another part, causing an obstruction. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that can form after surgery and can also lead to bowel obstruction.

3. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) with Critical Limb Ischemia: The patient is diagnosed with PVD, a condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the limbs due to narrowed or blocked arteries. Critical limb ischemia indicates severe blockages causing insufficient blood supply to the affected limb, putting it at risk of tissue death and amputation.

4. Pain Control: The patient requires management of both acute and chronic pain. This may involve the use of analgesics and other pain relief strategies.

5. Anemia, Other"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old man with CAD, PVD and chronic nonhealing ulcers, with a
   complicated hospitalization most notable for recurrent
   ventilator-associated pneumonias, now with persistent respiratory
   failure possibly from a new right lung VAP
   1.       Respiratory failure: possibly from new right lung VAP; volume
   overload likely contributing; has numerous resistant organisms on prior
   sputum/BAL cultures and has been lacking adequate gram-positive
   coverage, in part due to allergies
   -          Cont current regimen of meropenem/cefepime (increased dose)
   pending sputum culture results; ID input appreciated
   -          Would likely benefit from diuresis but will hold off now
   given recent hypotension; if BP remains stable, will consider Lasix
   later this afternoon
   -          Vent support as needed
   2.       Hypotension; likely from pneumonia/sepsis as above, though
   adrenal insufficiency could be contributing (especially considering he
   just finished course of corticosteroids); pleural effusion not
   consistent with empyema
   -          cont methylprednisolone
   -          IV fluid boluses (switch to LR) as needed; low threshold to
   add vasopressor support
   -          Cont to hold beta blockers for now
   3.       Anemia; source unclear
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          Rpt Hct and consider pRBC transfusion (likely with Lasix) if
   remains low
   4.       Fevers: likely pulmonary source as above; afebrile now for 24
   hrs, though steroids could be masking fevers
   -          Follow up pending micro data; resend C Diff
   -          f/u ID recs
   -          Cont current antibiotics for now; can likely d/c
   metronidazole if C Diff remains negative
   5.       DVT
   -          cont enoxaparin but hold warfarin given the likelihood of
   him needing an additional invasive procedure
   6.       Atrial fibrillation
   -          hold beta blockade and warfarin as above; cont enoxaparin
   7.       Ileus; resolving
   -          cont metoclopramide and follow abdominal exam; minimize
   opiods
   8.       PVD
   -          cont current analgesia regimen

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic nonhealing ulcers. The patient has been hospitalized and experienced recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAP). Currently, the patient is in respiratory failure, possibly due to a new right lung VAP and volume overload. 

The patient's current plan of care includes continuing current antibiotics pending sputum culture results, considering diuretics for volume overload, and providing vent support as needed. The patient's hypotension is likely due to pneumonia/sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency could be a contributing factor. 

Additionally, the patient has anemia, fevers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation, ileus, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient may experience worsening respiratory failure, further episodes of hypotension, worsening anemia, development of a clot-related complication from the DVT, or worsening of the atrial fibrillation."

   infiltrate and hypotension.
   > Fevers: fever today to 101.5 with worsening CXR. Will need to re-send
   sputum, blood and urine clx and cont the current coverage for now. His
   skin exam is actually improved since [**10-27**] although presumably the
   gangrene alone could cause low grade fever. The thoracentesis on [**11-13**]
   has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it appears to be most
   consistent with a transudative effusion with benign pH. We will need to
   re-consider gram positive coverage in this setting and will d/w with
   ID.  Other possibilities include DVT which he has in the right leg as
   well as drug effect and pancreatitis (neg Eos and lipase) on recent
   check [**11-13**].

   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   - continue coumadin 2mg (hold for now) given possible need for

   [**Date range (1) 6498**] and not again on [**11-14**] in the setting of new fever and
   concern for sepsis. He had been on  stress dose steroids and we had
   weaned to off on 11.25 but now restart IV steroids.  Notably he may
   require pressors again soon he is markedly volume sensitive as
   exhibited by failreu to tolerate PEEP this AM (became hypotensive)
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - holding lasix
   - stress steroids
   >Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime,, His left sided
   effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on [**11-13**] and was transudative. Concerns
   remain for a necrotic process in the lung bases as a stimulus for new
   fever with limited ability to clear despite empiric tx. He is also
   complicated by profound volume overload and weakness (exacerbated by
   over all deconditioning, prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).
   -  abx  WERE to finish [**11-13**] (7ds from [**11-3**], when cxs grew, as per ID,

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia and is being treated with cefepime. He also has a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is on enoxaparin. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, worsening chest X-ray, hypotension, ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and coffee grounds in the nasogastric tube suctioning. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is getting anticoagulated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and worsening chest X-ray suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. DVT: The patient has been diagnosed with a right lower extremity DVT and is on enoxaparin.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has signs of pulmonary edema on bronch from [**11-2**].
4. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive requiring pressors.

   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime now with DVT on
   enox . He spiked a fever this [**11-14**] with worsening CXR (left sided)
   infiltrate and hypotension.
   > Fevers: fever today to 101.5 with worsening CXR. Will need to re-send
   sputum, blood and urine clx and cont the current coverage for now. His
   skin exam is actually improved since [**10-27**] although presumably the
   gangrene alone could cause low grade fever. The thoracentesis on [**11-13**]
   has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it appears to be most
   consistent with a transudative effusion with benign pH. We will need to
   re-consider gram positive coverage in this setting and will d/w with
   ID.  Other possibilities include DVT which he has in the right leg as
   well as drug effect and pancreatitis (neg Eos and lipase) on recent
   check [**11-13**].
   - Check blood, urine, sputum and c.dif
   -cont broad coverage, defer additional Abx until we speak with ID about
   gram positive coverage: ?tigecycline
   - restart hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q 12h pending further investigation
   of sepsis
    >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with
   NGT suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube
   feeds at goal with reglan for promotility
   - bowel regimen
   - ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids, cont reglan
    >  UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in NG suctioning
   on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning, now resolved
   with stable Hct
   - po ppi
   - hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if hct/
   bleed remains stable
   > RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   - continue coumadin 2mg (hold for now) given possible need for
   procedures
   - continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight (concern
   for bleeding)
   > A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   - titraitng BB (but holding in the setting of hypotension)
   - continue lovenox
    >  Hypotension.  Had hypotension intermittently requiring pressors
   [**Date range (1) 6498**] and not again on [**11-14**] in the setting of new fever and
   concern for sepsis. He had been on  stress dose steroids and we had
   weaned to off on 11.25 but now restart IV steroids.  Notably he may
   require pressors again soon he is markedly volume sensitive as
   exhibited by failreu to tolerate PEEP this AM (became hypotensive)
   - f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   - holding lasix
   - stress steroids
   >Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime,, His left sided
   effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on [**11-13**] and was transudative. Concerns
   remain for a necrotic process in the lung bases as a stimulus for new
   fever with limited ability to clear despite empiric tx. He is also
   complicated by profound volume overload and weakness (exacerbated by
   over all deconditioning, prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).
   -  abx  WERE to finish [**11-13**] (7ds from [**11-3**], when cxs grew, as per ID,
   but based on fever andf hypotension  we will continue and d/w ID re:
   empiric tx of GPC which have appeared on the gram stain but not clx
   from sputum.
   - trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
    >  PVD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.
   - further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from this
   hospitalization.
   - hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when NGT is
   removed and hct stable
   - hold opioids due to ileus
    > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given hypotension,
   although he is total body vol up..  Found to have elevated BNP.  Also
   with pulmonary edema on bronch from [**11-2**].
   - hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix in future

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities and complications.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever
- Worsening chest X-ray (CXR) showing left-sided infiltrate
- Hypotension
- DVT in the right leg
- Transudative pleural effusion
- Ileus
- Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with coffee grounds in NG suctioning
- Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (RLE DVT)
- Atrial fibrillation (A. fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR)
- Hypotension requiring pressors
- Respiratory failure due to pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter baumannii
- Bilateral pleural effusions that have reaccumulated after thoracentesis
- Abdominal distention
- Profound volume overload and weakness

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, worsening CXR, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggest the possibility of sepsis. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and monitor for signs of infection.
2. Pulmonary emb"

   > Fevers: fever today to 101.5 with worsening CXR. Will need to re-send
   sputum, blood and urine clx and cont the current coverage for now. His
   skin exam is actually improved since [**10-27**] although presumably the
   gangrene alone could cause low grade fever. The thoracentesis on [**11-13**]
   has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it appears to be most
   consistent with a transudative effusion with benign pH. We will need to
   re-consider gram positive coverage in this setting and will d/w with

   well as drug effect and pancreatitis (neg Eos and lipase) on recent

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and recent respiratory failure with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing fevers and worsening chest X-ray infiltrates, indicating a possible infection. There is a concern for sepsis, especially considering the presence of fever and hypotension. Further investigation is needed, including re-sending sputum, blood, and urine cultures.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in the right leg and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin (lovenox). This is likely secondary to prolonged immobilization.

3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient had coffee grounds in NG suctioning on November 3rd, which resolved with stable hemoglobin (Hct) levels. Prophylaxis for UGIB includes pantoprazole (PPI) and avoiding aspirin and clopidogrel.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has pneumonia caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, which has led to bilateral pleural effusions. The eff"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to an infection caused by ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and other complications.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fevers: The patient is currently afebrile, and the chest X-ray (CXR) shows no change from yesterday. However, the patient will need to follow up with sputum, blood, and urine cultures and continue the current antibiotic coverage for now. The skin exam has improved since admission, although the gangrene alone could cause a low-grade fever.
2. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension intermittently requiring pressors and is now again hypotensive on [11-14] in the setting of a new fever and concern for sepsis. The patient had been on stress dose steroids and was weaned off on 11/25 but now restarted IV steroids. Follow-up culture data, fever curve, and WBC should be monitored. Lasix should be held, and stress steroids should be continued or restarted.

   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime now with DVT on
   enox . He spiked a fever on [**11-14**] with worsening CXR (left sided)
   infiltrate and hypotension
 s/p unremarkable bronch
 now back to
   baseline
   > Fevers: Afebrile today with stable CXR. Will need to f/u sputum,
   blood and urine clx and cont the current coverage for now. His skin
   exam is actually improved since [**10-27**] although presumably the gangrene
   alone could cause low grade fever. The thoracentesis on [**11-13**] has been
   unrevealing in terms of empyema as it appears to be most consistent
   with a transudative effusion with benign pH. ID does not feel that
   patient needs GP coverage or coverage for MDR acinetobacter ([**11-12**]) at
   this time.  If worsens, would consider daptymycin coverage for
   cellulitis/wound infection.  Meanwhile, will complete 14 day course of
   cefepime/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for VAP based on [**11-3**] cultures.
   -          F/U blood, urine, sputum and c.dif
   -          cont broad coverage
   -          On hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q 12h for stress dose steroids.
   Will consider d/c
ing if stable in am.
    >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with
   NGT suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube
   feeds at goal with reglan for promotility
   -          bowel regimen
   -          ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids,
   cont reglan
    >  UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in NG suctioning
   on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning. Now with
   decreased hct of unclear source. Will transfuse 1 unit PRBC and follow
   up repeat hct, would r/o RP bleed.
   -          Serial Hcts
   -          po ppi
   -          hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if
   hct/ bleed remains stable

   > RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   -          continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight
   (concern for bleeding)
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] need to hold if Hct drops again
   > A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   -          titraitng BB (but holding in the setting of hypotension), on
   Lovenox
    >  Hypotension.  Had hypotension intermittently requiring pressors
   [**Date range (1) 6498**] and notwagain on [**11-14**] in the setting of new fever and
   concern for sepsis. He had been on  stress dose steroids and we had
   weaned to off on 11.25 but now restart IV steroids.
   -          f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
   -          holding lasix
   -          sress steroids on methypred 25mg q12h
    > Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Acinetobacter
   now has resistance to bactrim, so switched to cefepime. Not treating
   MDR acinetobacter. Effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on [**11-13**] and was
   transudative. Concerns remain for a necrotic process in the lung bases
   as a stimulus for new fever with limited ability to clear despite
   empiric tx. He is also complicated by profound volume overload and
   weakness (exacerbated by over all deconditioning, prolonged MICU stay
   and courses of steroids).
   -          abx  WERE to finish [**11-13**] (7ds from [**11-3**], when cxs grew, as
   per ID, but based on fever andf hypotension  we will continue until

   -          trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
    >  PVD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.
   -          further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from
   this hospitalization.
   -          hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when
   NGT is removed and hct stable
   -          hold opioids due to ileus
   > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given hypotension,
   although he is total body vol up.  Found to have elevated BNP.  Also
   with pulmonary edema on bronch from [**11-2**].
   -          hold on diuresis for now, but consider lasix in future

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which has required pressor support. The cause of the hypotension is unclear and may be due to sepsis or other factors. Monitoring of blood pressure and continued assessment for signs of sepsis or other causes is important.

2. Decreased hemoglobin (Hct): The patient's Hct has decreased from 30.8 to 24, indicating potential anemia or blood loss. Further investigation into the cause of this drop is necessary, such as assessing for gastrointestinal bleeding or other sources of blood loss.

3. Ileus: The patient has had an ileus since October 30th, which has now resolved with NGT suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids. Monitoring for any signs of recurrent ileus or bowel obstruction is important.

4. Coffee grounds in NG suctioning: The presence of coffee grounds suggests possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Serial Hcts should be followed, and PPI should be continued. Aspirin and Plavix should be held, and consideration should be given to resuming aspirin in the future if Hct and bleeding remain stable.

5. Right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been anticoagulated with heparin and transitioned to Lovenox. Continuous monitoring for signs of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous respiratory failure with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient has been diagnosed with an ESBL-producing Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), hypotension, ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fevers: The patient is currently afebrile with a stable chest X-ray (CXR). Sputum, blood, and urine cultures are needed, and current antibiotic coverage should be continued for now. The skin exam has improved since 10/27, but gangrene alone could cause low-grade fever. Thoracentesis on 11/13 was unrevealing in terms of empyema, consistent with a transudative effusion with benign pH. No growth paste needed for gram stain, acid-fast bacilli (AFB), or fungal culture. ID does not feel that the patient needs gram-positive (GP) coverage or coverage for multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter/stenotrophomonas (11/12).

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, which required the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He also has a transudative pleural effusion, and there is a concern for a necrotic process in the lung bases causing fever. The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the prolonged ICU stay, steroids, and antibiotics, making him susceptible to further infections.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a DVT in his right lower extremity. Anticoagulation therapy has been started with heparin and transitioned to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox).
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient had coffee grounds in NG suctioning, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. He received a unit of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit levels improved. There is a need to monitor his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels closely.
4. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension requiring pressors and is currently on stress dose steroids. This could be due to sepsis or heart failure exacerbation.

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime now with DVT on
   enox . He spiked a fever on [**11-14**] with worsening CXR (left sided)
   infiltrate and hypotension
 s/p unremarkable bronch
 now back to
   baseline
    > Fevers: Afebrile today with stable CXR. Will need to f/u sputum,
   blood and urine clx and cont the current coverage for now. His skin
   exam is actually improved since [**10-27**] although presumably the gangrene
   alone could cause low grade fever. The thoracentesis on [**11-13**] has been
   unrevealing in terms of empyema as it appears to be most consistent
   with a transudative effusion with benign pH. ID does not feel that
   patient needs GP coverage or coverage for MDR
   acinetobacter/stenotrophomonas ([**11-12**]) at this time.  If worsens, would
   consider daptomycin coverage for cellulitis/wound infection.
   Meanwhile, will complete 14 day course of cefepime/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for VAP based
   on [**11-3**] cultures.
   -          F/U blood, urine, sputum and c.diff
   -          cont broad coverage
   -          Decrease hydrocortisone 25mg IV
   >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with NGT
   suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube feeds
   at goal with reglan for promotility
   -          bowel regimen
   -          ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids,
   cont reglan
    >  UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in NG suctioning
   on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning. Now with
   decreased hct of unclear source. S/p 1 unit PRBC with appropriate
   increase in Hct.
   -          Serial Hcts
   -          Po ppi
   -          hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if
   hct/ bleed remains stable
   -          Transfuse for Hct goal >25
   > RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   -          continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight
   (concern for bleeding)
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] need to hold if Hct drops again
   > A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   -          titrating BB
   -          on Lovenox
   >  Hypotension.  Had hypotension intermittently requiring pressors
   [**Date range (1) 6498**] and now again on [**11-14**] in the setting of new fever and
   concern for sepsis. He had been on stress dose steroids and we had
   weaned to off on 11.25 but now restart IV steroids.
   -          f/u culture data, fever curve, wbc
    > Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Not treating
   MDR acinetobacter or stenotrophomonas. Effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on
   [**11-13**] and was transudative. Concerns remain for a necrotic process in
   the lung bases as a stimulus for new fever with limited ability to
   clear despite empiric tx. He is also complicated by profound volume
   overload and weakness (exacerbated by over all deconditioning,
   prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).
    -          abx  WERE to finish [**11-13**] (7ds from [**11-3**], when cxs grew,
   as per ID, but based on fever andf hypotension  we will continue until
   [**11-16**] for 14 day course
   -          trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
    >  PVD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry
   gangrene.
   -          further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from
   this hospitalization.
   -          hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when
   NGT is removed and hct stable
   -          hold opioids due to ileus
   > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given hypotension,
   although he is total body vol up.  Found to have elevated BNP.  Also
   with pulmonary edema on bronch from [**11-2**].
   -          continue with gentle diuresis

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, which is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a possibility of developing antibiotic resistance or recurrence of infection.

2. Bilateral pleural effusions: The patient has worsening bilateral pleural effusions that have reaccumulated following thoracentesis. This could indicate a potential complication such as empyema or pleural infection.

3. Hypotension and sepsis: The patient experienced hypotension intermittently requiring pressors and now again on 11/14 in the setting of a new fever and concern for sepsis. This suggests a possible systemic infection leading to septic shock.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of right lower extremity DVT and is currently receiving low molecular weight heparin for anticoagulation. There is a risk of clot propagation or pulmonary embolism if not properly managed.

5. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has coffee grounds in NG suctioning, likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning. There is a need for further evaluation and management to prevent further bleeding.

6. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with occlusion and is currently in respiratory failure, with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in place. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter species. However, his condition has worsened, and he developed a fever on 11/14 with worsening chest X-ray (left-sided infiltrate) and hypotension. 

The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including:

1. Fevers: The patient was febrile but is now afebrile with stable chest X-ray. Further follow-up with sputum, blood, and urine cultures is required. The current antibiotic coverage will be continued for now.

2. DVT: The patient has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower extremity, which was diagnosed on 11/8. He has been anticoagulated with heparin and transitioned to low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) on 11/9. The dose of enoxaparin will be adjusted based on his dry weight.

3. Hypotension: The patient has had intermittent episodes of hypotension requiring pressors. On 11"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They have a history of low hemoglobin (Hct) and received a unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) yesterday. The patient was given 40 mg of Lasix for diuresis, as their pressures were stable. Overnight, the patient's air movement worsened, so they were placed on pressure support and given inhalers. Steroids were changed to hydrocortisone to decrease the steroid load. No changes were made to their antibiotics.

The patient has allergies to vancomycin, linezolid, and thrombocytopenia. The last doses of antibiotics (Meropenem, metronidazole, and cefepime) were administered on 11/16/2125 at 03:47 AM, 04:00 AM, and 04:15 AM respectively.

Infusions include furosemide (Lasix) given at 12:42 AM on 11/16/2125, and other ICU medications. The patient is receiving tube feeds with Nutren Pulmonary (full) at a rate of 60 mL/hour since 06:35 AM on 11/15/2125.

Vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
- Heart rate: 103 bpm (98-110 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 124/45 mmHg (101"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic nonhealing ulcers. He has had a complicated hospitalization with recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonias and is now experiencing persistent respiratory failure, possibly due to a new right lung ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's current medications include meropenem and cefepime, which are being continued pending sputum culture results. He is also receiving gentle diuresis to improve volume status and lung effusions, as well as vent support as needed.

The patient has hypotension, which may be related to pneumonia/sepsis. He is being treated with hydrocortisone and IV fluid boluses as needed. Beta blockers have been held for now, but may be considered for heart rate control later.

The patient has anemia, and the source is unclear. He responded appropriately to a blood transfusion on 11/15. 

The patient had fevers, likely from a pulmonary source, but is currently afebrile for 48 hours. Steroids could be masking fevers, so follow-up pending micro data is recommended. 

The patient has deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and atrial fibrillation. He is being treated with enoxaparin and warfarin has been held due to the likelihood of needing additional invasive procedures. 

The patient had ile"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic nonhealing ulcers. He has had a complicated hospitalization, including recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonias. Currently, he is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to a new right lung ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has hypotension, anemia, fevers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atrial fibrillation, ileus, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the new right lung VAP is not effectively treated. Adequate antibiotic coverage and supportive care, such as ventilation support, are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis or pneumonia. It is important to maintain fluid balance and provide appropriate hemodynamic support.
3. Anemia: The source of the patient's anemia needs to be identified and addressed. Blood transfusions may be required to manage the anemia.
4. Fevers: The patient's fevers may be due to a pulmonary source, likely the VAP. Monitoring for any signs of infection and sending microbiology data for further analysis is crucial.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for further clot formation. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued, and any invasive procedures should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old man with CAD, PVD and chronic nonhealing ulcers, with a
   complicated hospitalization most notable for recurrent
   ventilator-associated pneumonias, now with persistent respiratory
   failure possibly from a new right lung VAP
   1.       Respiratory failure: possibly from new right lung VAP; volume
   overload likely contributing; has numerous resistant organisms on prior
   sputum/BAL cultures and has been lacking adequate gram-positive
   coverage, in part due to allergies
   -          Cont current regimen of meropenem/cefepime given patient
   pulmonary function has remained stable and he is currently on trach
   with O2 during the day; ID input appreciated in regards to [**11-12**] sputum
   culture
   -          Continue gentle diuresis as pressures tolerate to improve
   volume status and lung effusions
   -          Vent support as needed
   -          Continue inhalers to help with wheezing, may be due to
   volume
   2.       Hypotension; improved on steroids, and increased cefepime dose
   likely from pneumonia/sepsis as above; pleural effusion not consistent
   with empyema
   -          Wean hydrocortisone to 25 mg q12hr
   -          Cont to hold beta blockers for now, if pressures stable
   today with diuresis may consider low dose BB for heart rate control in
   pm
   3.       Anemia; source unclear, responded appropriately to blood
   transfusion [**11-15**]. [**Month (only) 60**] be delayed bleed s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-13**]
   -          Guaiac stools
   -          Trend HCT
   4.       Fevers: likely pulmonary source as above; afebrile now for
   48hrs, though steroids could be masking fevers
   -          Follow up pending micro data; resend C Diff
   -          F/u ID recs
   -          Cont current antibiotics for now; can likely d/c
   metronidazole if C Diff remains negative
   5.       DVT
   -          cont enoxaparin but hold warfarin given the likelihood of
   him needing an additional invasive procedure
   6.       Atrial fibrillation
   -          hold beta blockade and warfarin as above; cont enoxaparin
   7.       Ileus; resolving
   -          cont metoclopramide and follow abdominal exam; minimize
   opiods
   8.       PVD

- The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic non-healing ulcers.
- He has had a complicated hospitalization, including recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonias.
- The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to a new right lung ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- He has volume overload and has been lacking adequate gram-positive coverage due to allergies.
- The patient's pulmonary function has remained stable while on tracheostomy with oxygen during the day.
- Current medications include meropenem, cefepime, metronidazole, furosemide, enoxaparin, and inhalers for wheezing.
- The patient's blood cultures from 11/14 showed Gram-positive cocci, and he was started on daptomycin.
- The patient's last dose of antibiotics was daptomycin on 11/16/25 at 9:00 PM.
- The patient has hypotension, which may be related to pneumonia/sepsis.
- Anemia has been identified but the source is unclear.
- The patient's fevers are likely of pulmonary origin.
- The patient has deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and atrial fibrillation.
- He also has ileus, which is resolving.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old man with CAD, PVD and chronic nonhealing ulcers, with a
   complicated hospitalization most notable for recurrent
   ventilator-associated pneumonias, now with persistent respiratory
   failure possibly from a new right lung VAP
   1.       Respiratory failure: possibly from new right lung VAP; volume
   overload likely contributing; has numerous resistant organisms on prior
   sputum/BAL cultures. Off gram positive coverage due to gram negative
   organisms in sputum cultures, now with positive blood culture on
   Daptomycin.
   -   Meropenem/cefepime/Daptomycin given patient pulmonary function has
   remained stable and he is currently on trach with O2 during the day
   -   Hold on diuresis given new + blood culture.
   -   Vent support as needed
   -   Continue inhalers to help with wheezing, may be due to volume
   2.   Bacteremia: Gram Positive Cocci: unclear source. Chains suggest
   strep or enterococci. Will resend urine culture. Will follow blood
   cultures drawn off PICC from [**11-17**]. Consider bronch for another sputum
   sample. [**Month (only) 60**] be contaminant and patient remains clinically stable.
   -    Daptomycin
   -    Serial blood cultures
   3. Hypotension; improved on steroids, and increased cefepime dose
   likely from pneumonia/sepsis as above; pleural effusion not consistent
   with empyema
   -     Stop stress dose steroids
   -     Cont to hold beta blockers for now, if no more + blood cultures
   over next 24 hrs and pressures remain stable consider restarting BB.
   4. Hypernatremia: likely due to insensible losses
   -   Free water boluses
   5.       Anemia; source unclear, responded appropriately to blood
   transfusion [**11-15**]. [**Month (only) 60**] be delayed bleed s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-13**]

   -    Trend HCT, transfuse HCT <25
   -     Consider bronchoscopy with recent blood around trach. [**Month (only) 60**] be from
   suctioning.
   6.       Fevers: likely pulmonary source as above; afebrile now for
   72hrs, though steroids could be masking fevers
   -    Follow up pending micro data; resend C Diff
   -    F/u ID recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of chronic nonhealing ulcers, coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He has been hospitalized multiple times, including this current admission to the ICU, for recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs). The patient's recent respiratory failure is possibly due to a new right lung VAP and volume overload. He has a positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci in chains, suggesting strep or enterococci, and is currently being treated with daptomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to the new right lung VAP and volume overload. The ventilator support may be necessary.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of Gram-positive cocci in the blood culture indicates bacteremia. It is unclear where the infection originated, and further investigations, such as resending urine culture and following up with blood cultures, are needed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be related to sepsis or pneumonia. Steroids and increased doses of cefepime have been considered to address this issue.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels may be due to insensible losses. Free water boluses may be required to manage this condition.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia responded to blood transfusion but its source remains unclear. Monitoring hem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with an ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and is now experiencing hemoptysis of unclear origin. He also has profound volume overload and weakness, and has had an ileus since October 30th. The patient has coffee grounds in his NG suctioning and has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an appropriate increase in hematocrit (Hct). He has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is currently anticoagulated. The patient has peripheral vascular disease and is awaiting revascularization after discharge. He has stable left lower extremity dry gangrene. His heart failure is diastolic in nature and is associated with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The patient's blood cultures from November 3rd grew gram-positive cocci in chains, and he has been empirically treated with cefepime, meropenem, and metronidazole. He developed a fever on November 14th with worsening chest X-ray (CXR) infiltrates and hypotension, but"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is critically ill with a history of respiratory failure, pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, worsening bilateral pleural effusions, and limited ability to clear the infection despite empiric treatment. The patient is currently on intermittent ventilatory support as needed.

2. Sepsis: The patient has gram-positive cocci in chains growing out of their blood, which may explain the fever and hypotension on November 14th. The source of sepsis is unclear, and the patient will need to follow up with sputum, blood, and urine cultures. Daptomycin has been added to the treatment regimen.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a right lower extremity DVT and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin (Lovenox).

4. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has coffee grounds in their NG suctioning, likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning. They have received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an appropriate increase in hemoglobin concentration.

5. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, indicating impaired renal function.

   > Hemoptysis: Unclear if source is trach site or from lungs. Could
   relate to PNA if that is source of GPC chains.
   -        Bronch today
   > Respiratory failure - pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening bil pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Not treating
   MDR acinetobacter or stenotrophomonas. Effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on
   [**11-13**] and was transudative. Concerns remain for a necrotic process in
   the lung bases as a stimulus for new fever with limited ability to
   clear despite empiric tx. He is also complicated by profound volume
   overload and weakness (exacerbated by over all deconditioning,
   prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).
    -          trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
    > Sepsis: GPC in chains growing out of blood from [**11-15**] that may
   explain fever/hypotension from [**11-14**].  Now afebrile for a few days with
   stable CXR. Will need to f/u sputum, blood and urine clx and add
   daptomycin for now.  Unclear source as PICC line is new on 25^th and no
   evidence of UTI. [**Month (only) 60**] be from new PNA given progression of CXR over past
   few days.  His skin exam is actually improved since [**10-27**]. The
   thoracentesis on [**11-13**] has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it
   appears to be most consistent with a transudative effusion with benign
   pH. ID does not feel that patient needs coverage for MDR
   acinetobacter/stenotrophomonas ([**11-12**]) at this time.  Will complete 14
   day course of cefepime/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for VAP based on [**11-3**] cultures.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and respiratory failure who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, as well as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He also has ileus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with coffee grounds, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hemoptysis: The patient experienced hemoptysis this morning and had transient desaturation. He is now stable on a tracheostomy mask with good oxygen saturations. His respiratory rate is 25-30, and his hematocrit (Hct) is stable after transfusions yesterday.
- Respiratory failure: The patient has been treated for ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, but there is concern for a necrotic process in the lung bases as a stimulus for new fever with limited ability to clear despite empiric treatment. He requires tracheostomy collar and intermittent ventilator support.
- Sepsis: The patient had GPC in chains growing out of blood from November 15th, which may explain the fever and hypotension from November 14th. He is now afebr"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has both upper and lower extremity DVT, which is a serious condition where blood clots form in the deep veins. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism if the clots dislodge and travel to the lungs.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a small bowel obstruction, which can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and inability to pass gas or stool. If not treated promptly, it may lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.

3. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has PVD with critical limb ischemia, indicating poor blood circulation in the extremities. This can result in tissue damage, gangrene, and potentially amputation if not managed appropriately.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which means the lungs are not adequately providing oxygen to the body or removing carbon dioxide. This can be life-threatening and may require long-term ventilatory support.

5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder characterized by rapid and irregular beating. If left untreated, it can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoM CAD, CHF, PVD, s/p resp failure with trach/PEG with vent assoc
   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime, VRE
   bacteremia/sepsis on daptomycin, and LUE/RLE DVT on enox. Requires
   nightly vent assistance for anxiety/tachypnea/diaphoresis.
   > Respiratory failure - Pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening b/l pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentesis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Not treating
   MDR acinetobacter or stenotrophomonas. Effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on
   [**11-13**] and was transudative. He is also complicated by profound volume
   overload and weakness (exacerbated by over all deconditioning,
   prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).  Of note, patient has
   been having very bloody secretions since [**11-14**]
 bronch deferred given
   stable from a respiratory standpoint and likely scope/suctioning trauma
   given anticoagulation.  Now requiring ventilator support, likely due to
   increased volume, capillary leak from low level sepsis and possible
   aspiration given cuff leak.  A new PNA as source of VRE is possible as
   well.
   -          Trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
   -          CXR
   -          Completed 14 day course of Cefepime/[**Last Name (un) **] today
   -          Diuresis as tolerated
    > Bacteremia/Sepsis: VRE growing out of blood from [**11-15**] that may
   explain fever/hypotension from [**11-14**].  Now afebrile for a few days with
   stable CXR. Will need to f/u sputum, blood and urine clx and add
   daptomycin for now.  Unclear source as PICC line is new on 25^th and no
   evidence of UTI. [**Month (only) 60**] be from new PNA given progression of CXR over past
   few days.  His skin exam is actually improved since [**10-27**]. The
   thoracentesis on [**11-13**] has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it
   appears to be most consistent with a transudative effusion with benign
   pH. ID does not feel that patient needs coverage for MDR
   acinetobacter/stenotrophomonas ([**11-12**]) at this time.  Have completed 14
   day course of cefepime/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for VAP based on [**11-3**] cultures.
   -          F/U blood (picc vs peripheral), urine, sputum and c.diff
   -          Continue dapto for VRE
   -          Decrease hydrocortisone 25mg IV
   -          ID said to add colistin if worsens
   > Oliguria/ARF: Likely prerenal, but in the setting of massive
   anasarca.  Now making decent urine.
   -          Check bladder pressure
   -          Gently diurese
   >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with NGT
   suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube feeds
   at goal with reglan for promotility
   -          bowel regimen
   -          ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids,
   cont reglan
    >  Anemia:  H/o UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in
   NG suctioning on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning.
   Now with decreased hct of unclear source, but having hemoptysis. S/p 1
   unit PRBC with downtrending Hct with another unit today.   Possible
   that he is just oozing from various sources given anticoagulation.
   -          Serial Hcts
   -          Po ppi
   -          hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if
   hct/ bleed remains stable
   -          Transfuse for Hct goal >25
   -
   > LUE/RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   -          continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight
   (concern for bleeding)
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] need to hold if Hct drops significantly
   > A. fib.  Has A. fib with RVR.  HR currently in 100s.  Getting
   anticoagulated.
   -          titrating BB
   -          on Lovenox
   >  PVD - awaiting revascularization after DC.  Stable LLE dry gangrene.
   -          further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from
   this hospitalization.
   -          hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when
   NGT is removed and hct stable
   -          hold opioids due to ileus
   > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given hypotension,
   although he is total body vol up.  Found to have elevated BNP.  Also
   with pulmonary edema on bronch from [**11-2**].
   -          Gently diurese
   All other issues per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter pneumonia, as well as VRE bacteremia/sepsis. He also has left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient requires nightly ventilator assistance for anxiety, tachypnea, and diaphoresis. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia, worsening bilateral pleural effusions, and significant abdominal distention. He is also complicated by profound volume overload and weakness. The patient has been having bloody secretions since November 14th, and a bronchoscopic evaluation of the airway (bronch) has been deferred due to stable respiratory status and likely scope/suctioning trauma given anticoagulation.

The patient's blood cultures have grown VRE, which may explain the fever/hypotension on November 14th. He is afebrile for a few days with stable chest X-ray. The source of infection is unclear, as the PICC line is new on the 25th and there is no evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI). There is suspicion of a new pneumonia given the progression of chest X-ray over the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including bacteremia/sepsis with VRE, pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, left upper and right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, profound volume overload, weakness, and anemia. He also has ileus, hypernatremia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure if the current condition does not improve.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter. This infection needs to be treated appropriately to prevent further complications.
3. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia/sepsis with VRE. It is important to continue treatment with daptomycin for VRE and monitor for any signs of septic shock or worsening infection.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has left upper and right lower extremity DVT. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued to prevent clot propagation and pulmonary embolism.

   I saw, examined the patient and was physically present with the
   pulmonary fellow/resident for discussion of the history and clinical
   treatment plan.
   Today-
   Patient has completed course of ABX for VAP
   Daptomycin continued for treatment of bacteremia with VRE
   Patient has continued treatment with Lovenox for known DVT
   Patient now has continued ventilatory requirement for continued
   support
now continuous
   EXAM-
   CXR-Significant increase in left sided effusion, modest worsening of
   bilateral infiltrates but most impressive for left sided effusions
   A/P-75 yo with prolonged hospital course and now with increasing
   requirement for ventilatory support.  This is in the setting of
   increased positive fluid balance over the past 48 hours and concern is
   for pulmonary edema.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Trach support to continue
   -Move to diuresis if possible
   -Will lead to a pattern of nocturnal ventilatory support over
   intermediate term
   2)Sepsis-
   -Bactermia with VRE noted and continued on Daptomycin
   -Appreciate support from ID consult team and would agree to continue
   with antibiotics
   3)GI Bleed/DVT-
   -Patient with known DVT in RLE
found 7 days ago and LUE found yesterday
   on U/S
   -Maintained on Lovenox, but,
   -Patient with HCT decreased and with fluid responsive hypotension noted

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and previous respiratory failure. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement, and is currently on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, as well as bacteremia with Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). The patient is also experiencing left upper and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's condition is complicated by profound volume overload, weakness, and anemia. He has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with coffee grounds, and is currently showing signs of hemoptysis. 

The patient's electrolyte levels are imbalanced, with hypernatremia and hypokalemia. He is also experiencing oliguria and acute kidney injury, likely due to prerenal causes. 

The patient has a history of ileus since October 30th, which has now resolved. He is tolerating tube feeds at goal with Reglan for promotility.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure requiring increased ventilatory support, persistent bacteremia with VRE"

   ESBL Klebsiella and Acineotbacter pna on [**Last Name (un) **]/Cefepime, VRE
   bacteremia/sepsis on daptomycin, and LUE/RLE DVT on enox. Requires
   nightly vent assistance for anxiety/tachypnea/diaphoresis.
   > Respiratory failure - Pna (ESBL klebsiella and acinetobacter),
   worsening b/l pleural effusions that have reaccumlated following
   thoracentesis, and significant of abdominal distention.   Not treating
   MDR acinetobacter or stenotrophomonas. Effusion was tapped for 1.2 L on
   [**11-13**] and was transudative. He is also complicated by profound volume
   overload and weakness (exacerbated by over all deconditioning,
   prolonged MICU stay and courses of steroids).  Of note, patient has
   been having very bloody secretions since [**11-14**]
 bronch deferred given
   stable from a respiratory standpoint and likely scope/suctioning trauma
   given anticoagulation.  Now requiring ventilator support, likely due to
   increased volume, capillary leak from low level sepsis and possible
   aspiration given cuff leak.  A new PNA as source of VRE is possible as
   well.
   -          Trach collar mask and intermittent vent support as needed.
   -          CXR
   -          Completed 14 day course of Cefepime/[**Last Name (un) **] today
   -          Diuresis as tolerated
    > Bacteremia/Sepsis: VRE growing out of blood from [**11-15**] that may
   explain fever/hypotension from [**11-14**].  Now afebrile for a few days with
   stable CXR. Will need to f/u sputum, blood and urine clx and add
   daptomycin for now.  Unclear source as PICC line is new on 25^th and no
   evidence of UTI. [**Month (only) 60**] be from new PNA given progression of CXR over past
   few days.  His skin exam is actually improved since [**10-27**]. The
   thoracentesis on [**11-13**] has been unrevealing in terms of empyema as it
   appears to be most consistent with a transudative effusion with benign
   pH. ID does not feel that patient needs coverage for MDR
   acinetobacter/stenotrophomonas ([**11-12**]) at this time.  Have completed 14
   day course of cefepime/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for VAP based on [**11-3**] cultures.
   -          F/U blood (picc vs peripheral), urine, sputum and c.diff
   -          Continue dapto for VRE
   -          Decrease hydrocortisone 25mg IV
   -          ID said to add colistin if worsens
   > Oliguria/ARF: Likely prerenal, but in the setting of massive
   anasarca.  Now making decent urine.
   -          Check bladder pressure
   -          Gently diurese
   >Hypernatremia: Now slightly worse.
   - Increase FWF.
   >  Ileus.  Patient had ileus since [**10-30**] that has now resolved with NGT
   suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids.  Tolerating tube feeds
   at goal with reglan for promotility
   -          bowel regimen
   -          ultram only at low dose with turns, caution with opioids,
   cont reglan
    >  Anemia:  H/o UGIB/coffee grounds.  Noted to have coffee grounds in
   NG suctioning on [**11-3**], likely secondary to prolonged NG suctioning.
   Now with decreased hct of unclear source, but having hemoptysis. S/p 1
   unit PRBC with downtrending Hct with another unit today.   Possible
   that he is just oozing from various sources given anticoagulation.
   -          Serial Hcts
   -          Po ppi
   -          hold aspirin, plavix; consider resuming aspirin in future if
   hct/ bleed remains stable

   > LUE/RLE DVT.  Anticoagulation with heparin started on [**11-8**].
   Transitioned to lovenox on [**11-9**].
   -          continue lovenox at low dose, 60mg [**Hospital1 **], based on dry weight
   (concern for bleeding)
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] need to hold if Hct drops significantly

   -          further management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient recovers from
   this hospitalization.
   -          hold asa/plavix given above, consider resuming aspirin when
   NGT is removed and hct stable
   -          hold opioids due to ileus
   > HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC
 hold on diuresis given hypotension,

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for various complications including pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella and Acinetobacter, VRE bacteremia/sepsis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), profound volume overload, weakness, and ileus. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is dependent on nighttime ventilator assistance due to anxiety, tachypnea, and diaphoresis. He has had bloody secretions since November 14th, which may be due to bronchoscopic trauma or aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation due to worsening bilateral pleural effusions and respiratory distress. There is a concern for increased volume, capillary leak from low-level sepsis, possible aspiration given cuff leak, and a new pneumonia as a source of VRE.
2. Bacteremia/Sepsis: The patient has VRE growing out of blood cultures from November 15th, which may explain the fever and hypotension on November 14th. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be a new pneumonia or the prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has LUE/RLE DVT and is currently on enoxaparin (lovenox) for anticoagulation.
4. Anemia: The patient has a decreasing hemoglobin level, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB/coffee grounds) and hemoptysis. He has received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and will need further transfusions to maintain his target hemoglobin level.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is slightly worse, and he needs increased fluid restriction and fluid warming.
6. Ileus: The patient had an ileus since October 30th, which has now resolved with NGT suctioning, bowel rest, and minimizing opioids. He is tolerating tube feeds at goal with reglan for motility.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and his heart rate is in the 100s. He is getting anticoagulated with lovenox.
8. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has PVD and is awaiting revascularization after discharge. He has stable left lower extremity dry gangrene.
9. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic: The patient has diastolic heart failure with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pulmonary edema on bronchoscopy from November 2nd. He should be gently diuresed.
10. Potential complications related to anticoagulation, such as bleeding, should also be closely monitored."

   75 year old man with CAD, PVD and chronic nonhealing ulcers, with a
   complicated hospitalization most notable for recurrent
   ventilator-associated pneumonias, now with persistent respiratory
   failure possibly from a new right lung VAP
   1.  Respiratory failure from multiple VAPs and worsening volume
   overload
   -   Completed meropenem/cefepime course so will d/c antibiotics
   -  Lasix 40 mg IV then drip for diuresis
   -   Vent support as needed
   -   Continue MDIs
   2.   VRE bacteremia: unclear source
   -    cont daptomycin; if cultures remain positive, will need to change
   PICC
   -    Serial blood cultures
   3.  Hypotension; BP stable for several days now
   -     off stress dose steroids
   -     consider resuming beta blockers if BP remains stable
   4. Hypernatremia:
   -   Increase free water boluses to 250cc q4h
   5.  Anemia; getting 1 unit pRBCs now
   -    Guaiac stools
   -    Trend HCT, transfuse HCT <25
   -    Consider bronchoscopy with recent blood around trach. [**Month (only) 60**] be from
   suctioning.
   6.   LUE DVT; likely from recent left PICC
   -     cont enoxaparin but hold warfarin given the likelihood of him
   needing an additional invasive procedure
   7.   Atrial fibrillation
   -     hold beta blockade and warfarin as above; cont enoxaparin
   8.   Ileus; resolving
   -     cont metoclopramide and follow abdominal exam; minimize opiods;
   bladder pressure 9
   9.   PVD
   -      cont current analgesia regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of CAD, PVD, and chronic nonhealing ulcers.
- He has had a complicated hospitalization with recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs).
- Currently, he is experiencing persistent respiratory failure possibly from a new right lung VAP.
- The patient has a VRE bacteremia with an unclear source.
- His blood pressure has been stable for several days, but he is still hypotensive.
- He has hypernatremia and anemia.
- The patient also has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- He is in atrial fibrillation and has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
- There is evidence of an ileus, which is resolving.
- The patient's condition requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially require more aggressive ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. VRE Bacteremia: The presence of VRE bacteremia increases the risk of systemic infection and sepsis. It is important to monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and consider source control measures if necessary.
3. Hypotension: Despite being stable for several days, the patient's hypotension should be closely monitored. If it worsens, it may indicate"

   75 year old man with CAD, PVD and chronic nonhealing ulcers, with a
   complicated hospitalization most notable for recurrent
   ventilator-associated pneumonias, now with persistent respiratory
   failure possibly from a new right lung VAP
   After the vitals and lab data shown on this sheet for the am, but
   before this note was finalized, Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 6778**] appeared to have an acute
   decompensation in which his blood pressure began dropping into the 90s
   (from 120s sbp) and then to the 70s. At the same time he was found to
   be febrile to 101.4 axillary. Keeping in mind that we had recently
   discontinued antibiotics we restarted cefepime and meropenem.
   Additionally he received 2 transfusions PRBCs today; the second was
   mostly completed when he was found to be febrile, and was stopped then.
   When his pressures stayed consistently in the 70s we began bolusing
   him, although his access was limited to a PICC line so this was at a
   rate of approx 700-750 cc/hr. His pressures continued to drop and he
   went from being tachycardic in the 110s-120s to converting to sinus
   rhythm and then to sinus brady. His pressures continued to drop. We
   began running Levophed and then as he began to be bradycardic, started
   dopamine. Ultimately his heart rate began slowing into the 30s and he
   lost his pulse and gained an increasingly mottled appearance despite
   the dopamine and Levophed. He ultimately had sustained asystole and was
   declared dead at 2:14 PM.
   Possible causes include a pulmonary embolism or cardiogenic shock
   secondary to MI, though no ST changes were seen on telemetry to verify
   the second; infection could be a cause though the acuity of the changes
   (over approximately 1.5-2.5 hours) would be unusual; transfusion
   reaction is unlikely given that he was not particularly hypoxemic as he
   began the other changes. Infection leading to demand leading to MI
   might be another reasonable course.
   We will continue to try to contact Mr [**Name (NI) 5700**]
s wife.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic nonhealing ulcers. He was admitted to the ICU with recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonias and now presents with persistent respiratory failure possibly due to a new right lung ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's recent events include completing meropenem/cefepime, discontinuing Flagyl due to negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxins, receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) followed by a Lasix bolus and drip, experiencing a heart rate of 120s-130s in atrial fibrillation (afib) with stable blood pressures, and restarting metoprolol.

The patient's lab results show hypernatremia (high sodium), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in both upper and lower extremities, small bowel obstruction (SBO), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, anemia, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation (afib), impaired skin integrity, hyperkalemia (high potassium), pleural effusion, and acute PVD without critical limb ischemia.

The patient's vitals and lab data indicate a decline in his condition. Despite being febrile and having low blood pressure, the patient was found unresponsive and eventually declared dead"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress and potential medical complications:

1. The patient has completed meropenem/cefepime and discontinued Flagyl due to negative C. Diff toxins.
2. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) in the morning followed by a Lasix bolus (40 mg IV) and Lasix drip. The patient's heart rate remained high at 120s-130s with stable blood pressures, so metoprolol was resumed.
3. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been drifting down despite the transfusion, with a current level of 22.4%. Additional 2 units of pRBCs were ordered, as the patient has guaiac positive stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. The patient has allergies to vancomycin, Linezolid, and thrombocytopenia.
5. The patient's antibiotic regimen includes cefepime, meropenem, and daptomycin, with the last doses administered on 11/18/2125.
6. The patient is currently on furosemide (Lasix) infusion at 1 mg/hour.
7. The patient is also receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) since 11/19/2125 02:00 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia (high sodium), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia, anemia due to ongoing gastrointestinal losses, chronic respiratory failure with recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, confusion, seizures, and neurological complications if not managed properly.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of a DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.
3. Anemia: The ongoing gastrointestinal losses have resulted in anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure puts him at risk for further respiratory complications, including worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
5. Recurrent Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has had recurrent episodes of VAP, which can be caused by various factors such as aspiration, colonization of the endotracheal tube, or inadequate lung clearance.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The"
