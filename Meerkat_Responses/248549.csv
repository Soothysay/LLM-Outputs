   Assessment and Plan
   73 y.o. male with known CAD, AF, DM, and pericarditis / pericardial
   effusions who presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with
   recent NSTEMI.
   1) [**Last Name (un) 12772**]
s Pericarditis/Pericardial effusion:  This is patient's
   third episode of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology.  Patient
   also has large left sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology.  Would
   not be unreasonable to check ESR, CRP, [**Doctor First Name **], place PPD to rule out most
   common causes of pericardial effusion (collagen vascular disease
   particularly given pericardial effusion, TB) as viral seems less likely
   given recurrent episodes.  Previous tap negative for malignant cells
   though bloody fluid is somewhat concerning.  Distant mediastinal
   radiation can also cause recurrent effusions and this is possible from
   patient's previous SCLC treatment & known history of radiation
   overdose.
   -Consider [**Doctor First Name **], ESR, CRP, PPD in consultation with primary cardiologist
   -Recheck ECHO today
   -F/U fluid cytology
   -Pericardial drain care per protocol
   -Ibuprofen PRN pain
   2) Likely NSTEMI: Patient has elevated troponins and likely recent
   NSTEMI.  He has known LCx disease that has not yet been reopened and
   plan is to do this later in the week after effusion is no longer
   draining sanguinous fluid.  For the moment cardiac enzymes are falling,
   but in the context of nausea & diaphoresis this AM, another set of CE
   sent. EKG
s stable this AM.
   -Monitor closely for signs of cardiac ischemia
   -Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, BB, statin
   -F/U CE
s this AM
   -Hold heparin for now given bloody pericardial fluid
   - NPO after MN for cardiac catheterization
   3) Pump: Despite relatively severe and early onset CAD this patient has
   a normal LVEF and no history of clinical heart failure.  Patient had
   signs of early diastolic invagination but no tamponade physiology and
   no hemodynamic disruption on preprocedure echocardiograms.  Currently,
   pericardium is decompressed.
   -Continue ASA, BB, ACEi
   -Monitor
   4) Rhythm: Patient is in and out of AF and not optimally rate
   controlled.  He is not on Coumadin due to a recent subdural hematoma.
   -Continue Metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, continue Diltiazem ER 120mg daily
   -Continue ASA, hold coumadin or other anticoagulation for moment
   5) DM: Continue insulin sliding scale.
   6) Anemia: Stable and presumed due to thalassemia minor

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. He presents to the cardiac care unit (CCU) after balloon pericardiotomy and with a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's third episode of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology is ongoing, along with a large left-sided pleural effusion. He also has known LCx disease that has not yet been reopened.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pericarditis/Pericardial effusion: Check ESR, CRP, PPD to rule out most common causes of pericardial effusion (collagen vascular disease particularly given pericardial effusion, TB) as viral seems less likely given recurrent episodes. Previous tap negative for malignant cells, though bloody fluid is somewhat concerning. Distant mediastinal radiation can also cause recurrent effusions and this is possible from patient's previous small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treatment & known history of radiation overdose.

   73 y.o. male with known CAD, AF, DM, and pericarditis / pericardial
   effusions who presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with
   recent NSTEMI.
   .
   1) Pleuro-pericardial effusion:  This is patient's third episode of
   pericardial effusion of unclear etiology.  Patient also has large left
   sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology.  Previous tap negative for
   malignant cells though bloody fluid is concerning for malignancy.
   Distant mediastinal radiation can also cause recurrent effusions and
   this is possible from patient's previous SCLC treatment & known history
   of radiation overdose.  Also, it would not be unreasonable to check
   ESR, CRP, [**Doctor First Name **], place PPD to rule out most common causes of pericardial
   effusion (collagen vascular disease particularly given pericardial
   effusion, TB) as viral seems less likely given recurrent episodes.  TTE
   on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect
   evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.  Pericardial drain pulled
   on [**1-19**].
   -F/U fluid cytology
   -continue standing indomethacin and prn morphine for pain
   -Consider [**Doctor First Name **], ESR, CRP, PPD in consultation with primary cardiologist
   -monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   -if concerning for enlarged pericardial effusion, will check pulsus and
   get stat TTE
   .
   2) Likely NSTEMI: Patient had elevated CEs and likely recent NSTEMI.
   CEs are currently trending down. His coronary angiography revealed a
   patent LAD stent but an occluded circumflex, which was not intervented
   on due to desire to avoid need for further anticoagulation in the
   setting of recent drainage of hemorrhagic effusion.  Now that patient
   pericardial output significantly decreased and drain pulled, plan is
   for cath today.
   -Cardiac cath today
   -Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, BB, statin
   -monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   -Monitor closely for signs of cardiac ischemia
   .
   3) Pump: Despite relatively severe and early onset CAD this patient has
   a normal LVEF and no history of clinical heart failure.  Patient had
   signs of early diastolic invagination but no tamponade physiology and
   no hemodynamic disruption on preprocedure echocardiograms.  Repeat TTE
   on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect
   evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.
   -Continue ASA, BB, ACEi
   .
   4) Rhythm: Patient is in and out of AF and not optimally rate
   controlled.  He is not on Coumadin due to a recent subdural hematoma.
   -Continue Metoprolol 50 mg PO TID, continue Diltiazem ER 120mg daily
   -Continue ASA, hold coumadin or other anticoagulation for moment

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. The patient presented to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and had a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Pleuro-pericardial effusion: The patient has had three episodes of pericardial effusion, with the most recent one showing minimal fluid reaccumulation and indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology. There is also a large left-sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology. Previous taps were negative for malignant cells, but the fluid was bloody, raising concern for malignancy. Possible causes include distant mediastinal radiation, which can cause recurrent effusions, as well as collagen vascular disease, particularly given the pericardial effusion.

2. NSTEMI: The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes (CEs) and likely experienced a recent NSTEMI. His coronary angiography revealed a patent left anterior descending (LAD) stent but an occluded circumflex artery, which was not intervened upon due to concerns about further anticoagulation in the setting of recent drainage of a hemorrhagic effusion. The plan is for a cardiac catheterization"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. He presents to the critical care unit (CCU) after undergoing balloon pericardiotomy and experiencing a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current condition shows minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/62 mmHg to 117/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%.

The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, clear lungs, and no murmurs. His extremities are warm and well-perfused, and there is no evidence of edema. Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented, with mild hearing loss but intact cranial nerves and movement of all extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct), as well as slightly elevated potassium levels (K+) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y.o. male with known CAD, AF, DM, and pericarditis / pericardial
   effusions who presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with
   recent NSTEMI.
   .
   1) Pleuro-pericardial effusion:  This is patient's third episode of
   pericardial effusion of unclear etiology.  Patient also has large left
   sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology.  Previous tap negative for
   malignant cells though bloody fluid is concerning for malignancy.
   Another possibility is that the pacemaker has caused micro-perforation
   in ventricle since pleural effusion and tamponade physiology were not
   present prior to pacemaker placement.  Distant mediastinal radiation
   can also cause recurrent effusions and this is possible from patient's
   previous SCLC treatment & known history of radiation overdose.  Also,
   it would not be unreasonable to check ESR, CRP, [**Doctor First Name **], place PPD to rule
   out most common causes of pericardial effusion (collagen vascular
   disease particularly given pericardial effusion, TB) as viral seems
   less likely given recurrent episodes.  TTE on [**1-19**] showed minimal
   pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect evidence of
   effusive-constrictive physiology.  Pericardial drain pulled on [**1-19**].

   will receive heparin during the procedure
   -if concerning for enlarged pericardial effusion, will check pulsus and
   get stat TTE

   2) Likely NSTEMI: Patient had elevated CEs and likely recent NSTEMI.
   CEs are currently trending down. His coronary angiography revealed a
   patent LAD stent but an occluded circumflex, which was not intervented
   on due to desire to avoid need for further anticoagulation in the
   setting of recent drainage of hemorrhagic effusion.  Now that patient
   pericardial output significantly decreased and drain pulled, plan is
   for cath today.

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. He presented to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and recent NSTEMI. 

The patient has had three episodes of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology. He also has a large left-sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology. Previous taps were negative for malignant cells, but the fluid was bloody and concerning for malignancy. Another possibility is that the pacemaker has caused micro-perforation in the ventricle since pleural effusion and tamponade physiology were not present prior to pacemaker placement. Distant mediastinal radiation can also cause recurrent effusions, which is possible given the patient's previous small cell lung cancer treatment and known history of radiation overdose. 

The patient's TTE on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology. The pericardial drain was pulled on [**1-19**]. 

The plan is to tap the pleural effusion today, interrogate the pacemaker today, follow up with fluid cytology, continue standing indomethacin and prn morphine for pain, consider [**Doctor First Name**], ESR, CRP, PPD in consultation with the primary cardiologist, and monitor per"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y.o. male with known CAD, AF, DM, and pericarditis / pericardial
   effusions who presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with
   recent NSTEMI.
   .
   1) Pleuro-pericardial effusion:  This is patient's third episode of
   pericardial effusion of unclear etiology.  Patient also has large left
   sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology for the first time noted
   during this admission.  Pericardial tap negative for malignant cells
   x2.  Patient underwent thoracentesis Pleural fluid is transudative.  We
   also considered the possibility of the pacemaker wire causing
   micro-perforation in ventricle since pleural effusion and tamponade
   physiology were not present prior to pacemaker placement. However,
   pacemaker interogation showed the pacer is working well. Distant
   mediastinal radiation can also cause recurrent effusions and this is
   possible from patient's previous SCLC treatment & known history of
   radiation overdose.  Collagen vascular disease should be ruled out as
   well.  TTE on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with
   indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.  Pericardial
   drain pulled on [**1-19**].
   - F/U pleural fluid cytology
   - continue standing indomethacin and prn morphine for pain
   - f/u on [**Doctor First Name **], ESR, CRP
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - if concerning for enlarged pericardial effusion, will check pulsus
   and get bedside TTE
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient had elevated CEs and likely recent NSTEMI.  He then
   had nausea and diaphoresis overnight last night with EKG finding of ST
   depression in V1-V5 in the setting of afib with RVR. The ST depression
   in anterolateral leads is concerning for LAD lesion, but could also be
   rate-related demand ischemia. Sx resolved after SL nitro and
   rate-control for Afib. His coronary angiography on [**1-18**] revealed a
   patent LAD stent but an occluded circumflex, which was not intervented
   on due to desire to avoid need for further anticoagulation in the
   setting of recent drainage of hemorrhagic effusion.  Now that patient
   pericardial output significantly decreased and drain pulled, plan is to
   cath him some time next week.
   - Cardiac cath next week
   - Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, BB, statin
   - hold off on heparin given recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion
   - SL nitro prn, will start nitro gtt if persistently symptomatic
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - Monitor closely for signs of cardiac ischemia
   .
   3) Pump: Despite relatively severe and early onset CAD this patient has
   a normal LVEF and no history of clinical heart failure.  Patient had
   signs of early diastolic invagination but no tamponade physiology and
   no hemodynamic disruption on preprocedure echocardiograms.  Repeat TTE
   on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect
   evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.
   - Continue BB, ACEi
   .
   4) Rhythm: Patient is in and out of AF and not optimally rate
   controlled.  He is not on Coumadin due to a recent subdural hematoma.
   - Continue Metoprolol 50 mg PO TID
   - continue Diltiazem ER 120mg daily
   - Continue ASA, hold coumadin or other anticoagulation for moment
   .
   5) DM:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   6) Anemia: Stable and presumed due to thalassemia minor
   - Daily Hct
   .
   7) Hyperthyroidism:
   - Continue Methimazole at 2.5mg daily

   had nausea and diaphoresis overnight last night with EKG finding of ST
   depression in V1-V5 in the setting of afib with RVR. The ST depression
   in anterolateral leads is concerning for LAD lesion, but could also be
   rate-related demand ischemia. Sx resolved after SL nitro and
   rate-control for Afib. His coronary angiography on [**1-18**] revealed a
   patent LAD stent but an occluded circumflex, which was not intervented
   on due to desire to avoid need for further anticoagulation in the
   setting of recent drainage of hemorrhagic effusion.  Now that patient
   pericardial output significantly decreased and drain pulled, plan is to
   cath him some time next week.
   - Cardiac cath on Monday
   - Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, BB, statin
   - will start heparin gtt if pt has anginal sx again today
   (nausea+diaphoresis+?chest pain), need to differentiate chest pain due
   to pericardial effusion from anginal chest pain
   - re-program pacer to DDI by EP today
   - SL nitro prn, will start nitro gtt if persistently symptomatic
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - Monitor closely for signs of cardiac ischemia
   .
   3) Pump: Despite relatively severe and early onset CAD this patient has
   a normal LVEF and no history of clinical heart failure.  Patient had
   signs of early diastolic invagination but no tamponade physiology and
   no hemodynamic disruption on preprocedure echocardiograms.  Repeat TTE
   on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect
   evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.
   - Continue BB, ACEi
   - give lasix 20mg IV today for net 0.5L negative
   .
   4) Rhythm: Patient is in and out of AF and not optimally rate
   controlled.  He is not on Coumadin due to a recent subdural hematoma.
   - Continue Metoprolol 50 mg PO TID
   - continue Diltiazem ER 120mg daily
   - can give 5mg IV metoprolol for Afib with RVR to rate-control
   - Continue ASA, hold coumadin
   .
   5) DM:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   6) Anemia: Stable and presumed due to thalassemia minor
   - Daily Hct
   .
   7) Hyperthyroidism:
   - Continue Methimazole at 2.5mg daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with known coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. He presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has had three episodes of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology. He also has a large left-sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology for the first time noted during this admission. The pleural fluid is non-bloody and transudative in nature. 

Assessment and Plan:
1) Pleuro-pericardial effusion: The patient's third episode of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology. Repeat TTE to see if pericardial window remains open. Give Lasix 20mg IV today for net 0.5L negative. F/U pleural fluid cytology. Continue standing indomethacin and prn dilaudid or percocet for pain. F/U on [Doctor First Name], ESR, CRP. Monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion symptoms and hct after cath as pt will receive heparin during the procedure. If concerning for enlarged pericardial effusion, will check pulsus and get bedside TTE.

2) NSTEMI: The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y.o. male with known CAD, AF, DM, and pericarditis / pericardial
   effusions who presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with
   recent NSTEMI.
   .
   1) Pleuro-pericardial effusion:  This is patient's third episode of
   pericardial effusion of unclear etiology.  Patient also has large left
   sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology for the first time noted
   during this admission.  Pericardial tap negative for malignant cells
   x2.  Patient underwent thoracentesis on [**1-20**].8L removed.  Pleural
   fluid non-bloody, transudative in nature based on LDH, albumin and
   cholesterol criteria.  meets the protein criteria for exudative fluid,
   but this criteria is less specific than the other criteria and leads to
   many false positive results. We also considered the possibility of the
   pacemaker wire causing micro-perforation in ventricle since pleural
   effusion and tamponade physiology were not present prior to pacemaker
   placement. However, pacemaker interogation showed the pacer is working
   well. Distant mediastinal radiation can also cause recurrent effusions
   and this is possible from patient's previous SCLC treatment & known
   history of radiation overdose.  Collagen vascular disease should be
   ruled out as well.  TTE on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid
   reaccumulation with indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive
   physiology.  Pericardial drain pulled on [**1-19**].
   - F/U pleural fluid cytology
   - continue standing indomethacin and prn dilaudid or percocet for pain
   - f/u on [**Doctor First Name **], ESR, CRP
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - if concerning for enlarged pericardial effusion, will check pulsus
   and get bedside TTE

   2) NSTEMI: Patient had elevated CEs and likely recent NSTEMI.  He then
   had nausea and diaphoresis overnight last night with EKG finding of ST
   depression in V1-V5 in the setting of afib with RVR. The ST depression
   in anterolateral leads is concerning for LAD lesion, but could also be

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y.o. male with known CAD, AF, DM, and pericarditis / pericardial
   effusions who presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with
   recent NSTEMI.
   .
   1) Pleuro-pericardial effusion:  This is patient's third episode of
   pericardial effusion of unclear etiology.  Patient also has large left
   sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology for the first time noted
   during this admission.  Pericardial tap negative for malignant cells
   x2.  Patient underwent thoracentesis on [**1-20**].8L removed.  Pleural
   fluid non-bloody, transudative in nature based on LDH, albumin and
   cholesterol criteria.  meets the protein criteria for exudative fluid,
   but this criteria is less specific than the other criteria and leads to
   many false positive results. We also considered the possibility of the
   pacemaker wire causing micro-perforation in ventricle since pleural
   effusion and tamponade physiology were not present prior to pacemaker
   placement. However, pacemaker interogation showed the pacer is working
   well. Distant mediastinal radiation can also cause recurrent effusions
   and this is possible from patient's previous SCLC treatment & known
   history of radiation overdose.  Collagen vascular disease should be
   ruled out as well.  TTE on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid
   reaccumulation with indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive
   physiology.  Pericardial drain pulled on [**1-19**].
   - F/U pleural fluid cytology
   - continue standing indomethacin and prn dilaudid or percocet for pain
   - f/u on [**Doctor First Name **], ESR, CRP
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - if concerning for enlarged pericardial effusion, will check pulsus
   and get bedside TTE
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient had elevated CEs and likely recent NSTEMI.  He then
   had nausea and diaphoresis overnight last night with EKG finding of ST
   depression in V1-V5 in the setting of afib with RVR. The ST depression
   in anterolateral leads is concerning for LAD lesion, but could also be
   rate-related demand ischemia. Sx resolved after SL nitro and
   rate-control for Afib. His coronary angiography on [**1-18**] revealed a
   patent LAD stent but an occluded circumflex, which was not intervented
   on due to desire to avoid need for further anticoagulation in the
   setting of recent drainage of hemorrhagic effusion.  Now that patient
   pericardial output significantly decreased and drain pulled, plan is to
   cath him some time next week.
   - Cardiac cath next week
   - Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, BB, statin
   - hold off on heparin given recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion
   - SL nitro prn, will start nitro gtt if persistently symptomatic
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - Monitor closely for signs of cardiac ischemia
   .
   3) Pump: Despite relatively severe and early onset CAD this patient has
   a normal LVEF and no history of clinical heart failure.  Patient had
   signs of early diastolic invagination but no tamponade physiology and
   no hemodynamic disruption on preprocedure echocardiograms.  Repeat TTE
   on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect
   evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.
   - Continue BB, ACEi
   .
   4) Rhythm: Patient is in and out of AF and not optimally rate
   controlled.  He is not on Coumadin due to a recent subdural hematoma.
   - Continue Metoprolol 50 mg PO TID
   - continue Diltiazem ER 120mg daily
   - Continue ASA, hold coumadin or other anticoagulation for moment
   .
   5) DM:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   6) Anemia: Stable and presumed due to thalassemia minor
   - Daily Hct
   .
   7) Hyperthyroidism:
   - Continue Methimazole at 2.5mg daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with known coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pericarditis/pericardial effusions.
- He presented to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient has had three episodes of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology, and a large left-sided pleural effusion was noted during this admission.
- Thoracentesis was performed, removing 1.8 liters of pleural fluid that is non-bloody and transudative in nature.
- The patient experienced pleuritic chest pain after a procedure, which was likely associated with pleurisy from the catheter.
- An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and ST depressions in V1-V5, suggesting possible ischemia.
- The patient received sublingual nitro and metoprolol for rate control, resulting in significant improvement of symptoms.
- Coronary angiography revealed a patent left anterior descending (LAD) stent but an occluded circumflex artery, which was not intervened upon due to the desire to avoid further anticoagulation.
- The patient's pericardial output has significantly decreased, and the drain was pulled.
- The plan is to perform cardiac catheterization next week.
- The patient will continue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with known coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. He presented to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's pleural effusion is transudative in nature, and the pericardial effusion appears to be mainly pleural effusion. There is indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.

The plan is to catheterize him next week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleuro-pericardial effusion: The patient has had multiple episodes of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology. The large left-sided pleural effusion could be due to various causes such as pacemaker wire-related micro-perforation, distant mediastinal radiation, collagen vascular disease, or pericardial constriction.
2. NSTEMI: The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes and likely recent NSTEMI. He experienced nausea and diaphoresis with EKG findings of ST depression in V1-V5 leads. The ST depression could be due to a LAD lesion or rate-related demand ischemia.

   The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. The
   right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Biventricular systolic
   function appears grossly preserved in focused views. There is abnormal
   septal motion suggestive of possible pericardial constriction. The
   aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a very
   small pericardial effusion. The pericardium appears thickened.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2102-1-19**], the
   pericardial effusion appears smaller. The fluid apical to the left
   ventricle now appears to consist largely of pleural effusion, although
   views are limited.
   Assessment and Plan
   73 y.o. male with known CAD, AF, DM, and pericarditis / pericardial
   effusions who presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with
   recent NSTEMI.
   .
   1) Pleuro-pericardial effusion:  This is patient's third episode of
   pericardial effusion of unclear etiology.  Patient also has large left
   sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology for the first time noted
   during this admission.  Pericardial tap negative for malignant cells
   x2.  Patient underwent thoracentesis on [**1-20**].8L removed.  Pleural
   fluid non-bloody, transudative in nature based on LDH, albumin and
   cholesterol criteria.  meets the protein criteria for exudative fluid,
   but this criteria is less specific than the other criteria and leads to
   many false positive results. We also considered the possibility of the
   pacemaker wire causing micro-perforation in ventricle since pleural
   effusion and tamponade physiology were not present prior to pacemaker
   placement. However, pacemaker interogation showed the pacer is working
   well. Distant mediastinal radiation can also cause recurrent effusions
   and this is possible from patient's previous SCLC treatment & known
   history of radiation overdose.  Collagen vascular disease should be
   ruled out as well.  TTE on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid
   reaccumulation with indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive
   physiology.  Pericardial drain pulled on [**1-19**]. TTE on [**1-21**] showed
   pericardial thickening and fluid appears to be mainly pleural effusion.
   CRP is markedly elevated on [**1-21**], [**Doctor First Name **] pending
   - pain control: continue standing indomethacin and prn dilaudid or
   percocet for pain
   - F/U pleural fluid cytology
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - if concerning for enlarged pericardial effusion, will check pulsus
   and get bedside TTE
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient had elevated CEs and likely recent NSTEMI.  He then
   had nausea and diaphoresis [**1-20**] with EKG finding of ST depression in
   V1-V5 in the setting of afib with RVR. The ST depression in
   anterolateral leads is concerning for LAD lesion, but could also be
   rate-related demand ischemia. Sx resolved after SL nitro and
   rate-control for Afib. His coronary angiography on [**1-18**] revealed a
   patent LAD stent but an occluded circumflex, which was not intervented
   on due to desire to avoid need for further anticoagulation in the
   setting of recent drainage of hemorrhagic effusion.  Now that patient
   pericardial output significantly decreased and drain pulled, plan is to
   cath him some time next week.
   - Cardiac cath on Monday
   - Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, BB, statin
   - will start heparin gtt if pt has anginal sx again today
   (nausea+diaphoresis+?chest pain), need to differentiate chest pain due
   to pericardial effusion from anginal chest pain
   - re-program pacer to DDI by EP today
   - SL nitro prn, will start nitro gtt if persistently symptomatic
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - Monitor closely for signs of cardiac ischemia
   .
   3) Pump: Despite relatively severe and early onset CAD this patient has
   a normal LVEF and no history of clinical heart failure.  Patient had
   signs of early diastolic invagination but no tamponade physiology and
   no hemodynamic disruption on preprocedure echocardiograms.  Repeat TTE
   on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect
   evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.
   - Continue BB, ACEi
   - maintain negative or equal fluid balance
   .
   4) Rhythm: Patient is in and out of AF and not optimally rate
   controlled.  He is not on Coumadin due to a recent subdural hematoma.
   - Continue Metoprolol 50 mg PO TID
   - continue Diltiazem ER 120mg daily
   - can give 5mg IV metoprolol for Afib with RVR to rate-control
   - Continue ASA, hold coumadin
   .
   5) DM:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   6) Anemia: Stable and presumed due to thalassemia minor
   - Daily Hct
   .
   7) Hyperthyroidism:
   - Continue Methimazole at 2.5mg daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with known coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. He presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and recent NSTEMI. The patient has had multiple episodes of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology. The most recent episode shows a very small pericardial effusion, and the prior TTE on [**2102-1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology. The patient underwent thoracentesis on [**1-20**], removing 8L of pleural fluid. The pleural fluid is non-bloody, transudative in nature, but meets the protein criteria for exudative fluid. The patient also has large left-sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology for the first time noted during this admission. The patient's CRP is markedly elevated on [**2102-1-21**], with pending results for ESR and cardiac enzymes. The patient's current medications include lasix, dilaudid, nitro, heparin, metoprolol, diltiazem, ASA, clopidogrel, and a statin. The patient's plan includes cardiac catheterization on Monday, reprogramming the pacer to DDI by EP today, and monitoring for signs of cardiac ischemia. The patient's overall condition appears to be stable, but with several potential medical complications that need to be closely monitored and managed."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with known coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. He presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has had three episodes of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology, with the most recent episode showing a small pericardial effusion and pleural effusion. The pericardial tap was negative for malignant cells. The patient underwent thoracentesis, removing 8L of pleural fluid, which was transudative in nature. The possibility of pacemaker wire causing micro-perforation in the ventricle is considered, but pacemaker interrogation showed that the pacer is functioning well. Distant mediastinal radiation can also cause recurrent effusions, which is a possibility given the patient's history of radiation overdose. Collagen vascular disease should be ruled out as well. The patient's CRP is markedly elevated, and further evaluation is pending. The patient's pleural fluid cytology will be monitored, and he will be monitored for pericarditis/pericardial effusion symptoms and hematocrit after cardiac catheterization, as he will receive heparin during the procedure.

   73 y.o. male with known CAD, AF, DM, and pericarditis / pericardial
   effusions who presents to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and with
   recent NSTEMI.
   .
   1) Pleuro-pericardial effusion:  This is patient's third episode of
   pericardial effusion of unclear etiology.  Patient also has large left
   sided pleural effusion of unclear etiology for the first time noted
   during this admission.  Pericardial tap negative for malignant cells
   x2.  Patient underwent thoracentesis on [**1-20**].8L removed.  Pleural
   fluid non-bloody, transudative in nature based on LDH, albumin and
   cholesterol criteria.  meets the protein criteria for exudative fluid,
   but this criteria is less specific than the other criteria and leads to
   many false positive results. We also considered the possibility of the
   pacemaker wire causing micro-perforation in ventricle since pleural
   effusion and tamponade physiology were not present prior to pacemaker
   placement. However, pacemaker interogation showed the pacer is working
   well. Distant mediastinal radiation can also cause recurrent effusions
   and this is possible from patient's previous SCLC treatment & known
   history of radiation overdose.  Collagen vascular disease should be
   ruled out as well.  TTE on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid
   reaccumulation with indirect evidence of effusive-constrictive
   physiology.  Pericardial drain pulled on [**1-19**]. TTE on [**1-21**] showed
   pericardial thickening and fluid appears to be mainly pleural effusion.
   CRP is markedly elevated on [**1-21**], [**Doctor First Name **] pending
   - pain control: continue standing indomethacin and colchicine, prn
   dilaudid or percocet for pain
   - F/U pleural fluid cytology
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - if concerning for enlarged pericardial effusion, will check pulsus
   and get bedside TTE
   .
   2) NSTEMI: Patient had elevated CEs and likely recent NSTEMI.  He then
   had nausea and diaphoresis [**1-20**] with EKG finding of ST depression in
   V1-V5 in the setting of afib with RVR. The ST depression in
   anterolateral leads is concerning for LAD lesion, but could also be
   rate-related demand ischemia. Sx resolved after SL nitro and
   rate-control for Afib. His coronary angiography on [**1-18**] revealed a
   patent LAD stent but an occluded circumflex, which was not intervented
   on due to desire to avoid need for further anticoagulation in the
   setting of recent drainage of hemorrhagic effusion.  Now that patient
   pericardial output significantly decreased and drain pulled, plan is to
   cath him some time next week.
   - Cardiac cath today
   - Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, BB, statin
   - will start heparin gtt if pt has anginal sx again
   (nausea+diaphoresis+?chest pain), need to differentiate chest pain due
   to pericardial effusion from anginal chest pain
   - SL nitro prn, will start nitro gtt if persistently symptomatic
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - Monitor closely for signs of cardiac ischemia
   .
   3) Pump: Despite relatively severe and early onset CAD this patient has
   a normal LVEF and no history of clinical heart failure.  Patient had
   signs of early diastolic invagination but no tamponade physiology and
   no hemodynamic disruption on preprocedure echocardiograms.  Repeat TTE
   on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect
   evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.
   - Continue BB, ACEi
   - maintain negative or equal fluid balance
   .
   4) Rhythm: Patient is in and out of AF and not optimally rate
   controlled.  He is not on Coumadin due to a recent subdural hematoma.
   - Continue Metoprolol 50 mg PO TID
   - continue Diltiazem ER 120mg daily
   - can give 5mg IV metoprolol for Afib with RVR to rate-control
   - Continue ASA, hold coumadin
   .
   5) DM:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   6) Anemia: Stable and presumed due to thalassemia minor
   - Daily Hct
   .
   7) Hyperthyroidism:
   - Continue Methimazole at 2.5mg daily
   .
   8) Bowel Disorder: Patient has dependence on bowel regimen that is both
   mechanical and functional.
   - senna, colace, miralax
   - lactulose prn
   - avoid mag citrate

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. He presents to the ICU after balloon pericardiotomy and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has experienced three episodes of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology, with the most recent episode involving a large left-sided pleural effusion. The pleural fluid is transudative in nature. 

The patient's current medical issues include pleuro-pericardial effusion, NSTEMI, and cardiac pump dysfunction. He is being treated with indomethacin and colchicine for pain control, monitoring of pericardial effusion symptoms, and follow-up pleural fluid cytology. The plan is to perform cardiac catheterization next week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleuro-pericardial effusion: The patient's recurrent effusions can potentially lead to tamponade physiology and compromised cardiac output.
2. NSTEMI: The patient may experience recurrent angina or myocardial ischemia, which could progress to another myocardial infarction.
3. Cardiac pump dysfunction: The patient's cardiac function may deteriorate further, leading to heart failure or cardiogenic shock.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to indwelling"

   rate-control for Afib. His coronary angiography on [**1-18**] revealed a
   patent LAD stent but an occluded circumflex, which was not intervented
   on due to desire to avoid need for further anticoagulation in the
   setting of recent drainage of hemorrhagic effusion.  Now that patient
   pericardial output significantly decreased and drain pulled, plan is to
   cath him some time next week.
   - Cardiac cath today
   - Continue ASA, Clopidogrel, BB, statin
   - will start heparin gtt if pt has anginal sx again
   (nausea+diaphoresis+?chest pain), need to differentiate chest pain due
   to pericardial effusion from anginal chest pain
   - SL nitro prn, will start nitro gtt if persistently symptomatic
   - monitor pericarditis/pericardial effusion sx and hct after cath as pt
   will receive heparin during the procedure
   - Monitor closely for signs of cardiac ischemia
   .
   3) Pump: Despite relatively severe and early onset CAD this patient has
   a normal LVEF and no history of clinical heart failure.  Patient had
   signs of early diastolic invagination but no tamponade physiology and
   no hemodynamic disruption on preprocedure echocardiograms.  Repeat TTE
   on [**1-19**] showed minimal pericardial fluid reaccumulation with indirect
   evidence of effusive-constrictive physiology.
   - Continue BB, ACEi
   - maintain negative or equal fluid balance
   .
   4) Rhythm: Patient is in and out of AF and not optimally rate
   controlled.  He is not on Coumadin due to a recent subdural hematoma.
   - Continue Metoprolol 50 mg PO TID
   - continue Diltiazem ER 120mg daily
   - can give 5mg IV metoprolol for Afib with RVR to rate-control
   - Continue ASA, hold coumadin
   .
   5) DM:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale
   .
   6) Anemia: Stable and presumed due to thalassemia minor
   - Daily Hct
   .
   7) Hyperthyroidism:
   - Continue Methimazole at 2.5mg daily
   .
   8) Bowel Disorder: Patient has dependence on bowel regimen that is both
   mechanical and functional.
   - senna, colace, miralax
   - lactulose prn
   - avoid mag citrate

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with known coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and pericarditis/pericardial effusions. He presented to the CCU after balloon pericardiotomy and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has a history of pleuro-pericardial effusion, large left-sided pleural effusion, and a previous small pericardial effusion that was drained. His pleural fluid is non-bloody and transudative in nature. The patient underwent thoracentesis on 1/20, removing 8L of pleural fluid. He also has a patent LAD stent but an occluded circumflex artery, which was not intervened upon due to the desire to avoid further anticoagulation in the setting of recent drainage of hemorrhagic effusion. The patient's pericardial output has significantly decreased, and the drain was pulled. The plan is to catheterize him next week. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleuro-pericardial effusion: The patient has had multiple episodes of pericardial effusion of unclear etiology. There is a large left-sided pleural effusion as well. The patient underwent thoracentesis, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the effusions.
2. NSTEMI: The patient had elevated cardiac"
