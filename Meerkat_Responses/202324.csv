   .
   #. PUMP:  The patient has a history of a mixed picture of
   cardiomyopathy with an EF documented at 40% in [**Month (only) 349**].  Should repeat
   TTE while inpatient to document level of pericardial fluid following
   procedure.  Drain in place.
   - Continue to monitor drain output
   - will check for presence of persistence of pericardial effusion with
   repeat TTE in AM
   - Monitor I/0s and daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES:  This admission coronary catheterization shows patency of
   RCA DES.  No other occlusive coronary artery diease.
   - Continue ASA and plavix

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of mixed cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). She underwent epicardial VT mapping and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a pericardial drain in place due to epicardial ablation. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has several medical conditions including hypertension, depression, GERD, and chronic sinus problems. She is being monitored closely for various parameters such as vital signs, hemodynamics, fluid balance, and laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Rhythm Disturbances: Given the patient's history of VF and inducible VT, there is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of the heart rhythm is essential to detect any abnormalities promptly.
2. Pericardial Effusion/Tamponade: The presence of a pericardial drain suggests the possibility of fluid accumulation in the pericardium. Monitoring the output of the pericardial drain and performing regular echocardiograms will help assess for pericardial effusion or tamponade.
3. Respiratory Complications: Since the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections. Frequent assessment of respiratory status and weaning off sedation and ventilatory support as tolerated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of mixed cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). She underwent epicardial VT mapping and is currently in the CCU with a pericardial drain in place.

24-hour events: The patient had a ventricular arrhythmia, and an arterial line was started. The patient expressed discomfort with the pericardial drain and wanted it removed. The drain has been draining sanginous fluid.

Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate is 87 bpm with a range of 57-87 bpm, blood pressure is 117/73 mmHg with a range of 89-148/52-78 mmHg, respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute with a range of 7-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%.

Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 4,228 mL of IV fluids, with an output of 3,103 mL. The urine output is 1,025 mL.

Lab results:
- Hemoglobin: 10.7 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 33.1%
- Platelet count: 238 K/uL
- Sodium: 135 mg/dL
- Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L
- Chloride: 106 mEq/L
- Glucose: 112 mg/dL

Assessment and Plan:
1. Rhythm: Monitor for any arrhythmias and continue propafenone.
2. Pump: Repeat TTE to document the level of pericardial fluid and continue to monitor drain output. Monitor I/Os and daily weights.
3. Coronaries: Continue ASA and Plavix.
4. Hypertension: Monitor blood pressures closely and hold home regimen of diovan.
5. Respiratory: Monitor respiratory status and plan for extubation after TTE today.
6. Transgender operation: Hold premarin while in the CCU.
7. Depression: Continue lexapro.
8. GERD: Continue zantac.
9. Chronic sinus problems: Continue flonase when extubated.
10. FEN: NPO for now, will start heart healthy diet once extubated.
11. Access: PIV's.
12. Prophylaxis: DVT ppx with heparin SC TID, pain management with NSAIDs and morphine as needed, bowel regimen with colace and senna.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of VF and VT, so monitoring for any arrhythmias is important.
2. Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient has a pericardial drain in place, and close monitoring of the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of mixed cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). She underwent epicardial VT mapping and is currently in the ICU with a pericardial drain in place due to bleeding during the procedure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/73 mmHg to 148/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and sedated but responsive.

The patient has several medical conditions and comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and chronic sinus problems. She is currently on multiple medications, including propafenone, aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, diovan, premarin, lexapro, zantac, and oxazepam.

The assessment and plan include monitoring the patient's rhythm, pump function, coronary arteries, respiratory status, and other medical conditions. The pericardial drain will be continued overnight, and an echocardiogram will be performed today to assess the level of pericardial fluid. If there is no evidence of tamponade physiology and the fluid output continues to decline, the drain may be removed"

- The patient is intubated and sedated, with a stable vital signs profile.
- She has been receiving propofol for sedation and will have her extubation planned after a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) today.
- There is no evidence of tamponade physiology overnight, and the drain output is being monitored.
- The patient's ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) is in place.
- She has a history of coronary artery disease but no new occlusive coronary artery disease.
- The patient has several comorbidities, including hypertension, depression, GERD, and chronic sinus problems.
- The patient's laboratory values are within normal limits.
- She is receiving prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulation, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmia: The patient has a history of VF and inducible VT, which may increase the risk of further ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The presence of a pericardial drain indicates a potential complication of pericardial eff"

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of mixed cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF) after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, no new coronary artery disease, and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) on hospital admission. She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) following epicardial VT mapping.

The patient had a pericardial bleed and is currently on a pericardial drain with minimal drainage over the past 24 hours. There was a 5-point hematocrit (Hct) drop overnight, but no clinical evidence of bleed on examination. The plan is to follow up with a repeat Hct and check the patient's pre-morbid Hct. A focused transthoracic echo (TTE) will be performed in the morning to monitor the stability of the pericardial bleed. If the TTE is stable, the pericardial drain will be pulled today.

The patient has a history of polymorphic and monomorphic VT as well as VF. She has undergone endocardial and epicardial mapping with ablation. Given the epicardial approach, she has a pericardial drain in place. There is an increasing frequency of slow VTs. The plan is to continue Rhythmol (Propafenone) per electrophysiologist (EP) recommendations, initiate Metoprolol for suppression of slow VT,"

   Disposition: CCU while drain in place
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of mixed cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF) post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), no new coronary artery disease (CAD), and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient underwent epicardial VT mapping and is currently in the critical care unit (CCU).

The patient has a pericardial drain in place due to a pericardial bleed, with minimal drainage over the past 24 hours. There was a 5-point hematocrit (Hct) drop overnight, but no clinical evidence of bleeding on examination. The plan is to repeat Hct and check preoperative Hct, perform a focused transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in the morning to monitor the stability of the pericardial bleed, and if TTE is stable, pull the pericardial drain today.

The patient has a history of polymorphic and monomorphic VT as well as VF. She has undergone endocardial and epicardial mapping with ablation. Given the epicardial approach, she has a pericardial drain in place. There has been an increasing frequency of slow VTs. The plan is to continue Rhythm (Propafenone) per electrophysiology (EP) recommendations, initiate Metoprolol for suppression of slow VT, continue ICD in place,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of mixed cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF) after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, no new coronary artery disease (CAD), and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) on hospital admission. She was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) following epicardial VT mapping.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Pericardial bleed: The patient has a drain in place due to a pericardial bleed. Although there has been minimal drainage over the past 24 hours, there was a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) concentration overnight, indicating ongoing blood loss. However, there are no clinical signs of ongoing bleeding. It is planned to repeat the Hct measurement and check the prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/international normalized ratio (INR) levels. If the TTE is stable, the pericardial drain may be removed today.

2. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has a history of polymorphic, monomorphic VT, and VF. She has undergone endocardial and epicardial mapping with ablation. Given the epicardial approach, she has a pericardial drain in place. Increasing frequency of atrial fibrillation (A fib) with aberrancy/slow VTs has been observed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of mixed cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF) after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, no new coronary artery disease (CAD), and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) on hospital admission. She underwent epicardial VT mapping and is currently in the critical care unit (CCU).

The patient has a history of polymorphic and monomorphic VT as well as VF. She has undergone endocardial and epicardial mapping with ablation. Due to the epicardial approach, she has a pericardial drain in place. The trans-thoracic echo (TTE) this morning will evaluate for resolution of effusion.

The patient's pump function is compromised with a documented ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. It is planned to repeat TTE while inpatient to document the level of pericardial fluid following the procedure. However, there is no evidence of tamponade physiology overnight. The drain will be continued to monitor output, and it will be discontinued if fluid output continues to decline and there is no evidence of effusion on ECHO.

The patient's coronary arteries are patent, with no occlusive coronary artery disease. She is already on aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel (plavix), and she will continue with statin therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
 64 year old female with history of mixed cardiomyopathy, VF s/p ICD
   with ICD shocks, no new CAD, and inducible VT on [**Hospital **] transferred to the
   CCU following epicardial VT mapping.
   .
   #.  RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of polymorphic, monomorphic VT
   as well as VF.  She has undergone now endocardial and epicardial
   mapping with ablation.  Given the epicardial approach, she had a
   pericardial drain which was pulled yesterday.
   - Propofenone discontinued
   - Dronedarone to be started Monday after Propofenone washes out

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of mixed cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF), and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). She underwent epicardial VT mapping and had a pericardial drain placed, which was subsequently removed. The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and has been treated with metoprolol IV and orally. Digoxin and dronedarone are planned to be initiated soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation with RVR.
2. Ventricular arrhythmias such as monomorphic VT or VF.
3. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening heart failure or pump failure.
4. Thromboembolic events such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.
5. Pericardial effusion or tamponade, although currently euvolemic.
6. Adverse effects of medications like digoxin, dronedarone, and metoprolol.
7. Hypotension or low blood pressure due to medication effects or other factors.
8. Infection at the site of pericardial drain or other ICU-related infections.
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to immobility.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of mixed cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation (VF) after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). She underwent epicardial VT mapping and has a pericardial drain in place. The patient's recent ejection fraction (EF) is documented at 40%. She also has coronary artery disease with a patent right coronary artery (RCA) and is on dual antiplatelet therapy. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) following an elective intubation for a procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of polymorphic, monomorphic VT, and VF. There is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias, including VT and VF.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's mixed cardiomyopathy and reduced EF, she may be at risk for developing cardiogenic shock, especially if there is significant hemodynamic compromise.
3. Pericardial Effusion: Although the focused transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not show recurrence of pericardial effusion, ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess for any fluid accumulation around the heart.
4. Medication Reactions: The patient has allergies to penicillins, amiodarone, and quinidine. It is important"
