   admitted for multi-drug resistent organism PNA.  Presenting now with
   fever and lethargy
   Fever:  Now growing GPC in clusters from sputum and blood cultures
     -Send surveillance blood cultures.
     -Attempt peripheral IV's and pull PICC. If unable to place p-iv, will
   place central line.
     -continue vancomycin/amikacin/colistin nebs
   Respiratory failure:  Seems to be laboring more this morning
     -Check CXR/ ABG
     -Put back on the vent in the context of new PNA and laboring.
     -Cont pulm toilet.  Depending on CXR, will consider bronchoscopy
   Altered mental status:  Seems related to likely new infection
     -Aspiration precautions
     -Infectious w/u as above.
   Renal Failure:  Cr slightly better now that when he was discharged
     -Renally dose meds and observe.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including multiple admissions in the last 5 months after suffering a subdural hematoma from a fall. He was recently admitted for a multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia. He is currently presenting with fever and lethargy. The patient has been growing gram-positive cocci in clusters from sputum and blood cultures. His respiratory status seems to be worsening, with increased laboring. His mental status is altered, likely due to a new infection. There are concerns about renal failure and the patient's overall prognosis is grave due to co-morbidities and drug-resistant organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, with increased laboring and the possibility of pneumonia. This could lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Infection: The presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters from sputum and blood cultures indicates a possible ongoing infection. If not appropriately treated, this could lead to sepsis and further complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction. It is crucial to monitor and manage his renal function to prevent further deterioration.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's lethargy and altered mental status may be related to the new infection or other underlying conditions. Monitoring and addressing this issue is important to ensure adequate neurological function.
5. Drug-Resistant Organisms"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and a history of MMP (most notably MDR PNA with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas). The patient is currently in the ICU for further treatment and care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has been found to have GPC in their blood from rehab blood cultures. They are currently on vancomycin and there is concern for a line-related infection. The plan is to continue vancomycin, monitor surveillance cultures, and either replace the PICC line with IV access or place a new CVL.
2. MDR PNA: The patient has multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PNA). They are being treated with amikacin and colistin, both of which need to be closely monitored for effectiveness and potential side effects such as acute renal failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has had acute renal failure, which is slowly resolving. This was initially thought to be due to AIN (acute interstitial nephritis) from colistin from the previous admission. Renal dosing of medications will be adjusted as the patient's GFR changes.
4. Parkinson's Disease: The patient has Parkinson's disease and is being treated with Sinemet and Ropinirole. These medications should be continued.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism and is being treated with levothyroxine. This medication should be continued.
6. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which is slightly improved from their recent discharge. Iron studies will be sent, and T&S (transfusion and substitution) will be maintained.
7. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes and is being treated with glargine and SSI. This treatment should be continued.
8. Nutrition: The patient has a PEG tube and will be placed on gentle IVF for insensible losses overnight. Nutren 2.0 TF at 60 mL/hr will be administered.
9. PPX (Prophylaxis): The patient is receiving fondaparinux for DVT PPX (deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis) due to a history of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). They are also taking PO lansoprazole and a bowel regimen.
10. Access: The patient's PICC line from the prior admission will be discontinued, and peripheral lines will be placed.
11. Code Status: The patient is confirmed as full code.
12. Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU for further treatment and care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted to the ICU with fever and altered mental status and has been diagnosed with multidrug-resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas bacteria. He also has bacteremia with Grouped Positive Cocci (GPC) and is currently on vancomycin. The patient has acute renal failure that is resolving, and his creatinine levels are improving. He has a tracheostomy and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His blood cultures from the rehabilitation facility grew Staphylococcus aureus, which is sensitive to vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 98/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels, while his platelet count, creatinine, and potassium levels are within normal range. The patient's medical plan includes continuing vancomycin for GPC bacteremia and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and acute renal failure. The patient has been admitted with fever and altered mental status (AMS) and now presents with gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia.

The patient has a history of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PNA) infection and is currently being treated with vancomycin, amikacin, and colistin for this infection. The patient also has a central venous catheter (CVC) line, which may be related to the GPC bacteremia.

The patient's renal function is improving after acute renal failure, likely due to azathioprine-induced interstitial nephritis (AIN). Parkinson's disease management includes Sinemet and Ropinirole. Hypothyroidism is managed with levothyroxine, and diabetes is managed with glargine and sliding scale insulin (SSI).

Nutrition is provided through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube with Nutren 2.0 formula at 60 mL/hr. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is given due to a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Bowel regimen and stress ulcer prophylaxis are also implemented.

The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been on invasive ventilation since January 30th. The patient developed hypotension and had to have a central line placed, after which the blood pressure recovered. The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and has been receiving multiple antibiotics. The patient's fever was recorded at 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit on January 30th. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,903 mL and output of 1,413 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,490 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 327. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and slightly elevated Cr levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including MDR PNA (multi-drug resistant pneumonia) caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, GPC bacteremia (Gram-positive cocci bacteremia), acute renal failure, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and a history of clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently admitted to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) and is on invasive ventilation.

The patient's recent events include being placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure, development of fever and altered mental status (AMS), and subsequent identification of GPC bacteremia from blood cultures. The patient also had a PICC line (peripheral inserted central catheter) which was removed due to infection and replaced with a triple-lumen R subclavian line.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 60/44 mmHg to 127/71 mmHg, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, increased creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood culture results are pending for multiple samples, as well as the urine culture.

The patient's medications include vancom"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including multiple admissions over the past five months. He was recently admitted for multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia and is now presenting with fever and lethargy. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and altered mental status. He also has renal failure and is being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, amikacin, and colistin nebulizers. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fever and has grown GPC in clusters from sputum and blood cultures. This indicates a potential ongoing infection that needs to be addressed with appropriate treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and seems more comfortable. However, there is a risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to the likely new infection in the context of his overall illness. This can lead to complications such as delirium or worsening encephalopathy.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, and it is important to monitor his creatinine levels and adjust medication dosages accordingly to avoid further deterioration.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immob"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including multiple admissions over the last five months after suffering a subdural hematoma from a fall. He was recently admitted for multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia. He is currently presenting with fever and lethargy. The patient's fever has resolved without intervention. He remains on mechanical ventilation and is comfortable on the ventilator today. He has developed hypotension, which has resolved without intervention. A central line was placed overnight. The patient's respiratory failure is improving with the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). His altered mental status is likely related to a new infection in the context of his overall illness. Renal failure is present, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2903 mL and an output of 1413 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1490 mL. The patient's blood cultures are growing Gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggestive of Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient's family has agreed to a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status. The patient's current medications include simvastatin, requip, lansoprazole, synthroid, fondaparinux, sinemet, ASA, Colistin nebs, peridex, and albuterol/atropine.

   defined course for now given clinical worsening and new GNR in sputum
   of [**1-29**]
   -- appreciate ID recs, if evidence of clinical worsening would prefer
   zosyn for further broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 likely due to increased insensible losses, increase
   free water flushes in TF and will give maintenance IVF

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, anemia, and chronic renal failure. He was admitted with fever and altered mental status and diagnosed with bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci (GPC), specifically MRSA. The patient has a history of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PNA) infection and Acinetobacter species. He is currently on vancomycin for MRSA coverage and amikacin/colistin for MDR PNA. The patient also has hypernatremia, acute renal failure (resolving), and is being treated for Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, anemia, and stress ulcers. The patient has been placed on do not resuscitate (DNR) status and will be kept in the ICU for further treatment and care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA infection: The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia. However, there is a risk of complications such as septic shock, endocarditis, or dissemination to other sites.
2. Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PNA) infection: The patient has a history of MDR PNA infection. Treatment with amikacin and colistin is ongoing, but there is a risk of treatment failure or resistance development.
3. Acute renal failure:"

From the 24-hour events, it is noted that the patient has been intubated and remains so overnight. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) is planned to evaluate for endocarditis. The patient also has MRSA in their sputum.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/71 to 128/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,537 mL and output of 1,180 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving various medications and infusions, including antibiotics, sedatives, and anticoagulants.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The blood culture from the central line shows growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, identified as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The sputum culture reveals"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history and multiple admissions over the last 5 months. He initially suffered a subdural hematoma from a fall and was recently admitted for multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia. Presently, he presents with fever and lethargy, along with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C (102.8°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 103/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on the ventilator. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 1 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 2,537 mL and output of 1,180 mL since 12 AM.

The patient is receiving multiple medications in the ICU, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other supportive treatments. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 136 and 161 mg/dL. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an ongoing infection. Imaging reveals bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. He is diagnosed with bacteremia, respiratory failure, and fever. The plan includes redosing Vancomycin for MRSA"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including multiple admissions over the last 5 months after suffering a subdural hematoma from a fall. He was recently admitted for multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia. The patient is currently presenting with fever and lethargy, MRSA bacteremia, and pneumonia. He has a PICC line out and is experiencing respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator and shows signs of chronic respiratory failure. If the patient's mental status does not improve, there may be a need to reassess the airway and repeat bronchoscopy. Liberation from the ventilator may be delayed until the mental status improves.

2. Infection: The patient has MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications. The infectious workup and treatment plan should be continued as mentioned earlier.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and it is recommended to add free water flush to correct this electrolyte imbalance.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is at baseline, and there are plans to advance the total fluid intake to goal. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting fluid management accordingly is important.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status seems related to a new infection in the context of overall illness. It is important to continue with the infectious workup and treatment as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with a temperature of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, respiratory failure, and fever. They have been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the blood can lead to various complications such as sepsis, septic shock, organ failure, and abscess formation.
2. Respiratory Failure: Chronic respiratory failure can result in worsening lung function, difficulty breathing, decreased oxygen levels, and potential respiratory arrest.
3. Fever: The elevated body temperature indicates an inflammatory response, which may be caused by an underlying infection or other conditions. If not managed appropriately, it could progress to more severe systemic infections.
4. Potential drug allergies: The patient has documented allergies to certain medications, including Tagamet, Ditropan, penicillins, lisinopril, and heparin agents. These allergies should be taken into consideration when prescribing future medications.
5. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count (214 K/uL) suggests a possible complication of heparin therapy, which can lead to bleeding or clotting disorders.

   TTE [**2169-2-1**] The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid to distal
   septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
   aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is a
   probable vegetation on the aortic valve. There is moderate aortic valve
   stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Significant aortic regurgitation is present,
   but cannot be quantified. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-1-4**], the
   severity of aortic stenosis is similar. There seems to be a calcified
   leaflet that is more mobile than seen in the prior echo, possible
   vegetation. A transesophageal echocardiographic examination is
   recommended to further evaluate the aortic valve.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, chronic anemia, and a history of resistant Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas infections. The patient presented with fever and altered mental status and was found to have MRSA pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further care and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, which is a serious infection that can be difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance. This infection may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially progress to sepsis or septic shock.

2. Endocarditis: The transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a probable vegetation on the aortic valve with moderate aortic valve stenosis and significant aortic regurgitation. These findings are concerning for infective endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves. If left untreated, it can lead to valve damage, heart failure, or embolic events.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient had acute renal failure during a previous admission, which was thought to be associated with colistin use. Although the creatinine level is currently improving, careful monitoring of renal function is necessary to avoid further deterioration.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient is experiencing hypernatremia, which is likely due to increased insensible losses"

   TTE [**2169-2-1**] The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid to distal
   septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
   aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is a
   probable vegetation on the aortic valve. There is moderate aortic valve
   stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Significant aortic regurgitation is present,
   but cannot be quantified. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-1-4**], the
   severity of aortic stenosis is similar. There seems to be a calcified
   leaflet that is more mobile than seen in the prior echo, possible
   vegetation. A transesophageal echocardiographic examination is
   recommended to further evaluate the aortic valve.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA), currently infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient presented with fever and altered mental status (AMS) and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, anemia, hypothyroidism, and Parkinson's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a tracheostomy and was previously on mechanical ventilation. There is concern for ongoing respiratory distress, and the patient is currently maintained on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 30%.

2. Infection: The patient has MDR PNA with positive cultures for MRSA. He is being treated with vancomycin, amikacin, and colistin. There is also a concern for aortic valve vegetation, which may indicate endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to further evaluate the aortic valve.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated serum sodium levels, likely due to increased insensible losses. Free water flushes have been increased, and maintenance intravenous fluids are being given.

4. Acute Renal Failure (AIN): The patient had a previous episode of acute kidney injury (AIN) from colistin during a previous admission. His creat"

   TTE [**2169-2-1**] The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid to distal
   septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
   aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is a
   probable vegetation on the aortic valve. There is moderate aortic valve
   stenosis (area 1.0cm2). Significant aortic regurgitation is present,
   but cannot be quantified. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-1-4**], the
   severity of aortic stenosis is similar. There seems to be a calcified
   leaflet that is more mobile than seen in the prior echo, possible
   vegetation. A transesophageal echocardiographic examination is
   recommended to further evaluate the aortic valve.
   Assessment and Plan

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and chronic renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU with a fever and altered mental status (AMS), and was found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.8°F, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, sodium of 161 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 144 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures were positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, but the significance is unclear.

The patient has a history of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PNA) and is currently being treated with amikacin and colistin for MRSA pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has been improving, and he is now comfortable on CPAP/PSV ventilation. However, his mental status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including multiple admissions over the last five months after suffering a subdural hematoma from a fall. The patient was recently admitted for multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia. He is currently presenting with fever and lethargy, and there is evidence of bacteremia and MRSA + GNR pneumonia. The patient's central line has been removed, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) shows possible aortic vegetations. The patient is on vancomycin, colistin inhaler, and amikacin. The attending cardiologist does not think he is a candidate for TEE.

The patient has ongoing fever and leukocytosis, but subsequent blood cultures are negative. The plan is to continue antibiotic therapy and monitor the fever curve. A CT chest may be ordered if the fever does not resolve, and the possibility of bronchitis is being considered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history who has been admitted multiple times over the past five months. He is currently in the ICU due to multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia and presents with fever and lethargy. The patient has bacteremia and MRSA + GNR pneumonia, and his PICC line was removed. The patient's TTE shows possible aortic vegetations. 

The patient is being treated with vancomycin, colistin inhaler, and amikacin. The attending physician does not think the patient is a candidate for TEE. The patient's ongoing fever and leukocytosis are being monitored, but subsequent blood cultures are negative. 

The patient's pneumonia will be followed with sputum cultures, continued antibiotic therapy, and a fever curve. If the fever does not resolve, a CT chest will be considered. The possibility of bronchitis is also being considered. 

The patient's bacteremia is being treated, and subsequent cultures are negative. The patient is committed to endocarditis treatment duration, and his fever curve and EKG will be followed. 

The patient's respiratory failure will be managed with continued pulmonary toilet and PSV mode ventilation with a pressure support of 5/5. 

The patient's hypernatremia will be addressed with free water flush. 

The patient's renal failure is at baseline, and fluid restriction will be advanced to goal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of multiple allergies, including anaphylaxis to certain medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,410 mL and output of 2,125 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture are pending. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.7 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 207 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia may indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to chronic respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not adequately supported.
3. Line-related Infection: The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line inserted on 1/31/2017. There is a risk of developing"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, admitted with fever and altered mental status (AMS). The patient now has MRSA PNA and continues to be on vancomycin for coverage. The patient also has a tracheostomy and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation support due to respiratory failure.

The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 147 mEq/L. The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged PT/PTT/INR, likely due to the use of anticoagulants.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, and chronic renal failure. He is on multiple medications including insulin, Sinemet, levothyroxine, iron supplements, and Glargine.

The patient's condition is complicated by hypernatremia, metabolic encephalopathy, acute renal failure (AIN from colistin), and parkinsonism. The patient is also on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of MDR PNA and now has MRSA PNA."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, admitted with fever and altered mental status (AMS), now diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, amikacin, and colistin, but continues to have clinical worsening. He also has a history of previous endocarditis, chronic anemia, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation support is crucial.
2. Persistent Fevers: The patient's fever is unclear whether it is secondary to ongoing pneumonia or another source. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause.
3. Coag-Neg Staph Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. Monitoring and surveillance cultures should be continued, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered based on sensitivities.
4. Aortic Valve Vegetation: The patient has a history of previous endocarditis, and there is a concern for aortic valve vegetation on TTE. Long-term antibiotic therapy should be considered.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to increased"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including multiple admissions over the past 5 months after suffering a subdural hematoma from a fall. He has been recently admitted for multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia and is currently presenting with fever, lethargy, bacteremia, and possible aortic vegetations on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient is on vancomycin, colistin inhaler, and amikacin. He has ongoing fever, leukocytosis, but subsequent blood cultures are negative. The patient has pneumonia, which will be followed with sputum cultures, continuation of antibiotics, and monitoring of the fever curve. A CT chest may be done if the fever does not resolve. The patient also has bacteremia, which is now negative on subsequent cultures, and possible endocarditis. The patient's respiratory failure will be managed with pulmonary toilet and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O. The patient has hypernatremia, and a free water flush will be added. The patient's renal failure is at baseline, and his target fluid is to be advanced. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he will remain in the ICU until his mental status improves and he can participate in weaning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including multiple admissions over the last 5 months after suffering a subdural hematoma from a fall. He was recently admitted for multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU due to bacteremia, respiratory failure, and fever. He has been diagnosed with possible endocarditis, pneumonia caused by GNR (Gram-negative rods), and chronic respiratory failure. The patient is on various medications including vancomycin, colistin inhaler, amikacin, and others. His vital signs show an elevated temperature, increased heart rate, and slightly low blood pressure. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. Imaging shows bibasilar infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and treatment in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by GNR. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of sepsis, and potentially respiratory failure.
2. Endocarditis: The presence of aortic vegetations on TTE suggests possible endocarditis. If untreated, it can lead to further deterioration of the patient's condition, including systemic infection, heart"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple complex medical conditions, including chronic respiratory failure, fever, bacteremia, and suspected aortic vegetations. He was recently admitted for multi-drug resistant organism pneumonia and has a history of subdural hematoma from a fall. The patient's current vital signs show fever, sinus tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 30%, PEEP 5 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.7, elevated CRP, and elevated lactic acid levels. His renal function is at baseline with a creatinine level of 1.9 and BUN of 24.1. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but he remains febrile. He has a history of multiple allergies, including anaphylaxis to penicillins. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for pneumonia, bacteremia, and potential endocarditis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to the ongoing infection and pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Endocarditis: The presence of possible aortic vegetations on the TTE raises concerns for endocarditis. This condition requires prompt"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old male with Parkinsons
 disease, complicated medical course
   since [**8-/2168**] after fall and SDH including endocarditis and MDR PNA
   with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas admitted with fever and altered mental
   status, MRSA bacteremia and PNA.
   # MRSA bacteremia:
 OSH blood cultures positive from PICC line placed
   last admission.  PICC line discontinued.  TTE this admission with
   likely aortic valve vegetation, similar to prior TTE.  Will empirically
   treat for endocarditis with six-week course of vancomycin.
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Monitor surveillance cultures
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # MDR PNA:  History of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas with
   consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - Continue amikacin and colistin

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, complicated medical course since [8-/2168] after fall and SDH including endocarditis and MDR PNA with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas. He was admitted with fever and altered mental status, MRSA bacteremia, and PNA. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including vancomycin, amikacin, and colistin. He continues to have persistent fevers, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, anemia, acute renal failure, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and diabetes. The patient's code status is DNR and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, MDR PNA with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas, and endocarditis. There is a potential risk of further infection due to the ongoing fevers and positive blood cultures.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on a ventilator and has a history of respiratory distress. There is a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure if the current treatment does not improve his condition.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which is thought to be AIN from colistin. There is a potential risk of worsening renal function if the current treatment continues.
4. Hypotension: The"

   67 year-old male with Parkinsons
 disease, complicated medical course
   since [**8-/2168**] after fall and SDH including endocarditis and MDR PNA
   with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas admitted with fever and altered mental
   status, MRSA bacteremia and PNA.
   # MRSA bacteremia:
 OSH blood cultures positive from PICC line placed
   last admission.  PICC line discontinued.  TTE this admission with
   likely aortic valve vegetation, similar to prior TTE.  Will empirically
   treat for endocarditis with prolonged course of vancomycin.
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Monitor surveillance cultures
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # MDR PNA:  History of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas with
   consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
   - Continue vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - Continue amikacin and colistin
 extending previously defined course
   per ID recommendations
   - Continue zosyn for now to for broad-spectrum coverage in setting of
   continued fevers
 consider d/c if no new sputum culture results
   # Altered mental status: Improves on and off.  Likely toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy in the setting of infection.  Head CT negative for acute
   processes.  ABG without acute change.
   - Treatment as above
   - Continue to monitor
   # Respiratory failure: Patient on trach mask as outpatient.
   Respiratory distress on and off during admission requiring intermittent
   ventilation.
   - Respiratory support with ventilator as needed, otherwise trach mask
   # Persistent fevers: MRSA bacteremia from OSH.  MRSA and
   Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas PNA as above.  No other source identified on
   CT torso [**2-3**].
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water repletion.  Monitor.
   # Acute renal failure: Improving.  Thought to be AIN from colistin from
   last admission, however, improvement on continued colistin.  Cr slowly
   improving (2.1 on admission and now 1.9; 2.8 on discharge on [**1-24**]).
   Good urine output.
   - Renally dose medications appropriately with changing GFR
   .
   # Parkinson
s disease: No active issues.
   - Continue Sinemet and Ropinirole.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Continue levothyroxine 88 mcg.
   .
   # Anemia: At recent baseline.  No signs or symptoms of active
   bleeding.  Guaiac negative last admission.
   - Monitor

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with Parkinson's disease, complicated medical history since [8/2168] after a fall and subdural hematoma (SDH), including endocarditis and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PNA). He was admitted with fever and altered mental status, MRSA bacteremia, and pneumonia.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has likely aortic valve vegetation, similar to prior transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Empirically, he is being treated for endocarditis with a prolonged course of vancomycin.

2. MDR PNA: The patient has a history of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas with consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA. He will continue vancomycin for MRSA coverage, amikacin, and colistin extending previously defined course per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations. Zosyn will be continued for broad-spectrum coverage in the setting of continued fevers, considering discontinuation if no new sputum culture results.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status improves on and off, likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of infection. A head CT is negative for acute processes, and arterial blood gas (ABG) without acute change. Treatment remains the same, and continuous"

   67 year-old male with complicated medical course since [**8-/2168**] after
   fall and SDH including endocarditis and MDR PNA with
   Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas admitted with fever and altered mental
   status, MRSA bacteremia and PNA.
   # MDR PNA:  History of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas with
   consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
   - Continue vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - Continue amikacin 750 mg QOD; colistin 75 mg inhaled Q8 hours
   - Continue zosyn for now to for broad-spectrum coverage in setting of
   continued fevers
 consider d/c if no new sputum culture results
   # Respiratory failure: Patient with chronic tracheostomy, was
   transitioned to a rate after SBT with some distress on [**1-31**], now back
   on CPAP/PS and comfortable.
   - will maintain on vent for now given resp distress on trach mask and
   rapid worsening of CXR
   # Persistent fevers: MRSA bacteremia from OSH.  MRSA and
   Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas PNA as above.  No other source identified on
   CT torso [**2-3**].
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Continue to monitor
   # MRSA bacteremia: From OSH blood cultures taken from PICC.  PICC line
   discontinued.  TTE with likely aortic valve vegetation, similar to
   prior TTE.  Will empirically treat for endocarditis with prolonged
   course of antibiotics.
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Monitor surveillance cultures
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # Altered mental status: Improves on and off.  Likely toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy in the setting of infection.  Head CT negative for acute
   processes.  ABG without acute change.
   - Treatment as above
   - Continue to monitor
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water repletion.  Monitor.
   # Acute renal failure: Improving.  Thought to be AIN from colistin from
   last admission, however, improvement on continued colistin.  Cr slowly
   improving (2.1 on admission and now 1.9; 2.8 on discharge on [**1-24**]).
   Good urine output.
   - Renally dose medications appropriately with changing GFR
   .
   #. Parkinson
s disease: No active issues.
   - Continue Sinemet and Ropinirole.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Continue levothyroxine 88 mcg.
   .
   #. Anemia: At recent baseline.  No signs or symptoms of active
   bleeding.  Guaiac negative last admission.
   - Monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history since [8-/2168] after a fall and subdural hematoma (SDH), including endocarditis and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PNA). He was admitted with fever and altered mental status, MRSA bacteremia, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic tracheostomy and was transitioned to CPAP/PSV after spontaneous breathing test (SBT) but experienced distress. He is currently on CPAP/PSV and will be maintained on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and rapid worsening of chest X-ray.
2. Persistent Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers despite antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia and MDR PNA. No other source has been identified on CT torso.
3. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient had MRSA bacteremia from an outdoor shelter (OSH) blood cultures taken from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, which has been discontinued. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed likely aortic valve vegetation, similar to prior TTE, and he will empirically treat for endocarditis with a prolonged course of antibiotics.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status improves on and off, likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a cloudy urine culture. The patient has allergies to specific medications and has received various antibiotics in the past 24 hours. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and borderline low blood pressure. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance indicates an overall positive balance of 4,121 mL with input exceeding output. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently high.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The cloudy urine culture suggests a possible UTI. If left untreated, this can lead to complications such as sepsis or kidney infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating potential hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Fever: The patient's elevated body temperature suggests a fever, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation. It is important to identify the source of infection to prevent further complications.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The consistently high blood glucose levels may indicate poor glycemic control, potentially leading to DKA. This is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.
5. Acute Kidney"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (MDR PNA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.
- The patient was admitted with fever and altered mental status (AMS) and now has MRSA pneumonia.
- The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement followed by clinical worsening.
- The patient has persistent fevers, unclear if secondary to ongoing pneumonia or another source.
- Coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia was identified, and the PICC line was removed.
- There is a concern for possible endocarditis, given the patient's history of previous endocarditis and visualization of aortic valve vegetation on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
- The patient is hypernatremic and will receive increased free water flushes and maintenance IV fluids.
- The patient has poor mental status, likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of infection.
- Acute renal failure was previously observed but is now resolving.
- The patient has Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and is receiving enteral nutrition.
- Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with fondaparinux and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and a history of previous endocarditis. He was admitted with fever and altered mental status and has been diagnosed with multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species. The patient also has MRSA and a coag-negative staphylococcal bacteremia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory status has been fluctuating. He has persistent fevers, and a torso CT scan is planned to look for other sources of infection. The patient has acute renal failure, which is resolving, and his electrolyte imbalances need to be corrected. He is also receiving treatment for diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and a prophylactic dose of fondaparinux for deep vein thrombosis prevention due to his history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient has been placed on a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order and will continue ICU care. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration and the need for more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Persistent fevers: Despite ongoing antibiotic treatment, the patient continues to have fevers, which may indicate an ongoing"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species. The patient presented with fever and altered mental status and was found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

Overnight, the patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for one hour and was placed back on pressure support (PS) of 10/5. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) this morning is 49.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the torso was done yesterday to look for occult infection, but the preliminary read is negative. The patient had a fever of 100.5 degrees overnight.

The patient has several allergies, including Tagamet (oral), Ditropan (oral), penicillins, lisinopril, and heparin agents.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature (Tmax) of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.5 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.4 degrees Celsius (97.6 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate (HR) of 118 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 122/69 to 137/99 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 27 breaths per minute, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease, subdural hematoma, bacteremia, endocarditis, and multiple recent hospital admissions for MDR pathogen pneumonias. He was admitted to the ICU with fever and altered mental status, and was found to have CNS bacteremia. He has a history of MRSA in his sputum and scattered ground glass opacities on chest CT, but no significant consolidation. He is currently on broad antibiotic coverage and will receive a 6-week course. His mental status appears to be near baseline, but he is failing the tracheostomy mask. Further plans will be made according to the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to endocarditis and recent hospital admissions for MDR pneumonias puts him at risk for further infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in mental status, is crucial.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's failure to tolerate the tracheostomy mask suggests a potential respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of his respiratory status, including oxygenation, ventilation, and airway patency, is necessary. Adjustments to ventilation settings or consideration of alternative airway management strategies may be required.

3. Neurological deterioration: The patient's altered mental status and history of subdural hematoma increase the risk of neurological deterioration. Frequent"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old male with Parkinsons
 disease, complicated medical course
   since [**8-/2168**] after fall and SDH including endocarditis and MDR PNA
   with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas admitted with fever and altered mental
   status; found to have MRSA PNA.
   # MDR PNA:  History of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas with
   consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue vancomycin for 14-day course for MRSA coverage
   - Continue amikacin and colistin
 can likely d/c tomorrow per ID
   - Discontinued zosyn [**2-4**]
   # Persistent fevers: Now afebrile x 24 hours.  MRSA and
   Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas PNA as above.  No other source identified on
   CT torso [**2-3**].
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - No new positive culture data
   - Continue to monitor
   # Respiratory failure: Patient on intermittent trach mask as
   outpatient.  Respiratory distress on and off during admission requiring
   intermittent ventilation, likely due to PNA, fluid overload, and
   component of ICU myopathy.
   - Will diurese with lasix for goal -1-1.5L
   - Respiratory support with ventilator as needed, otherwise trach mask
   # Anemia: Hematocrit drop from yesterday without signs or symptoms of
   active bleeding.  Guaiac negative.  Likely due to laboratory error, but
   will recheck now.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Improved.  Likely toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy in the setting of infection.  Head CT negative for acute
   processes.  ABG without acute change.
   - Treatment as above
   - Continue to monitor
   # MRSA bacteremia:
 OSH blood cultures positive from PICC line placed
   last admission
 coagulase negative Staph and presumed contaminant.
   PICC line discontinued.  TTE this admission with likely aortic valve
   vegetation, similar to prior TTE
 believed unlikely to represent new
   endocarditis.
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue vancomycin for a 14-day course for PNA as above
   - Monitor surveillance cultures
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable; improved from 2.8 last
   discharge [**1-24**].  Thought to be AIN from colistin from last admission,
   however, improvement on continued colistin.  Good urine output.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water repletion.
   - Monitor
   # Parkinson
s disease: No active issues.
   - Continue Sinemet and Ropinirole
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Continue Levothyroxine 88 mcg
   # Diabetes: No acute issues.
   - Continue Glargine 34 units QHS + SSI

   with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas admitted with fever and altered mental
   status, MRSA bacteremia and PNA.
   # MRSA bacteremia:
 OSH blood cultures positive from PICC line placed
   last admission.  PICC line discontinued.  TTE this admission with
   likely aortic valve vegetation, similar to prior TTE.  Will empirically
   treat for endocarditis with six-week course of vancomycin.
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Monitor surveillance cultures
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # MDR PNA:  History of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas with
   consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - Continue amikacin and colistin
 extending previously defined course
   per ID recommendations
   - Discontinued zosyn [**2-4**]
   # Persistent fevers: MRSA bacteremia from OSH.  MRSA and
   Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas PNA as above.  No other source identified on

   encephalopathy in the setting of infection.  Head CT negative for acute
   processes.  ABG without acute change.
   - Treatment as above
   - Continue to monitor
   # Respiratory failure: Patient on trach mask as outpatient.
   Respiratory distress on and off during admission requiring intermittent
   ventilation, likely due to PNA and component of ICU myopathy.
   - Respiratory support with ventilator as needed, otherwise trach mask
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water repletion.  Monitor.
   # Anemia: At recent baseline.  No signs or symptoms of active
   bleeding.  Guaiac negative last admission.
   - Monitor
   # Acute renal failure: Cr slowly improving (2.1 on admission and now
   1.9; 2.8 on discharge on [**1-24**]).  Thought to be AIN from colistin from
   last admission, however, improvement on continued colistin.  Good urine
   output.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including Parkinson's disease, who was admitted with fever and altered mental status. He has been diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia caused by Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas, which is multidrug-resistant. The patient also has evidence of endocarditis and has been empirically treated with vancomycin. His respiratory failure is likely due to the pneumonia and component of ICU myopathy. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with free water repletion, and his acute renal failure is slowly improving. He is currently receiving multiple medications and treatments in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. MRSA bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which can be challenging to treat. There is a risk of persistent or recurrent bacteremia despite antibiotic therapy.

2. Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PNA): The patient's pneumonia is caused by MDR Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas, which is difficult to treat due to its resistance to multiple antibiotics. The risk of treatment failure and progression of the infection exists.

3. Endocarditis: The patient has likely developed endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves. This can lead to further complications such as heart failure, embolism, or septic shock if not properly managed.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying pneumonia is not adequately treated, leading to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for prolonged ventilatory support.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration or the development of chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.

6. Hypernatremia: Although the patient's hypernatremia has resolved, there is a risk of its recurrence due to fluid imbalances or inadequate management of electrolytes.

7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but it is at baseline levels. Monitoring is recommended to ensure that it does not worsen and to address any underlying causes.

8. Parkinson's disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease should be managed concurrently with the acute issues, ensuring that his medications for this condition are not disrupted.

9. Hypothyroidism and diabetes: These chronic conditions require ongoing management and monitoring in the ICU setting.

Overall, the patient's prognosis is guarded due to the presence of multiple comorbidities, infections, and organ dysfunctions. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial for the patient's recovery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and several complicated medical conditions, including endocarditis and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia. He was admitted with fever and altered mental status, and found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the pneumonia and ICU myopathy. He has resolved hypernatremia and his acute renal failure is improving, possibly due to acute interstitial nephritis from colistin. The patient's other chronic conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and diabetes, are stable. The patient is currently on multiple medications for his various infections and conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially develop into septic shock.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of endocarditis and current evidence of aortic valve vegetation on TTE. This increases the risk of complications such as heart failure, embolic events, and further systemic infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications based on changing GFR are necessary.
4. ICU Myopathy: The patient has been requiring intermittent ventilation due to respiratory distress, which can contribute to ICU myopathy. This"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and a complicated medical history including endocarditis and multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) since August 2018 after a fall and subdural hematoma. He was admitted with fever and altered mental status, and was found to have MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia. 

The patient has been febrile but is now afebrile for 24 hours. He has MRSA bacteremia from an outside hospital (OSH) and both MRSA and Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas pneumonia. No other source of infection has been identified on CT torso. 

The patient's altered mental status has improved and is likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of infection. A head CT showed no acute processes, and the ABG did not show any acute changes. 

The patient has experienced respiratory failure, requiring intermittent ventilation, likely due to pneumonia and component of ICU myopathy. He is currently on a tracheostomy mask. 

The patient had hypernatremia but it has resolved with free water repletion. He has anemia at recent baseline, with no signs or symptoms of active bleeding. 

The patient's acute renal failure is slowly improving, with creatinine levels decreasing from 2.1 on admission to 1.9 now. It is thought to be acute tubular necrosis (AIN) from colistin from the last admission, but improvement"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and a complicated medical history. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with fever and altered mental status, and has a history of MRSA bacteremia and MDR PNA with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/55 mmHg to 146/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, using CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 461 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals comfort, symmetric chest expansion with forced expiration, no wheezes, non-tender distended abdomen, and peripheral pulses present. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19800 cells/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's platelet count is normal. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for MRSA bacteremia and MDR PNA with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas, monitoring for any signs of endocarditis, and management of other comorbidities such as Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and acute renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), hospital-acquired infections due to central venous catheters or urinary catheters, worsening of Parkinson's disease symptoms, and potential exacerbation of diabetes or hypothyroidism."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease and a history of multiple hospital admissions for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) with multiply-resistant pathogens. He is currently admitted with fever and altered mental status due to MRSA pneumonia. The patient has failed tracheostomy mask ventilation, and his fever has resolved. He has allergies to cimetidine, oxybutynin chloride, penicillins, and heparin agents. He is on various ICU medications and infusions. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/59 to 141/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilator support with FiO2 of 30% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Physical examination shows symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and extremities with 1+ edema. Neurologic examination reveals the patient responding to verbal stimuli but with unassessed movement, tone, and skin. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is improving, with mental status approaching baseline. He has chronic respiratory failure and will be weaned off chronic ventilation and undergo tracheostomy removal. His hematocrit will be rechecked, and transfusion will be considered if it falls below 21%. Further plans are according to the resident's note."

   67 year-old male with Parkinsons
 disease, complicated medical course
   since [**8-/2168**] after fall and SDH including endocarditis and MDR PNA
   with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas admitted with fever and altered mental
   status; found to have MRSA PNA.
   # MDR PNA:  History of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas with
   consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue vancomycin for 14-day course for MRSA coverage
   - Continue amikacin and colistin
 can likely d/c tomorrow per ID
   - Discontinued zosyn [**2-4**]
   # Persistent fevers: Now afebrile x 24 hours.  MRSA and
   Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas PNA as above.  No other source identified on
   CT torso [**2-3**].
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - No new positive culture data
   - Continue to monitor
   # Respiratory failure: Patient on intermittent trach mask as
   outpatient.  Respiratory distress on and off during admission requiring
   intermittent ventilation, likely due to PNA, fluid overload, and
   component of ICU myopathy.
   - Will diurese with lasix for goal -1-1.5L
   - Respiratory support with ventilator as needed, otherwise trach mask
   # Anemia: Hematocrit drop from yesterday without signs or symptoms of
   active bleeding.  Guaiac negative.  Likely due to laboratory error, but
   will recheck now.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Improved.  Likely toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy in the setting of infection.  Head CT negative for acute
   processes.  ABG without acute change.
   - Treatment as above
   - Continue to monitor
   # MRSA bacteremia:
 OSH blood cultures positive from PICC line placed
   last admission
 coagulase negative Staph and presumed contaminant.
   PICC line discontinued.  TTE this admission with likely aortic valve
   vegetation, similar to prior TTE
 believed unlikely to represent new
   endocarditis.
   - ID following; appreciate
   - Continue vancomycin for a 14-day course for PNA as above
   - Monitor surveillance cultures
   - Monitor on telemetry
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable; improved from 2.8 last
   discharge [**1-24**].  Thought to be AIN from colistin from last admission,
   however, improvement on continued colistin.  Good urine output.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water repletion.
   - Monitor
   # Parkinson
s disease: No active issues.
   - Continue Sinemet and Ropinirole
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Continue Levothyroxine 88 mcg

   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - No new positive culture data
   - Continue to monitor
   # Respiratory failure: Patient on intermittent trach mask as
   outpatient.  Respiratory distress on and off during admission requiring
   intermittent ventilation, likely due to PNA, fluid overload, and
   component of ICU myopathy.
   - Will diurese with lasix for goal -1-1.5L
   - Respiratory support with ventilator as needed, otherwise trach mask
   # Anemia: Hematocrit drop from yesterday without signs or symptoms of
   active bleeding.  Guaiac negative.  Likely due to laboratory error, but
   will recheck now.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor

   # Respiratory Failure: patient with trach, was transitioned to a rate
   after SBT with some distress on [**1-31**], now back on CPAP/PS and
   comfortable.
   - will maintain on vent for now given resp distress on trach mask and
   rapid worsening of CXR
   # Persistent Fevers
 unclear if this is secondary to ongoing known
   pneumonia or if there is another source. Will non-con torso CT him to
   look for other sources.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and a complicated medical history, including endocarditis and multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) caused by Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas. He was admitted with fever and altered mental status and is currently in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had intermittent respiratory distress on and off during admission, requiring intermittent ventilation. He is currently on CPAP/PSV with a tracheostomy tube.
2. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient had positive blood cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which was initially thought to be a contaminant from the PICC line. However, aortic valve vegetation seen on TTE suggests possible endocarditis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had elevated creatinine levels, which have now stabilized and improved from previous levels. It is thought to be associated with Aminoglycoside-induced Nephrotoxicity (AIN) from colistin.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient had elevated sodium levels, likely due to increased insensible losses, and was treated with free water repletion.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, possibly related to his Parkinson's disease or an inflammatory state.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has chronic hypothyroidism requiring levothy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including Parkinson's disease, who was admitted with fever and altered mental status. He has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and previously had a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The patient is currently afebrile but still requires respiratory support. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 104-160 mmHg, heart rate between 83-107 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on the ventilator.

The patient has a history of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas infection with consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA. He has been receiving vancomycin for 14 days to cover MRSA, and amikacin and colistin have been discontinued for a previous Amikacin/Klebsiella pneumonia.

The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.7 thousand/mm³, anemia with a hematocrit of 24.5%, and normal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

Radiology:
The chest X-ray shows persistent bilateral pleural effusions and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Increased opacities involving both lungs remain similar in appearance compared"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year-old male with Parkinsons
 disease, complicated medical course
   since [**8-/2168**] after fall and SDH including endocarditis and MDR PNA
   with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas admitted with fever and altered mental
   status; found to have MRSA PNA.
   # MDR PNA:  History of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas with
   consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
   - ID following; appreciate recs
   - Continue vancomycin for 14-day course for MRSA coverage, check trough
   in am
   - DC amikacin/colistin for previous Amikacin/Klebsiella PNA
   - Discontinued zosyn [**2-4**]
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Now afebrile x 24 hours.  MRSA and
   Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas PNA as above.  No other source identified on
   CT torso [**2-3**].
   - ID following; appreciate recs
   - Continue Vanco as above
   - No new positive culture data
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient on intermittent trach mask as
   outpatient.  Respiratory distress on and off during admission requiring
   intermittent ventilation, likely due to PNA, fluid overload, and
   component of ICU myopathy.
   - Will diurese with lasix for goal -1-1.5L
   - Respiratory support with ventilator as needed, otherwise trach mask
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit drop from yesterday without signs or symptoms of
   active bleeding.  Guaiac negative.  Given 1 UPRBC yest.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor
   .
   # Altered mental status: Improved.  Likely toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy in the setting of infection.  Head CT negative for acute
   processes.  ABG without acute change.
   - Treatment as above
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # CoNS + blood cx bacteremia:
 OSH blood cultures positive from PICC
   line placed last admission
 coagulase negative Staph and presumed
   contaminant.  PICC line discontinued.  TTE this admission with likely
   aortic valve vegetation, similar to prior TTE
 believed unlikely to
   represent new endocarditis.
   - Monitor surveillance cultures
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable; improved from 2.8 last
   discharge [**1-24**].  Thought to be AIN from colistin from last admission,
   however, improvement on continued colistin.  Good urine output.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water repletion.
   - Monitor
   .
   # Parkinson
s disease: No active issues.
   - Continue Sinemet and Ropinirole

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who was admitted to the ICU with fever and altered mental status. He was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been on antibiotics for GNR coverage due to a history of chronic colonization. His mental status is now approaching baseline, and he is expected to continue with a 6-week course of vancomycin. The patient's impaired physical mobility, hypernatremia (high sodium), bacteremia, and chronic respiratory failure are being closely monitored. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobility can lead to muscle weakness, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pressure ulcers.
2. Hypernatremia can cause symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and dehydration.
3. Bacteremia may lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that can result in organ failure.
4. Chronic respiratory failure can progress to respiratory arrest if not managed properly.
5. Given the patient's Parkinson's disease, there is a risk of complications related to the disease, such as dyskinesia or medication-induced side effects.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional clinical details may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease and multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MRSA pneumonia). He was admitted with fever and altered mental status. The patient had been on GNR coverage for chronic colonization and is now being treated with vancomycin. His mental status is approaching baseline, but he still has impaired physical mobility, hypernatremia (high sodium), bacteremia, chronic respiratory failure, and fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired physical mobility: The patient's inability to move properly can lead to muscle weakness, joint stiffness, and increased risk of bedsores, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Hypernatremia: Elevated sodium levels can cause dehydration, confusion, seizures, and neurological dysfunction.
3. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream can result in sepsis, organ failure, and increased risk of infection.
4. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's long-term inability to breathe properly can lead to respiratory muscle weakness, pneumonia, and increased risk of complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Fever: Uncontrolled fever can indicate an underlying infection, increase metabolic demand, and potentially lead to organ dysfunction and sepsis.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including Parkinson's disease, who was admitted with fever and altered mental status. He has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and MDR PNA caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. The patient has shown improvement, with defervescence and borderline temperature this morning. His respiratory failure is slowly improving, and he is tolerating a passy muir valve. The patient's anemia is being treated with blood transfusion, and his altered mental status is being managed with continued treatment for infection. Surveillance cultures are being monitored due to a previous blood culture positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (presumed contaminant). The patient's acute renal failure is improving, and he is being monitored for hypernatremia. His Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and diabetes are being managed with their respective medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory distress due to ongoing secretions from his pneumonia and altered mental status.
2. Infection: There is a risk of recurrent infections, especially with resistant organisms such as MRSA and Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit drop should be monitored, and further blood transfusions may be required if necessary.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may fluctuate, and close monitoring is essential"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including Parkinson's disease, who has been admitted to the ICU since [8/2168] after a fall and subdural hematoma. The patient presented with fever and altered mental status and was found to have MRSA pneumonia. The patient also had a history of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas infection with consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Impaired physical mobility
- Hypernatremia (high sodium)
- Bacteremia
- Chronic respiratory failure
- Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)

Assessment and Plan:
1. IMPAIRED PHYSICAL MOBILITY: The patient has been immobile due to the ICU stay. Physical therapy is recommended to improve mobility.
2. HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM): The patient's sodium levels were elevated, but have since resolved with free water repletion. Monitoring is advised.
3. BACTEREMIA: The patient had bacteremia caused by MRSA and Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas. Treatment includes continuing vancomycin for 14-day course for MRSA coverage and monitoring trough levels in the morning. Amikacin/colistin were discontinued as they were previously used for another Klebsiella pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complicated medical history, including Parkinson's disease, who was admitted after a fall and subsequent subdural hematoma. He had endocarditis and multi-drug resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) caused by Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. The patient presented with fever and altered mental status, and was found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions include impaired physical mobility, hypernatremia (high sodium), bacteremia, chronic respiratory failure, and fever. His recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Kidney function has improved from previous levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. IMPAIRED PHYSICAL MOBILITY: The patient's physical mobility is limited, likely due to his underlying Parkinson's disease and chronic respiratory failure. The plan is to encourage mobility as tolerated.
2. HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM): The patient's high sodium levels have resolved with free water repletion. Monitoring will continue to ensure it does not recur.
3. BACTEREMIA: The patient has bacteremia, which is an infection in the bloodstream. Treatment with vancomycin for MRSA coverage will be continued for a 14-day course. Surveillance cultures will be monitored.

He was admitted with fever and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with impaired physical mobility, hypernatremia (high sodium), bacteremia, respiratory failure, and fever.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/71 mmHg to 136/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.31 and the RSBI is 33.

The patient's physical examination reveals fluctuating mental status, normal heart sounds, symmetric breath sounds with small to moderate secretions, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurologic examination was not assessed due to movement not being assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 98 K/uL, sodium level of 146 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, chloride level of 105 mEq/L, magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 134 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated creatinine, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated lactate, and slightly decreased albumin level.

The patient's plan includes continuing with a 14-day course of MRSA pneumonia treatment, maintaining input/output balance, free water flushes for sodium management, and placement of a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line. The patient is expected to be transferred back to Hospital1 soon, with further plans noted in the resident's note.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of pressure ulcers due to immobility, electrolyte imbalances, infections related to the PICC line or ventilator, and potential bleeding due to the use of LMW heparin for DVT prophylaxis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease and multi-drug resistant pneumonia. He was admitted with fever and altered mental status, and was found to have MRSA pneumonia. The patient continues to grow Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, but is no longer on amikacin and colistin. He has impaired physical mobility, hypernatremia, bacteremia, chronic respiratory failure, and fever. The patient's mental status is approaching baseline, and he is stable on tracheostomy mechanical ventilation. He has eosinophilia due to a history of acute interstitial nephritis from colistin. The plan is to keep his intake and output even and provide free water flushes to lower his sodium level of 146. A percutaneous central catheter (Picc line) was placed today, and the patient will be transferred back to Hospital1 soon. Further plans will be determined by the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently on tracheostomy mechanical ventilation (PMV). There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if there are complications with the ventilation or if the underlying cause of respiratory failure worsens.

2. Infection: The patient has bacteremia and continues to grow Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas despite antibiotic treatment. There is a risk of developing sepsis or experiencing a worsening of the current"

   Assessment and Plan
 67 year-old male with Parkinsons
 disease, complicated medical course
   since [**8-/2168**] after fall and SDH including endocarditis and MDR PNA
   with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas admitted with fever and altered mental
   status; found to have MRSA PNA.
   # MDR PNA:  History of resistant Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas with
   consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
   - ID following; appreciate recs
   - Continue vancomycin for 14-day course for MRSA coverage, picc in
   place.
   - DC amikacin/colistin for previous Amikacin/Klebsiella PNA
   - Discontinued zosyn [**2-4**]
   .
   # Persistent fevers: Now afebrile x 24 hours.  MRSA and
   Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas PNA as above.  No other source identified on
   CT torso [**2-3**]. Patient is now defervescing, borderline temp this
   morning.
   - ID following; appreciate recs
   - Continue Vanco as above
   - No new positive culture data
   - Continue to monitor
   - central line pulled today and sent for culture.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Barriers to continued weaning have been
   secretions from his pna and his altered mental status, both of which
   are slowly improving. Tolerated passy muir valves.  Respiratory
   distress on and off during admission requiring intermittent
   ventilation, likely due to PNA, fluid overload, and component of ICU
   myopathy.
   - Respiratory support with ventilator as needed, otherwise trach mask
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit drop from yesterday without signs or symptoms of
   active bleeding.  Guaiac negative.  Given 1 UPRBC yest.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor
   .
   # Altered mental status: Improved.  Likely toxic/metabolic
   encephalopathy in the setting of infection.  Head CT negative for acute
   processes.  ABG without acute change.
   - Treatment as above
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # CoNS + blood cx bacteremia:
 OSH blood cultures positive from PICC
   line placed last admission
 coagulase negative Staph and presumed
   contaminant.  PICC line discontinued.  TTE this admission with likely
   aortic valve vegetation, similar to prior TTE
 believed unlikely to
   represent new endocarditis.
   - Monitor surveillance cultures
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable and even improving;
   improved from 2.8 last discharge [**1-24**].  Thought to be AIN from
   colistin from last admission, however, improvement on continued
   colistin.  Good urine output.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water repletion.
   - Monitor
   .
   # Parkinson
s disease: No active issues.
   - Continue Sinemet and Ropinirole
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
   - Continue Levothyroxine 88 mcg

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with Parkinson's disease who has been admitted to the ICU since [8/2168] after a fall and subdural hematoma (SDH), including endocarditis and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PNA) with Acinetobacter. He was found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient has had a complicated medical course, including fever and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress due to pneumonia, fluid overload, and ICU myopathy. He requires respiratory support with a ventilator as needed.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped without signs or symptoms of active bleeding. He received a unit of packed red blood cells yesterday and will need further monitoring.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved, likely due to treatment of infection. However, he is still at risk for toxic/metabolic encephalopathy. Continuous monitoring is necessary.
4. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia: The patient had blood cultures positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus from the PICC line placed last admission, which was presumed to be a contaminant. The PICC line has been discontinued.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease and multiple medical complications, including endocarditis and multidrug-resistant pneumonia (MDR PNA) caused by Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas. He was admitted with fever and altered mental status and found to have MRSA pneumonia. The patient has been febrile for several days but is now afebrile. He continues to have respiratory failure due to secretions from his pneumonia and altered mental status. His altered mental status is improving, likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy related to infection. The patient has had an episode of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia from a PICC line, which was discontinued. He also has acute renal failure, which is improving, possibly due to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) from colistin. His hypernatremia has resolved with free water repletion. The patient has Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and diabetes, all of which are being managed with medication. The patient is currently receiving nutritional support and prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is DNR, and his disposition is to rehab. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ongoing pneumonia and secretions.
2. Altered mental status due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy related to infection.
3. Acute renal failure"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and multi-drug resistant (MDR) pneumonia.
- He was admitted with fever and altered mental status, and diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia.
- The patient had a history of chronic colonization and was on GNR coverage, but continued to grow Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas.
- He is currently being treated with a 14-day course of MRSA pneumonia antibiotics until February 11th.
- The patient's TTE shows stable thickened valves, and he has chronic respiratory failure but is stable on tracheostomy mechanical ventilation (TM) with pressure support (PS) at night.
- He is coughing up secretions well and has autoregulated input/output balance.
- The patient has hypernatremia and receives free water flushes.
- A PICC line has been placed, and plans are for the patient to return to rehab soon.
- Further plans are as per the resident note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which is stable on TM with PS. However, there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the current treatment does not effectively manage the underlying condition.

2. MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has MDR pneumonia caused by MRSA. This type of infection can be difficult to treat, and there is a risk of treatment failure or development of antibiotic resistance.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of Parkinson's disease and multi-drug resistant (MDR) pneumonia. He was admitted with a fever and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and was on GNR coverage for chronic colonization, but continues to grow Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. He is currently off amikacin and colistin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/69 mmHg to 135/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination revealed near baseline mental status, normal cardiovascular findings, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds with small to moderate secretions, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurological examination was not assessed due to movement not being assessed.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 229 K/uL, sodium of 146 mg/dL, potassium of 4.3 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, glucose of 162 mg/dL, and white blood cell count ranging from 9.3 to 11.0 K"
