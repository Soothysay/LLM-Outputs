   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 28-year-old gentleman with
   # Abdominal pain and abnormal LFTs:
   DDx includes cholangitis secondary to gallstone, biliary obstruction
   from malignancy (note that patient has had 40 pound weight loss
   recently), or necrotizing pancreatitis.  Gallstone seems to be the most
   likely explanation given clear evidence of cholecystitis and rapid
   improvement in pancreatic enzymes following cholecystectomy.  Other
   possible causes of pancreatitis include alcohol use or
   hypertriglyceridemia, again less likely given evidence of stones.  Pt
   denies recent heavy drinking.  He currently has no signs of septic
   physiology.
   - appreciate surgical input about possibility of necrotizing
   pancreatitis and for thoughts about ileus
   - ERCP aware of patient and will likely take to ERCP in AM
   - check CVP to determine need for IVF
   - monitor urine output and blood pressure
   - continue unasyn started at OSH; if patient deteriorates, would
   consider covering resistant enterococci
   - check triglycerides
   - treat pain with dilaudid
   - f/u Cx here and at [**Last Name (un) 2491**]
   # Ileus:
   Possible causes include pancreatitis, gallstone ileus, hypokalemia,
   obstruction, or post-operative ileus.  He is not vomiting and abdominal
   exam is reassuring.
   - monitor and replete lytes
   - monitor abdominal exam
   - NPO
   - appreciate surgical input
   # Tachypnea:
   Likely due to abdominal discomfort.  Also has restrictive lung disease
   from his obesity.  Pain may also be a contributor.
   - pain control as above
   # Hypertension:
   Suspect patient may have undiagnosed HTN that has been worsened by
   volume overload.
   - gentle labetalol to SBP > 180
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Stable since admission.  [**Month (only) 8**] be due to acute illness, med side effect,
   or low baseline.
   - monitor
   # Coagulopathy:
   Likely due to vitamin K deficiency from poor nutrition and recent
   antibiotics.
   - vitamin K IV x 1 and recheck coags
   # Leukocytosis and fevers:  likely from cholangitis and ileus
   - monitor
   # FEN:  NPO with IVF as needed for low Uop or low CVP
   # PPX:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -No bowel regimen for now given NPO; will need bowel meds given
   dilaudid use
   -Pain management with dilaudid PCA
   # ACCESS: PIV's and subclavian (placed at OSH and will likely need to
   be dc'd in AM
   # CODE STATUS:  Confirmed FULL
   # EMERGENCY CONTACT:  wife [**Name (NI) 183**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10699**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with abdominal pain and jaundice. He has a history of recent weight loss. The patient was transferred from another hospital for possible cholangitis and ERCP. He continues to experience abdominal pain, rising bilirubin levels, and has not had a bowel movement or passed flatus. He is scheduled for a CT scan of the abdomen today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and jaundice may indicate cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated pancreatic enzymes suggest pancreatitis. If severe, it can progress to necrotizing pancreatitis, leading to local and systemic complications.
3. Ileus: The patient's lack of bowel movement and abdominal distension could be indicative of ileus, which is a temporary paralysis of the intestines. This can lead to complications such as bowel perforation or infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently on the lower side, indicating potential hypotension. If not addressed, it can result in inadequate organ perfusion and organ damage.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PT/INR and low platelet count, suggesting a coagulation disorder. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Infection:"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 28-year-old gentleman with recent lap chole for gallstone
   pancreatitis, now admitted with likely cholangitis
   # Abdominal pain and abnormal LFTs:  Most likely ascending cholangitis
   from biliary obstruction.  Other causes include surgical trauma (i.e.
   nicked CBD) from recent surgery, necrotizing pancreatitis, alcoholic
   pancreatitis (though patient denies excessive drinking), malignancy
   (recent 40 pound weight loss), or hypertriglyceridemia.  Most likely
   cause is cholangitis in setting of residual stone however, a normal
   intraoperative cholangiogram makes this diagnosis somewhat atypical.
   (Patient has signs of Charcot
s Triad, but not [**Last Name (un) 4043**]
s Pentad).
   - CT abdomen and pelvis today
   - appreciate surgical input; will touch base once patient has CT
   - ERCP aware of patient and will likely take patient today
   - monitor urine output and blood pressure
   - continue unasyn started at OSH; if patient deteriorates, would
   consider covering resistant enterococci

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain and jaundice. He has a history of recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's condition has not improved, with persistent abdominal pain, rising bilirubin levels, and lack of bowel movement or flatus. He is currently undergoing a CT abdomen and has been transferred from another hospital for possible cholangitis and ERCP. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypertension, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. His lab results indicate abnormal liver function tests, elevated white blood cell count, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is also experiencing ileus, tachypnea, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, leukocytosis, and fever. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ascending cholangitis due to biliary obstruction.
2. Surgical trauma (i.e., nicked CBD) from recent surgery.
3. Necrotizing pancreatitis.
4. Alcoholic pancreatitis (though the patient denies excessive drinking).
5. Malignancy (recent 40-pound weight loss).
6. Hypertriglyceridemia.
7. Intrabdominal infection.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.
9. Stress ulcer prophylaxis.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 28-year-old gentleman with recent lap chole for gallstone
   pancreatitis, now admitted with likely cholangitis
   # Abdominal pain and abnormal LFTs:  Most likely ascending cholangitis
   from biliary obstruction.  Other causes include surgical trauma (i.e.
   nicked CBD) from recent surgery, necrotizing pancreatitis, alcoholic
   pancreatitis (though patient denies excessive drinking), malignancy
   (recent 40 pound weight loss), or hypertriglyceridemia.
   - CT abdomen and pelvis today
   - appreciate surgical input; will touch base once patient has CT
   - ERCP aware of patient and will likely take patient today
   - monitor urine output and blood pressure
   - continue unasyn started at OSH; if patient deteriorates, would
   consider covering resistant enterococci
   - treat pain with dilaudid PCA (no basal for now as patient got
   delirious on high doses of dilaudid at OSH)
   - f/u Cx here and at [**Last Name (un) 2491**]
   # Ileus:
   Most likely from continuous narcotics that patient was receiving at
   outside hospital.
   - Continue bowel regimen
   - Replete lytes
   - monitor abdominal exam
   - NPO
   - appreciate surgical input
   # Tachypnea:
   Likely due to abdominal discomfort (patient doesn
t want to expand
   lungs fully) and pain
   - Encourage adequate and deep respirations
   - Pain control as above
   # Hypertension:
   Most likely multifactorial from volume overload, pain, and underlying
   hypertension.  (Patient was actually told that he had high BP some
   years ago, but was able to manage BP with diet and weight loss)
   - Labetalol to SBP > 180.  Will initiate more aggressive control after

   This is a 28-year-old gentleman with recent lap chole for gallstone
   pancreatitis, now admitted with likely cholangitis
   # Abdominal pain and abnormal LFTs:  CT shows necrotizing pancreatitis
   without pseudocyst or SBO, as well as intra and extra hepatic ductal
   dilation. Surgery team still concerned that CBD was nicked during lap
   chole. ERCP team rec conservative treatment until acute inflammation
   subsides. WBC continues to rise daily. Blood cx neg.
   - continue zosyn
   - treat pain with dilaudid PCA (no basal for now as patient got
   delirious on high doses of dilaudid at OSH)

   # Ileus: No SBO on CT. Now having diarrhea
   - Replete lytes
   - monitor abdominal exam
   - NPO, TPN
   - appreciate surgical input
   # Tachypnea:
   Likely due to abdominal discomfort (patient doesn

   - Encourage adequate and deep respirations, IS
   - Pain control as above
   # Hypertension:
   Most likely multifactorial from volume overload, pain, and underlying
   hypertension.  (Patient was actually told that he had high BP some
   years ago, but was able to manage BP with diet and weight loss).
   - attempt PO labetalol

","The patient is a 28-year-old male with recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis. He was admitted with likely cholangitis and has been diagnosed with necrotizing pancreatitis without pseudocyst or small bowel obstruction (SBO), as well as intra and extrahepatic ductal dilation. The surgical team is concerned that the common bile duct (CBD) was nicked during the laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The ERCP team recommends conservative treatment until acute inflammation subsides. The patient's white blood cell count continues to rise daily, and blood cultures are negative.

The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which is likely due to ileus. He has no small bowel obstruction on CT scan. His electrolytes are replete, and he is being monitored for an abdominal exam. He is on nothing by mouth (NPO) with total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient is also experiencing tachypnea, likely due to abdominal discomfort and pain. His chest X-ray is clear, and he is spitting up small amounts of whitish blood tinged sputum. He is encouraged to take adequate and deep respirations, and pain control is being provided.

The patient has hypertension, which is most likely multifactorial from volume overload, pain, and underlying hypertension. He is being given oral labetalol and intravenous hydralazine as needed.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, which has been stable since"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo male s/p lab CCY with post operative course complicated by
   persistent fever, sepsis felt to be secondary to possible pancreatitis
   or CBD insult.  He has had improvement in fever but with persistent WBC
   count elevation and T. Bili elevation with amylase/lipase only mildly
   elevated at this time but CT showing significant destructive
   pancreatitis with concern for necrosis and significant insult present.
   1) Pancreatitis-With necrosis seen on CT scan per radiology report and
   with diffuse insult seen with edema upon review
   -Would continue empiric broad spectrum antibiotics with Imipenem
   reasonable when coverage narrowed based upon culture results.
   -We do see intra and extrahepatic ductal dilitation which may be
   related to pancreatic head changes in the setting of signficiant edema
   -We do see some significant improvement in patients subjective pain
   improving
   -Will continue with TPN and NPO status
   -Dilaudid PCA in place
   -Blood cultures negative at outset and now
   -Will send C. Diff to be complete
   2)S/P Cholecystectomy-
   -Will send sputum
   -Will need incentive spirometry
   -Will get patient OOB as possible today
   -We do have question raised as to possible biliarly system leak and in
   the setting of improving abdominal exam would favor continued
   supportive care at this time but will continue to consult with ERCP for
   timing of any intervention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male who underwent a cholecystectomy and is now experiencing persistent fever, sepsis, and signs of pancreatitis with necrosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/84 to 195/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems reveals fatigue and constitutional symptoms. Physical examination shows an overweight/obese appearance, distant heart sounds, diminished breath sounds, and soft non-tender abdomen. The patient is attentive and follows simple commands, but movement and tone assessments are not performed. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 15.8 to 21.6 thousand cells per microliter, elevated total bilirubin, and mildly elevated amylase and lipase levels. Imaging shows significant destructive pancreatitis with concern for necrosis and edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis with necrosis: This condition can lead to further inflammation, infection, and potential organ failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate an ongoing infection, which could progress to septic shock if not effectively managed.
3. Biliary system leak: The intra and extrahepatic ductal dilation seen on imaging raises"
