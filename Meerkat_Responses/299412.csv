   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with ALL s/p chemo and recent VRE bacteremia with VRE CNS
   infection with multiple admissions to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] who is now being transferred
   to ICU s/p hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: In setting of severe anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis. ABG on BMT floor with PaO2 86 but then subsequently dropped
   O2 sats to 70% on NRB requiring intubation. Unclear precipitant but may
   have many contributing factors including possible worsening pulmonary
   edema in setting of cardiogenic shock, worsening sepsis. [**Month (only) 11**] have also
   tired as pt very tachypneic due to metabolic AG acidosis; but never
   developed hypercarbia, arguing against this.  Lactate improving today.
   Still on levo.
   - Will eventually need IV diuresis with lasix, if hemodynamics improve
   - Can try to follow CVPs on femoral line.
   - Obtain TTE results
   - if needed will start dobutamine gtt for possible cardiogenic shock
   - Cover broadly with linezolid, acyclovir, atovaquone, and now
   meropenem
   - Sputum for cx
   - adjust vent settings to decrease RR today, and try to reduce FIO2
   today
   .
   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever
   or luekocytosis to suggest infection. However, cannot entirely rule out
   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line.  Also has Klebsiella in sputum, was
   thought to be colonization. Has significant evidence of hypoperfusion
   as has low urine output and very elevated lactate. Hypotension may also
   be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or septic shock would be more
   likely diagnostic considerations.
   - Continue levophed gtt and start dobutamine gtt for treatment of
   likely cardiogenic shock if needed (has hx of arrthymias on dobutamine,
   so may need milirone)
   - if starting dobutamine may need femeral a-line to monitor BP
   - will try to replace central line with right sided line
   - monitor UO
   - TTE in am to assess LVEF and r/o RV overload.
   - Hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - Empiric IV abx coverage with linezolid, meropenem, acylclovir,
   atovaquone.
   - Bld cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: With initially some compensation from
   respiratory alkalosis. AG acidosis [**1-1**] significantly elevated lactate
   in setting of global decreased perfusion. Elevated lactate may also be
   exacerbated by use of IV linezolid; however, given recent daptomycin
   resistance in VRE strains on BMT floor, would favor keeping on
   linezolid for now. Lactate now improving, and Ph improved with bicarb
   - Follow serial lactates. If remains elevated, may need to change
   linezolid to prevent mitochondiral damage
   - Levophed for now and PRN dobutamine
   - Attempt to maintain MAP > 65
   - will give thiamine
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: [**1-1**] increased cell death from elevated lactate and
   metabolic acidosis is also contributing to extracellular hyperkalemia.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be sign of developing renal failure, but for now Cr is still
   wnl.  Now improved.
   - monitor lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy - INR rising although plts relatively stable over past
   24 hours.
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   .
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and still has
   indwelling femoral TLC. Recent LP reassuring.
   - f/u repeat blood, urine cxs.
   - No role for repeat LP at this point as recent LP reassuring.
   - Needs 4 week course of linezolid since Omaya removed ([**4-16**]).
   - Appreciate ID following.
   -discuss line change
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Felt to be due to SIADH. Is improved from prior.
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - although recent renal recs suggest lasix rather than salt tabs, will
   be mindful of blood pressure prior to giving any lasix doses
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # ALL: Not currently receiving active treatment. Prognosis poor.
   - appreciate oncology input
   - acyclovir and atovaquone for PPx
   .
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25
   - monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to marrow suppression after recent
   chemotherapy.
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF newly depressed at
   20%, possibly due to her chemotherapy.  Total body volume overloaded,
   but will hold off on diuresis given hypotension as above.
   - Mgmt of posible cardiogenic shock as above.
   -TTE today
   .
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN:  Will need OGT/NGT placement for po meds, starting tube feeds.
   .
   # Access:  Femoral line placed by IR [**4-12**], will try to change line
   other side today
   .
   # PPx:  famotidine, subQ heparin (at [**Hospital1 **] given recent increase in PTT)
   .
   # Comm:  son [**Name (NI) 6306**] aware of transfer to ICU
   .
   # Code:  per son [**Name (NI) 6306**]/HCP, would only pursue 30-60 sec of CPR. D/w ICU
   attg, made CPR not indicated beyond 30-60sec
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU pending further work-up
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis and required intubation due to low oxygen saturation. There may be contributing factors such as worsening pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension could be due to cardiogenic causes, especially considering the presence of cold extremities, lack of fever or leukocytosis suggesting infection, and elevated lactate levels indicating poor tissue perfusion.

3. Septic shock: Although less likely than cardiogenic shock, the patient's recent high-grade VRE bacteremia and indwelling femoral line increase the risk of septic shock.

4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has significantly elevated lactate levels, which may be exacerbated by the use of IV linezolid. This could lead to further acidosis and worsening of the patient's condition.

5. Hyperkalemia: Elevated potassium levels may be a result of increased cell death from elevated lactate and metabolic acidosis, as well as potential developing renal failure.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is rising, indicating a bleeding risk, although platelet levels are relatively stable.

7. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Although cultures have not shown any growth since April 12th, the patient had a"

   Assessment and Plan
   60yo woman with ALL s/p chemo and recent VRE bacteremia with VRE CNS
   infection with multiple admissions to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] who is now being transferred
   to ICU s/p hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: In setting of severe anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis. ABG on BMT floor with PaO2 86 but then subsequently dropped
   O2 sats to 70% on NRB requiring intubation. Unclear precipitant but may
   have many contributing factors including possible worsening pulmonary
   edema in setting of cardiogenic shock, worsening sepsis. [**Month (only) 11**] have also
   tired as pt very tachypneic due to metabolic AG acidosis; but never
   developed hypercarbia, arguing against this.
   - Will likely need aline and is very hard stick. Will retry once
   rewarmed with baerhugger. Apparently has needed axillary aline before.
   - Will eventually need IV diuresis with lasix. Given recent hypotension
   with elevated lactate to 14.4 and pressor requirement, will favor
   holding off for now. If hemodynamics improve, will start diuresis in
   AM.
   - Can try to follow CVPs on femoral line.
   - Obtain TTE.
   - Start dobutamine gtt for possible cardiogenic shock --> pulm edema
   --> hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - Cover broadly with linezolid, acyclovir, atovaquone. Adding
   meropenem.
   .
   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever
   or luekocytosis to suggest infection. However, cannot entirely rule out
   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line. Has significant evidence of
   hypoperfusion as has low urine output and very elevated lactate.
   Hypotension may also be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or
   septic shock would be more likely diagnostic considerations.
   - Continue levophed gtt and start dobutamine gtt for treatment of
   likely cardiogenic shock.
   - TTE in am to assess LVEF and r/o RV overload.
   - Hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - IVF boluses (although evidence of pulm edema) to bump pt up on her
   Starling curve.
   - Empiric IV abx coverage with linezolid, meropenem, acylclovir,
   atovaquone.
   - Bld cxs, UA, urine cx.
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: With initially some compensation from
   respiratory alkalosis. AG acidosis [**1-1**] significantly elevated lactate
   in setting of global decreased perfusion. Elevated lactate may also be
   exacerbated by use of IV linezolid; however, given recent daptomycin
   resistance in VRE strains on BMT floor, would favor keeping on
   linezolid for now.
   - Follow serial lactates. If remains elevated, doubt that pt would make
   any meaningful recovery and will rediscuss with son.
   - Levophed, dobutamine, IVFs as above to increase perfusion.
   - s/p 1 amp HCO3 and getting 3 additional amps of HCO3 with D5W now.
   - Follow serial pH and give HCO3 for pH < 7.2
   - Attempt to maintain MAP > 65.
   - maintain MAP > 65
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: [**1-1**] increased cell death from elevated lactate and
   metabolic acidosis is also contributing to extracellular hyperkalemia.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be sign of developing renal failure, but for now Cr is still
   wnl.
   - s/p HCO3 amps as above.
   - Give PR kayexalate.
   - Consider IV calcium for cardiac stabilization, thus far no
   significant hyperkalemic cardiac changes on telemetry.
   - Check EKG.
   .
   # Coagulopathy - INR rising although plts relatively stable over past
   24 hours.
   - Check DIC labs.
   - If fibrinogen low, will transfuse with cryoprecipitate and hold on
   plt transfusions.
   - Monitor INR.
   .
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and still has
   indwelling femoral TLC. Recent LP reassuring.
   - f/u repeat blood, urine cxs.
   - No role for repeat LP at this point as recent LP reassuring.
   - Needs 4 week course of linezolid since Omaya removed ([**4-16**]).
   - Appreciate ID following.
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Felt to be due to SIADH. Is improved from prior.
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - although recent renal recs suggest lasix rather than salt tabs, will
   be mindful of blood pressure prior to giving any lasix doses
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # ALL: Not currently receiving active treatment. Prognosis poor.
   - appreciate oncology input
   - acyclovir and atovaquone for PPx
   .
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - active type and screen
   - monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to marrow suppression after recent
   chemotherapy.
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF newly depressed at
   20%, possibly due to her chemotherapy.  Total body volume overloaded,
   but will hold off on diuresis given hypotension as above.
   - Mgmt of posible cardiogenic shock as above.
   .
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN:  Will need OGT/NGT placement for po meds, starting tube feeds.
   .
   # Access:  Femoral line placed by IR [**4-12**]
   .
   # PPx:  famotidine, subQ heparin (at [**Hospital1 **] given recent increase in PTT)
   .
   # Comm:  son [**Name (NI) 6306**] aware of transfer to ICU
   .
   # Code:  per son [**Name (NI) 6306**]/HCP, would only pursue 30-60 sec of CPR. D/w ICU
   attg, made CPR not indicated
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU pending further work-up
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a background of multiple admissions and a recent VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, coagulopathy, VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, anxiety, possible asthma, hypothyroidism, and feeding intolerance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to cardiogenic or septic shock. There is evidence of hypoperfusion, including low urine output and elevated lactate levels. The patient requires continuous monitoring and treatment for suspected cardiogenic shock, including the use of dobutamine and IV fluids.

2. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has significantly elevated lactate levels, indicating poor tissue perfusion. The acidosis may be exacerbated by the use of IV linezolid. Serial lactate measurements should be followed, and if elevated, the patient may not make a meaningful recovery. Treatment options include increasing perfusion with levophed and dobutamine, administering HCO3, and maintaining a MAP > 65.

3. Hyperkalemia: Elevated potassium levels may be a result of"

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] in the setting of likely
   shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic (infxn).
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - mechanical ventilation
 wean
   - consider dobutamine gtt for MAP < 60
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, acyclovir
   - , and try to reduce FIO2 today
   a.       Wean  Fio2 first and then can later can consider go down on
   PEEP
   .
   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever
   or luekocytosis to suggest infection. However, cannot entirely rule out
   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line.  Also has Klebsiella in sputum, was
   thought to be colonization. Has significant evidence of hypoperfusion
   as has low urine output and very elevated lactate. Hypotension may also
   be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or septic shock would be more
   likely diagnostic considerations.
   - Continue levophed gtt and start dobutamine gtt for treatment of
   likely cardiogenic shock if needed (has hx of arrthymias on dobutamine,
   so may need milirone)
   - if starting dobutamine may need femeral a-line to monitor BP
   - will try to replace central line with right sided line
   - monitor UO
   - TTE in am to assess LVEF and r/o RV overload.
   - Hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - Empiric IV abx coverage with linezolid, meropenem, acylclovir,
   atovaquone.
   - Bld cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: With initially some compensation from
   respiratory alkalosis. AG acidosis [**1-1**] significantly elevated lactate
   in setting of global decreased perfusion. Elevated lactate may also be
   exacerbated by use of IV linezolid; however, given recent daptomycin
   resistance in VRE strains on BMT floor, would favor keeping on
   linezolid for now. Lactate now improving, and Ph improved with bicarb
   - Follow serial lactates. If remains elevated, may need to change
   linezolid to prevent mitochondiral damage
   - Levophed for now and PRN dobutamine
   - Attempt to maintain MAP > 65
   - will give thiamine
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: [**1-1**] increased cell death from elevated lactate and
   metabolic acidosis is also contributing to extracellular hyperkalemia.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be sign of developing renal failure, but for now Cr is still
   wnl.  Now improved.
   - monitor lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy - INR rising although plts relatively stable over past
   24 hours.
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   .
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and still has
   indwelling femoral TLC. Recent LP reassuring.
   - f/u repeat blood, urine cxs.
   - No role for repeat LP at this point as recent LP reassuring.
   - Needs 4 week course of linezolid since Omaya removed ([**4-16**]).
   - Appreciate ID following.
   -discuss line change
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Felt to be due to SIADH. Is improved from prior.
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - although recent renal recs suggest lasix rather than salt tabs, will
   be mindful of blood pressure prior to giving any lasix doses
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25
   - monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to marrow suppression after recent
   chemotherapy.
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF newly depressed at
   20%, possibly due to her chemotherapy.  Total body volume overloaded,
   but will hold off on diuresis given hypotension as above.
   - Mgmt of posible cardiogenic shock as above.
   -TTE today
   .
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.
   # Comm:  son [**Name (NI) 6306**] aware of transfer to ICU

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) status post allogeneic non-related stem cell transplantation (SCT), donor lymphocyte infusion, and chemotherapy. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has been admitted multiple times due to VRE bacteremia with central nervous system involvement. She is now on broad antimicrobial coverage including meropenem, daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, and acyclovir. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, hypotension, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, coagulopathy, VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, anxiety, possible asthma, hypothyroidism, and code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to cardiogenic cause or septic shock due to infection.
2. Development of further respiratory failure.
3. Persistent hypotension and low urine output, which may indicate poor organ perfusion.
4. Continued elevation of lactate levels, indicating possible mitochondrial damage.
5. Development of renal failure indicated by rising creatinine levels.
6. Coagulopathy and potential bleeding complications due to elevated INR.
7. Recurrence of VRE bacteremia or infection.
8. Poor glycemic control and potential"

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: In setting of severe anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis. ABG on BMT floor with PaO2 86 but then subsequently dropped
   O2 sats to 70% on NRB requiring intubation. Unclear precipitant but may
   have many contributing factors including possible worsening pulmonary
   edema in setting of cardiogenic shock, worsening sepsis. [**Month (only) 11**] have also
   tired as pt very tachypneic due to metabolic AG acidosis; but never
   developed hypercarbia, arguing against this.  Lactate improving today.
   Still on levo.
   - Will eventually need IV diuresis with lasix, if hemodynamics improve
   - Can try to follow CVPs on femoral line.
   - Obtain TTE results
   - if needed will start dobutamine gtt for possible cardiogenic shock
   - Cover broadly with linezolid, acyclovir, atovaquone, and now
   meropenem
   - Sputum for cx
   - adjust vent settings to decrease RR today, and try to reduce FIO2
   today
   .
   # Hypotension: Main considerations here are cardiogenic vs infectious
   causes of hypotension. Mostly strongly suspect cardiogenic cause as pt
   very cold, clamped down on arrival to unit. Also has not had a  fever
   or luekocytosis to suggest infection. However, cannot entirely rule out
   septic cause in this pt with recent high grade VRE bacteremia in
   setting of indwelling femoral line.  Also has Klebsiella in sputum, was
   thought to be colonization. Has significant evidence of hypoperfusion
   as has low urine output and very elevated lactate. Hypotension may also
   be [**1-1**] PE; however, feel that cardiogenic or septic shock would be more
   likely diagnostic considerations.
   - Continue levophed gtt and start dobutamine gtt for treatment of
   likely cardiogenic shock if needed (has hx of arrthymias on dobutamine,
   so may need milirone)
   - if starting dobutamine may need femeral a-line to monitor BP
   - will try to replace central line with right sided line
   - monitor UO
   - TTE in am to assess LVEF and r/o RV overload.
   - Hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - Empiric IV abx coverage with linezolid, meropenem, acylclovir,
   atovaquone.
   - Bld cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: With initially some compensation from
   respiratory alkalosis. AG acidosis [**1-1**] significantly elevated lactate
   in setting of global decreased perfusion. Elevated lactate may also be
   exacerbated by use of IV linezolid; however, given recent daptomycin
   resistance in VRE strains on BMT floor, would favor keeping on
   linezolid for now. Lactate now improving, and Ph improved with bicarb
   - Follow serial lactates. If remains elevated, may need to change
   linezolid to prevent mitochondiral damage
   - Levophed for now and PRN dobutamine
   - Attempt to maintain MAP > 65
   - will give thiamine
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: [**1-1**] increased cell death from elevated lactate and
   metabolic acidosis is also contributing to extracellular hyperkalemia.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be sign of developing renal failure, but for now Cr is still
   wnl.  Now improved.
   - monitor lytes
   .
   # Coagulopathy - INR rising although plts relatively stable over past
   24 hours.
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   .
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and still has
   indwelling femoral TLC. Recent LP reassuring.
   - f/u repeat blood, urine cxs.
   - No role for repeat LP at this point as recent LP reassuring.
   - Needs 4 week course of linezolid since Omaya removed ([**4-16**]).
   - Appreciate ID following.
   -discuss line change
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Felt to be due to SIADH. Is improved from prior.
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - although recent renal recs suggest lasix rather than salt tabs, will
   be mindful of blood pressure prior to giving any lasix doses
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Anemia:  Stable.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25
   - monitor
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to marrow suppression after recent
   chemotherapy.
   - monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Recent EF newly depressed at
   20%, possibly due to her chemotherapy.  Total body volume overloaded,
   but will hold off on diuresis given hypotension as above.
   - Mgmt of posible cardiogenic shock as above.
   -TTE today
   .
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ALL who underwent a transplant, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is now admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a prolonged hospitalization due to VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. Her current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypotension, hyperkalemia, coagulopathy, hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, anxiety, asthma, hypothyroidism, and septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ICU stay: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and multiple comorbidities increase the risk of a prolonged ICU stay.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires mechanical ventilation support, which carries risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, and oxygen toxicity.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement and is currently showing signs of septic shock. This increases the risk of further sepsis-related complications.
4. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has evidence of cardiogenic shock, which may require advanced cardiac support measures such as dobutamine infusion or intra-aortic balloon pump placement.
5. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis can lead to complications such as arrhythmias"

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn).
   - mechanical ventilation
 wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic. Cardiogenic shock in the
   setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF 25% on
   TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w possible
   sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p R
   femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.
   - norepinephrine gtt, wean as tolerated
   - consider dobutamine/milrinone gtt if MAP < 60
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP
   - hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable.
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Resolving with improved tissue
   perfusion. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - thiamine IV as poor PO absorption
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs

   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (2 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   .
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone a stem cell transplant and chemotherapy. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has been intubated. She has a prolonged hospitalization and is now presenting with hypotension and shock, possibly due to cardiogenic or septic causes. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including severe acute on chronic congestive heart failure, anasarca, anemia, thrombocytopenia, anxiety, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which could lead to complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Hypotension and Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and shock, possibly due to cardiogenic or septic causes. This puts her at risk for organ hypoperfusion and potential multi-organ dysfunction.

3. VRE Bacteremia with CNS Involvement: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. There is a risk of recurrence or progression of infection, especially if appropriate antimicrobial coverage is not maintained.

4. Anion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has had episodes of anion-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to tissue hypoperfusion in the"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent an allogeneic non-related stem cell transplantation (SCT), chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has a complicated medical history including prolonged hospitalization, multiple admissions, VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, cardiogenic and septic shock, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, abnormal potassium levels, hyponatremia, coagulopathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, anxiety, asthma, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to acute respiratory distress, likely from shock (cardiogenic or septic). Mechanical ventilation is ongoing, and weaning of PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated is planned.
2. Hypotension/shock: Cardiogenic vs septic shock is suspected, with the possibility of sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection, and Klebsiella pneumonia.
3. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: This condition is likely due to tissue hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension/shock, but it could also be caused by linezolid side effects or thiamine deficiency.
4. Abnormal potassium levels: Hypo/hyperkalemia may occur in the setting"

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn).
   - mechanical ventilation
 decrease PS, daily SBTs
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**].
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP, if less will try dobutamine
   - hold on diuresis for now until pt more HD stable
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   Resolved.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with
   latex)
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis. AM of [**5-8**]- 2.5.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will be given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who has undergone a bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has a prolonged hospitalization due to VRE bacteremia with central nervous system involvement. 

The patient's recent events include weaning off norepinephrine and midazolam, reduction in ventilator support, and attempted extubation on 05/09. 

Medical allergies include sulfa, penicillins, latex, red dye, Darvon, Percodan, aspirin, fentanyl, and aspartame. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 36.4-36.6°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure range of 105/70-133/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,833 mL and output of 1,025 mL since midnight. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 30%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone transplantation, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has a prolonged hospitalization. The patient has multiple medical complications including VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, cardiogenic and septic shock, hyponatremia, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, abnormal potassium levels, anemia, thrombocytopenia, anxiety, asthma, and hypothyroidism. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PSV mode.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VRE Bacteremia with CNS Involvement: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. This condition requires ongoing monitoring and treatment with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and low urine output suggest the possibility of cardiogenic and septic shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamics, fluid balance, and organ perfusion is necessary. Immediate intervention may be required to stabilize the patient's condition.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia. This can lead to various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and muscle weakness. Fluid restriction and careful monitoring of sodium levels are recommended.
4. Anion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's blood pH is below normal, indicating"

   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**]. Improving CO/CI.
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent an allogeneic non-related stem cell transplant (SCT), chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She has been hospitalized for a prolonged period and is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. She has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, multiple hospital admissions, cardiogenic and septic shock, and various other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory distress likely from shock (cardiogenic or septic) or both. She requires mechanical ventilation and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is planned.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient may be experiencing cardiogenic or septic shock, or both. Cardiogenic shock could be due to severe acute on chronic CHF, low ejection fraction (LVEF 25%), total body volume overload, and poor perfusion. Septic shock may be caused by prior VRE infection, VRE line infection, or Klebsiella pneumonia.

3. VRE Bacteremia with CNS Involvement: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, despite the removal of an Omaya and left femoral venous TLC. She is currently being treated with daptomycin.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient likely has syndrome of inappropriate ant"

   Assessment and Plan
   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: Intubated on [**5-6**] due to respiratory
   distress likely from shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic
   (infxn). RSBI 127
   - mechanical ventilation
 try PS again if pt more awake
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (see below)
   # Hypotension/Shock: Cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock
   in the setting of severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF
   25% on TTE [**5-7**]. Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w
   possible sources including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p
   R femoral venous TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum
   cxs growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Elevated lactate and low UOP in
   the setting of poor perfusion. No clinical sxs/ss of infection,
   however, given h/o prior infections and chronic illness, still high
   risk.  Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**]. Improving CO/CI.
   - continue broad antimicrobial coverage: meropenem, daptomycin,
   ciprofloxacin, atovaqone, acyclovir
   - monitor UOP, if less will try dobutamine
   - monitor CO, CI and hemodynamics
   - f/u bl cxs, UA, urine cx, sputum cx
   - consider lasix diuresis to goal of -1-2 L per 24 hrs
   # VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Nothing growing on cultures
   since [**4-12**]; however, infected Omaya removed on [**4-16**] and indwelling left
   femoral venous TLC removed on [**5-7**]. S/p linezolid, now switched to
   daptomycin.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - d/w ID daptomycin course (possibly 4 wks post femoral line removal)
   - ID recs
   # Hyponatremia: likely [**1-1**] SIADH, improved from prior
   - fluid restriction to 1L.
   - monitor serial Na
   - consider salt tabs
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate 2.2, anion gap is normal. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.
   Resolved.
   - continue to monitor lactate levels
   - PO thiamine (IV was held off due to possible contamination with
   latex)
   # Abnormal potassium (Hypo/Hyperkalemia): Likely in the setting of
   acidosis/alkalosis. AM of [**5-8**]- 2.5.
   - monitor and replete as needed
   .
   # ALL: s/p allo non-related SCT ([**2169**]), s/p donor lymphocyte infusion,
   s/p chemotherapy. No current therapy indicated. Poor prognosis.
   - BMT recs
   # Coagulopathy:  elevated INR
   - monitor coags and hct in PM with repeat fibrinogen
   - will be given FFP for procedures
   - Monitor INR.
   # Anemia:  [**1-1**] chemo, malignancy and acute blood loss from procedures.
   - active type and screen
   - trasfuse for <25 (1 pRBCs today)
   - monitor Hct in PM
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-1**] chemo and malignancy
   - monitor PLT levels
   - transfuse for < 20
   # Anxiety: Has been a significant component of pt's presentation,
   although doubtful that anxiety was related to pt's tachypnea as she was
   likely compensating for worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis. Stable.
   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  On IV levothyroxine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent an allogeneic non-related stem cell transplant (SCT), chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has a prolonged hospitalization due to VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. The patient has multiple comorbidities including cardiogenic and septic shock, severe acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), anemia, thrombocytopenia, anxiety, asthma, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory distress likely from shock - cardiogenic or septic. Mechanical ventilation is being provided, and the patient is expected to try pressure support ventilation (PSV) if more awake.
2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic vs septic shock or both. Cardiogenic shock is due to severe acute on chronic CHF with LVEF 25%. Sepsis may be caused by prior VRE infection, VRE line infection, or Klebsiella pneumonia. Elevated lactate and low urine output indicate poor perfusion. A new line placement has been done, and cardiac output and cardiac index are improving.
3. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Although nothing grew on cultures since 4/12, an infected Omaya was removed on"

   60F w ALL s/p transplant, chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion,
   now w prolonged hospitalization c/b VRE bacteremia w CNS involvement,
   multiple [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] admissions, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure.
   # Acute respiratory failure: extubated [**5-11**]. likely [**1-1**] shock -
   cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w LVEF 25%) vs septic (infxn).
   - monitor respiratory status
   - check ABG
   - O2 by face mask, wean as tolerated
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (see below)
   # Hypotension/Shock: Blood pressure currently stable. Etiology
   cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock in the setting of
   severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF 25% on TTE [**5-7**].
   Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w possible sources
   including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (s/p R femoral venous
   TLC removal on [**5-7**]), Klebsiella PNA ([**4-26**], [**4-29**] sputum cxs growing
   pan-sensitive Klebsiella). Now s/p new line placement [**5-7**].

   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  will start IV levothyroxine if unable to take tube
   feeds.
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate stable ~2. Linezolid switched to daptomycin.  Resolved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone a transplant, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has had multiple hospital admissions.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient was extubated on 5/11 and is likely experiencing cardiogenic (with an ejection fraction of 25% on TTE) vs septic (infection) shock. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and ABG should be checked. Oxygen delivery through a face mask should be weaned as tolerated, and treatment for possible cardiogenic and septic shock should be provided.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but the etiology of the hypotension is uncertain, with cardiogenic, septic, or both possibilities. Cardiogenic shock could be due to severe acute on chronic CHF, low ejection fraction (25%), and chemotherapy. Sepsis may have multiple sources, including prior VRE infection, VRE line infection, and Klebsiella pneumonia. Broad antimicrobial coverage should continue, and the patient's UOP, bl cxs, UA, urine cx, and sputum cx should be monitored.

3. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: The patient has had no positive cultures"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone a transplant, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has a history of prolonged hospitalization due to VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. The patient's medical complications include acute respiratory failure, hypotension/shock (cardiogenic vs septic), VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, hyponatremia (likely SIADH), anemia, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, anxiety, possible asthma, hypothyroidism, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, indicating a potentially life-threatening condition.
2. Hypotension/shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock due to severe acute on chronic CHF, LVEF 25%, and possible septic shock with elevated lactate levels. This could lead to poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with involvement of the central nervous system. This poses a risk of further infection and complications.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely due to SIADH. If left untreated, this can lead to severe neurological symptoms and complications.

    MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  60 yo F with ALL recurrence with prolonged
   hospital course c/b difficult to clear high grade VRE bacteremia, prior
   ICU transfer for AMS, sepsis with PEA arrest, resp failure and VRE
   ommaya shunt infection, s/p removal and evac of SDH.  Has advanced
   cardiac dysfunction-- TTE with global HK and EF 20%.  Returned to ICU
   with acidosis and hypotension felt [**1-1**] cardiogenic + septic shock now
   doing well post extubation. Had profound lactic acidosis felt likely
   related to linezolid mitochondrial toxicity which also improved.
   Diuresed with lasix 40 with good u/o response.

   antibx--for klebsiella pna ([**Last Name (un) 1540**] day [**6-4**] ) and persistent vre infection
   (to complete prolonged course Dapto on [**5-13**]).  Effussions/edema
   contributing to continued though low O2 requirement.  She is
   auto-diuresing well and tolerating intermittent IV lasix. Follow i/o's
   and give lasix as needed to achieve neg fluid balance (of goal 1L).
   Respiratory alkalosis is stable and has been present through much of
   pt
s course--? related to CNS infection/anxiety. Per prior speech
   swallow eval should undergo video swallow--will place ngt
   for nutrition/po meds and arrange. Hyponatremia is improving with free
   water restriction, will continue to monitor.

   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Will monitor closely in ICU, continue to diurese and initiate TFs.  Can
   likely transferr to floor tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of ALL who has had a prolonged hospitalization due to VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's medical complications include acute respiratory failure, hypotension/shock, VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, hyponatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthma, hypothyroidism, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hypotension/shock: The etiology of the patient's hypotension needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
3. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Continuous monitoring of blood cultures is essential to ensure that the infection is cleared.
4. Hyponatremia: Frequent monitoring of sodium levels and water restriction are necessary to prevent worsening of the condition.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Regular monitoring of blood counts and appropriate transfusion support should be provided.
6. Asthma: Inhaler therapy should be continued and adjustments made as needed based on the patient's symptoms.
7. Hypothyroidism: If the patient is unable to take tube feeds, IV levothyroxine should be started.
8. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Lactate"

   # Acute respiratory failure: likely [**1-1**] shock - cardiogenic (TTE [**5-7**] w
   LVEF 25%) vs septic (infxn). Extubated [**5-11**], on face tent.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - check ABG
   - O2 by face mask/tent, wean as tolerated
   - treat possible cardiogenic and septic shock (see below)
   # Hypotension/Shock: Blood pressure currently stable. Etiology
   cardiogenic vs septic or both. Cardiogenic shock in the setting of
   severe acute on chronic CHF [**1-1**] chemotherapy, LVEF 25% on TTE [**5-7**].
   Total body volume overloaded. Sepsis [**1-1**] infection w possible sources

   # ? Asthma: Continue inhalers with atrovent and levalbuterol (unclear
   if this is an underlying diagnosis or these meds were started during
   her hospital course).
   # Hypothyroidism:  will start IV levothyroxine if unable to take tube
   feeds.
   # Anion-gap metabolic acidosis: Likely from tissue hypoperfusion in the
   setting of hypotension/shock, however, ddx also included linezolid side
   effect vs thiamine deficiency. Lactate 14.4 on ICU transfer, now
   lactate stable ~2. Linezolid switched to daptomycin. Given PO thiamine
   (IV was held off due to possible contamination with latex). Resolved.
   # Coagulopathy: stable elevated INR

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone an allogenic non-related stem cell transplantation (SCT), chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has a prolonged hospitalization due to VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is on a face tent and extubated, indicating respiratory distress. The underlying cause could be cardiogenic shock or septic shock, as indicated by the low blood pressure and the presence of infection.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but there is concern for cardiogenic or septic shock. This could be due to severe acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), chemotherapy, and low ejection fraction (LVEF 25%). Total body volume overload is also a contributing factor.

3. VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement: Despite previous treatments, the patient still has VRE bacteremia, which has spread to the central nervous system (CNS). An infected Omaya reservoir and indwelling left femoral venous TLC have been removed, and the patient is currently on daptomycin.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are improving, likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ("

   including the assessment and plan and agree with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   60 yo woman with ALL who has been in an out of the [**Hospital Ward Name 77**] ICU during
   her prolonged hospital course. She is s/p allogeneic non-related donor
   SCT in [**2169**] followed by relapse in [**2170**]. She then had donor lymphocyte
   infusion in [**2171**], which resulted in 4 years of disease free survival.""
   This admission was complicated by difficult to clear VRE bacteremia
   where she had an indwelling femoral line for approximately 4 weeks
   because no other access obtainable at that time. . She was initially
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on [**4-13**] in setting of likely developing sepsis
   in the setting of AMS. After arrival, pt had a PEA arrest, intubated,
   VRE grew from CSF cultures, and neurosurgery removed her Omaya
   reservior and evacuated a subdural hematoma. At that time, TTE showed
   global hypokinesis with LVEF 20%. Her respiratory and neurologic status
   improved and transferred to BMT floor on [**4-21**]. Returned to the ICU with
   respiratory failure and shock,- this time, we were able to re-site the
   line to the right femoral and now she is improving.  She is off the
   ventilator and has been doing well from a respiratory standpoint.
   Overnight:  Her urine output was low overnight and had some tachycardia

   Assessment/Plan:
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure:
   a. Now extubated and respiratory status ok
   b. Continue to monitor
   2) Metabolic Acidosis
   a. Resolved
   3) Decreased urine output: Follow urine output
 if decreases again,
   will try some albumin as she seems to be intra-vascularly depleted yet
   total body overload
   4) Hypokalemia: replace as needed
   5) Anemia:
   6) Nutritional: Tube feedings

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been through an allogeneic non-related donor stem cell transplantation (SCT), chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She has had multiple hospital admissions and is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. 

The patient's medical complications include hypotension/shock, acute respiratory failure, VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthma, hypothyroidism, hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and anxiety.

From the note, it appears that the patient is still experiencing some issues with urine output, tachycardia, and edema. Her vital signs are generally stable, but there are concerns about her cardiogenic and septic shock status, as well as potential sources of infection including previous VRE infection, VRE line infection, and Klebsiella pneumonia.

The plan moving forward includes monitoring urine output, holding off on further diuretics, and considering albumin administration if urine output continues to decrease. The patient will also continue to be monitored for respiratory status, and possible cardiogenic and septic shock will be treated accordingly. Cultures will be followed up, and ID recommendations will be sought for VRE bacteremia. Anemia and thrombocytopenia will be managed, and nutritional support through tube feedings will be continued."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent an allogeneic non-related stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She has been hospitalized for a prolonged period due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia with central nervous system involvement. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is experiencing poor urine output with tachycardia following a Lasix dose yesterday. She received small boluses yesterday but is third spacing. Her blood pressure is currently stable, but the etiology of shock remains uncertain, with possibilities including cardiogenic, septic, or a combination of both. Cardiogenic shock may be related to severe acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) due to chemotherapy and a low ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% on echocardiogram (TTE). Sepsis is also possible, potentially caused by a prior VRE infection, VRE line infection (after removal of a right femoral venous line), or Klebsiella pneumonia (pan-sensitive Klebsiella). A new line placement has been done.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has cardiogenic (due to CHF) versus septic (due to infection) shock. She was intubated but extubated on"

   I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed the resident
s note
   including the assessment and plan and agree with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   60 yo woman with ALL who has been in an out of the [**Hospital Ward Name 77**] ICU during
   her prolonged hospital course. She is s/p allogeneic non-related donor
   SCT in [**2169**] followed by relapse in [**2170**]. She then had donor lymphocyte
   infusion in [**2171**], which resulted in 4 years of disease free survival.""
   This admission was complicated by difficult to clear VRE bacteremia
   where she had an indwelling femoral line for approximately 4 weeks
   because no other access obtainable at that time. . She was initially
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] on [**4-13**] in setting of likely developing sepsis
   in the setting of AMS. After arrival, pt had a PEA arrest, intubated,
   VRE grew from CSF cultures, and neurosurgery removed her Omaya
   reservior and evacuated a subdural hematoma. At that time, TTE showed
   global hypokinesis with LVEF 20%. Her respiratory and neurologic status
   improved and transferred to BMT floor on [**4-21**]. Returned to the ICU with
   respiratory failure and shock,- this time, we were able to re-site the
   line to the right femoral and now she is improving. She is off the
   ventilator and has been doing well from a respiratory standpoint.
   Overnight: Her urine output was very low but after albumin followed by
   lasix it picked up remarkably
   T 96.7 P 110   BP 96/67    RR 20   100% on NC 3 liters
   Gen: Awake, alert NAD
   Chest: CTA bilaterally
   Cor: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: soft NTND
   Ext: +1 edema bilaterally
   Cultures:
   Klebsiella pneumonia from sputum otherwise no new culture growth
   Assessment/Plan:
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure:
   a. Now extubated and respiratory status much improved.  Does have some
   mild hypoxia requiring 3 liters of NC but she is saturating at 100%
   with this and is breathing very comfortably.  Her continued hypoxia is
   likely from pulmonary edema and she continues to be diuresed
   b. Continue gentle diuresis
   2) Decreased urine output: Much improved with albumin/lasix
   4) Hypokalemia: replace as needed
   5) Anemia:
   6) Nutritional: Tube feedings
   7) Physical Therapy
   Time Spent: 35 minutes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. 

The patient has a history of chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, donor lymphocyte infusion, and prolonged hospitalization. She was initially admitted to the ICU due to likely developing sepsis in the setting of acute mental status changes (AMS). The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, intubation, VRE bacteremia with central nervous system involvement, and removal of an Omaya reservoir with evacuation of a subdural hematoma. At that time, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed global hypokinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. Her respiratory and neurologic status improved, and she was transferred to the bone marrow transplant floor. 

The patient returned to the ICU with respiratory failure and shock. She was able to improve with re-siting the line to the right femoral vein and received albumin and lasix to improve urine output. 

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature (T) 96.7 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse (P) 110 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) 96/67 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 99% on nasal cannula (NC) with 3 liters of oxygen. 

Physical examination findings include being awake, alert, and oriented (NAD), clear to auscultate bilaterally in the chest, regular heart sounds with S1 and S2, soft abdomen with no tenderness or nodularity, and mild bilateral edema. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, sepsis without organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, and altered mental status. 

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing gentle diuresis, monitoring urine output, following up with blood cultures, and considering the addition of levothyroxine if unable to take tube feeds. 

Overall, the patient is stable and improving, with improved respiratory status and urine output. However, she still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical issues."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone a bone marrow transplant, chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and has a history of multiple hospital admissions.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing shock, possibly due to cardiogenic or septic causes. She has been extubated but remains on a face tent with oxygen supplementation. Her respiratory status should be closely monitored, and ABG analysis should be performed as needed. Weaning off the face mask should be done cautiously.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's ejection fraction (LVEF) is 25% on TTE, indicating compromised cardiac function. This may be related to her underlying ALL and previous chemotherapy treatment.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement. Although cultures have not shown any growth since April 12th, infected lines have been removed. Antibiotic therapy with meropenem, daptomycin, and ciprofloxacin has been completed.
4. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient has experienced arrhythmias, which should be monitored and treated accordingly.
5. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's ability to take oral feeds is uncertain due to her altered mental status. Nutritional support is being provided through a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone a bone marrow transplant (allo non-related SCT), chemotherapy, and donor lymphocyte infusion. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including cardiogenic shock, sepsis without organ dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmia, altered mental status, and hypotension. The etiology of the shock is unclear, with both cardiogenic and septic causes being considered.

The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia with CNS involvement, which was treated with linezolid and daptomycin. She also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, possible asthma, hypothyroidism, hyponatremia, and coagulopathy.

In terms of treatment, the patient has been given various medications such as albumin, Lasix, meropenem, daptomycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and ativan. She is being closely monitored for respiratory status, urine output, blood cultures, urinalysis, and sputum cultures.

The patient's prognosis is poor due to her underlying ALL and prolonged hospitalization."
