   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: CK peaked at .  Patient underwent cath
   with 3 BMS to distal SVG to OM with subsequent persistent low BPs so
   placed on dopamine and IABP.
   - cardiac index 3.3 on arrival to CVICU with dopa 15 and IABP 1:1
   - reassess CI later tonight
   - eval for tamponade now (prelim neg).
   - continue dopa 15 and titrate prn.
   - continue IABP 1:1
   - trend CE - still rising
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 600x1 then 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus for his IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR
   so will diurese for goal I<O -500 tonight.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - continue dopa for inotrophy
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: intubated for airway protection but now with
   hypoxic resp failure.  Suspect underlying obstructive dz from 120 pack
   yrs tobb hx.  Suspect asp pneumonitis and suspect pulm congestion from
   elevated LVEDP
   - continue FiO2 100% and PEEP 10 for O2 sat>92.
   - frequent suctioning
   - monitor Pplateau and Ppeak which have been normal thus far
   - diurese gently
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - vanco/zosyn
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG 14 so some degree of anion gap acidosis likely
   [**1-1**] lactate.  Delta/delta suggests concomittant nongap likely from
   ARF.  Based on winter's formula, pCO2 should be 31-34 so will increase
   minute ventilation to improve pH.
   - recheck gas after increasing rate to 24 and Vt to 550.
   - likely pressor activity will improve with improvement in acidosis.
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3 - now 2.5.  FeNa 5.7 (although had been given
   lasix) suggestive of ATN.  FeUrea 25% suggests prerenal.  regardless,
   suspect poor renal perfusion and ATN.
   - diurese as above for goal -500
   - treat hyperkalemia with insulin IV and recheck
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d
   .
   # question of SVC perforation: [**Month (only) 11**] have occurred during placement of
   cortis.  CXR with no significant widening of mediastinum and echo
   prelim without pericardial effusion.
   - monitor hct and xfuse for <28
   - repeat CXR in am
   - if becomes hypotensive with rising CVP, will consider tamponade as
   etiology and d/w cards team
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: continue asacol 1600 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # depression: celexa
   .
   # hx of GERD: use H2 blocker instead of PPI since plavix

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He was admitted with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the perioperative period and is now experiencing cardiogenic shock post intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 76/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with poor response to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine, lactate, and troponin-T, indicating ongoing myocardial injury and potential complications such as sepsis or acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient's medical complications include cardiogenic shock, STEMI, aspiration pneumonitis, hypoxic respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and possible superior vena cava (SVC) perforation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the current condition include worsening cardiogenic shock, development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), progression of ARF into chronic kidney disease (CKD), and potential need for renal replacement therapy (R"

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Cardiac index
   down to 2.7 from 3.5 but may not be reliable given dramatic shifts in
   O2 saturation and hg.
   - Plan to trial IABP on 1:2 pump
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed for septic physiology and
   cardiogenic shock   with goal MAPs 60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
 hour after pump change
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta delta
   suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure and lactate
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3
 stable for last 24 hours at mid 2s.  FeUrea
   25% suggests prerenal.  regardless, suspect poor renal perfusion and
   ATN.
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He was admitted with a STEMI during the perioperative period and is now experiencing cardiogenic shock. The patient's hemodynamics have improved with the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), but he remains hypotensive. He has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock and a STEMI, likely due to ischemia. His cardiac index has decreased from 3.5 to 2.7, but this may not be reliable due to dramatic shifts in oxygen saturation and hemoglobin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. It is crucial to maintain adequate cardiac output and blood pressure to prevent further complications.
2. STEMI: The patient had a STEMI during the perioperative period. There is a risk of ongoing ischemia and potential reinfarction. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and close observation for signs of recurrent chest pain or changes in ECG is necessary.
3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased from 1.3 to mid-2s, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is required to prevent further deterioration.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and an acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent catheterization with three bare metal stents placed in the distal saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch, and subsequently experienced persistent low blood pressures. As a result, the patient was placed on dopamine and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonitis, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury (ARF), and possible superior vena cava (SVC) perforation. The patient is intubated for airway protection and mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cardiogenic shock, persistent hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, worsening metabolic acidosis, progression of ARF, contrast nephropathy, and SVC perforation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamic status, respiratory function, renal function, and electrolyte balance. Appropriate interventions should be implemented to manage the patient's condition and prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia here with STEMI.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: likely from ischemic cause.  Patient
   underwent cath with 3 BMS to distal SVG to OM with subsequent
   persistent low BPs so placed on dopamine and IABP.
   - cardiac index 3.3 on arrival to CVICU with dopa 15 and IABP 1:1
   - reassess CI later tonight
   - eval for tamponade now (prelim neg).
   - continue dopa 15 and titrate prn.
   - continue IABP 1:1
   - trend CE - still rising
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 600x1 then 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt without bolus for his IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR
   so will diurese for goal I<O -500 tonight.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - continue dopa for inotrophy
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: intubated for airway protection but now with
   hypoxic resp failure.  Suspect underlying obstructive dz from 120 pack
   yrs tobb hx.  Suspect asp pneumonitis and suspect pulm congestion from
   elevated LVEDP
   - continue FiO2 100% and PEEP 10 for O2 sat>92.
   - frequent suctioning
   - monitor Pplateau and Ppeak which have been normal thus far
   - diurese gently
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - vanco/zosyn
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG 14 so some degree of anion gap acidosis likely
   [**1-1**] lactate.  Delta/delta suggests concomittant nongap likely from
   ARF.  Based on winter's formula, pCO2 should be 31-34 so will increase
   minute ventilation to improve pH.
   - recheck gas after increasing rate to 24 and Vt to 550.
   - likely pressor activity will improve with improvement in acidosis.
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3 - now 2.5.  FeNa 5.7 (although had been given
   lasix) suggestive of ATN.  FeUrea 25% suggests prerenal.  regardless,
   suspect poor renal perfusion and ATN.
   - diurese as above for goal -500
   - treat hyperkalemia with insulin IV and recheck
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d
   .
   # question of SVC perforation: [**Month (only) 11**] have occurred during placement of
   cortis.  CXR with no significant widening of mediastinum and echo
   prelim without pericardial effusion.
   - monitor hct and xfuse for <28
   - repeat CXR in am
   - if becomes hypotensive with rising CVP, will consider tamponade as
   etiology and d/w cards team
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: continue asacol 1600 [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with a STEMI and underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of three bare metal stents. He is currently in the cardiac intensive care unit (CVICU) with cardiogenic shock, requiring dopamine and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient's cardiac index has improved from 3.3 to 3.5, but his mixed venous oxygen saturation remains low. He also has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis, and is intubated for airway protection. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a baseline creatinine of 1.3 now elevated to 2.5, indicating acute kidney injury (ATN). Other notable findings include elevated lactate levels, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's current condition of cardiogenic shock poses a significant risk. The administration of dopamine and IABP support is necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and cardiac output.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis, which can compromise oxygenation and ventilation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and frequent suctioning of secretions are essential.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate ATN, which may be caused"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). He was admitted with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) in the perioperative period and is now experiencing cardiogenic shock post intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with three bare metal stents placed in the distal saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch. His troponin levels peaked at 6000 and are now trending down.

The patient's hemodynamics have improved with the IABP, but hypotension persists. Levophed has been initiated, suggesting possible septic physiology as well. The latest cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) values are 7 L/min, 3.7 L/min/m2, and 700 dyne/s/cm5, respectively.

The plan is to continue IABP on 1:1-1:2, discontinue dopamine, and continue weaning levophed with the goal of maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) at 60. Repeat Fick calculations will be done, and the patient will continue on aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and heparin via gtt for IABP.

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with a STEMI during the perioperative period and is now experiencing cardiogenic shock post intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) insertion.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hemodynamics improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. The cardiac index has decreased from 3.5 to 2.7, indicating reduced cardiac output. This is likely due to ischemia caused by the STEMI.
2. STEMI: The patient underwent catheterization with three bare-metal stents placed in the distal saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery. The peak CK level was 6000 and is now trending down.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated primarily for airway protection due to likely aspiration in the cath lab. There is evidence of hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD. Weaning of FiO2 to nontoxic levels as tolerated and frequent suctioning are planned.
4. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient witnessed aspiration in the cath lab, leading to aspiration pneumonitis. Although usually a chemically mediated process, it will be treated with antibiotics since there was a large volume aspiration"

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Cardiac index
   down to 2.7 from 3.5 but may not be reliable given dramatic shifts in
   O2 saturation and hg.
   - Plan to trial IABP on 1:2 pump
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed for septic physiology and
   cardiogenic shock   with goal MAPs 60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
 hour after pump change
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta delta
   suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure and lactate
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3
 stable for last 24 hours at mid 2s.  FeUrea
   25% suggests prerenal.  regardless, suspect poor renal perfusion and
   ATN.
   - monitor daily lytes and renally dose meds
   - monitor for contrast nephropathy in 2-3d
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn
   - f/u XR
   - Ortho recs

- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, including previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), peripherally inserted vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and ulcerative colitis.
- He was admitted with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the perioperative period and is now experiencing cardiogenic shock following intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement.
- The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with three bare metal stents to the distal saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch, left anterior descending artery, and diagonal branch. His peak troponin level was 6000 and is now trending down.
- Hemodynamics improved with IABP but hypotension persists, suggesting possible septic physiology. The cardiac index decreased to 2.7 from 3.5, which may not be reliable due to significant shifts in oxygen saturation and hemoglobin.
- The plan includes trialing IABP on a 1:2 pump, discontinuing dopamine, and continuing levophed for septic physiology and cardiogenic shock with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60.
- Repeat Fick calculations will be done after pump change. Continue aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, and heparin infusion for IABP.
- The patient's cardiac output is supported as previously mentioned."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ulcerative colitis, and coronary artery bypass graft who is currently admitted to the ICU for cardiac and respiratory issues. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and low cardiac output, indicating possible cardiogenic shock. There are concerns about acute respiratory failure and a possible myocardial infarction. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing support from mechanical ventilation and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and low cardiac output suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. This condition may progress to more severe forms such as ARDS if not adequately managed.
3. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and current symptoms raise concerns about an ongoing myocardial infarction. Prompt intervention is necessary to minimize further cardiac damage.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and positive culture results indicate the possibility of an infection, which can worsen the patient's overall condition and complicate treatment.
5. Coagulopathy: The elevated PT/INR and prolonged PTT suggest an increased risk of bleeding, highlighting the need for careful monitoring and management of coagulation factors.
6. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated serum"

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Latest
   CO/CI/SVR @ 0330=7/3.7/700.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1-1:2
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed, but con
t to wean, with goal MAPs
   60
   - Repeat Fick calculations
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.
   -  vanco/zosyn
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: Previous AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta
   delta suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure and lactate
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3
 stable for last 24 hours at mid 2s.  FeUrea
   25% suggests prerenal.  regardless, suspect poor renal perfusion and

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2859**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Critical care time 60 minutes.  Unstable hemodynamics and pressor
   dependent.  Spiked fever.  Some component of distributive shock on top
   of cardiogenic shock.  Needs to maintain IABP for now since when we
   wean, he becomes hypotensive. Aspiration pneumonia being presumptively
   treated with antibiotics.  Remains very tenuous.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2176-4-28**] 10:26 ------
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He presented with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the perioperative period and is now experiencing cardiogenic shock. The patient has been treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and is being managed for respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonitis. He also has acute kidney injury (AKI) with an elevated creatinine level, metabolic acidosis, and ulcerative colitis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen if the ischemia is not adequately managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if the aspiration pneumonitis is not treated effectively.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's AKI may further deteriorate if renal perfusion is not improved.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may continue if the underlying cause, such as lactate production, is not addressed.
5. Ulcerative colitis: The patient's ulcerative colitis may lead to complications such as severe bleeding or toxic megacolon.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being intubated for an extended period."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) in the perioperative period and is now experiencing cardiogenic shock post intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement.

The patient's medical conditions include:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hemodynamics have improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. This could be due to ischemia from the recent STEMI.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient likely aspirated in the cath lab and is now intubated for airway protection. There is evidence of hypoxia due to edema, consolidation, and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
3. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient experienced witnessed aspiration in the cath lab, leading to intubation and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap (AG) of 15 likely from lactate. This suggests a non-gap acidosis due to renal failure.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.3, which has stabilized at mid-2s. The FeUrea level of"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), percutaneous vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the perioperative period and now presents with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent catheterization with three bare-metal stents placed in the distal saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid marginal artery and diagonal branch. His creatine kinase (CK) level peaked at 6000 and is now downtrending. 

The patient's hemodynamics improved with the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), but he remains hypotensive. His cardiac index has decreased to 2.7 from 3.5, and there may be some septic physiology as well. The plan is to trial the IABP on a 1:2 pump, discontinue dopamine, and continue with levophed for septic physiology and cardiogenic shock, aiming for mean arterial pressures (MAPs) of 60. Repeat Fick calculations will be done one hour after the pump change.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period and now presents with cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and received three bare-metal stents (BMS) to the distal saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the omohyoid artery (OM) and diagonal artery. His cardiac index is down to 2.7 from 3.5, and he has been placed on levophed for septic physiology and cardiogenic shock with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock due to ischemia from the myocardial infarction (MI). Hemodynamics improved with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), but hypotension persists. The patient is currently being supported with dopamine and levophed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration in the cath lab. There is evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and the patient requires frequent boluses of fluids.
3. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient witnessed aspiration in the cath lab, leading to intubation primarily for airway protection. Although usually a chemically mediated process"

   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 indicating a massive amount of
   ischemia. Given severity of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to
   ischemia. Hemodynamics improved with IABP, but hypotension persists.
   Levophed downtitrated over last 24 hrs. Latest CO/CI/SVR =5.8/3.1/1012
   (CI down from 4.2, SVR up from 843). TTE on day of admission with EF
   that was not very suppressed.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1
   - Continue dopamine and d/c levophed for enhanced cardiogenc shock
   pressor treatment.
   - Repeat Fick calculations with change in pressors
   - continue ASA 325
   - [**Year (4 digits) 1167**] 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   - Repeat TTE today to assess for change in EF. I predict EF will be
   markedly reduced from TTE on admission.
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR.
   Now that HD improved, patient will likely benefit from continued
   afterolad reduction with diuretics given fluid overload on exam
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x1. Goal I/O
 500 cc if BP will allow
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Patient did not have appropriate bump to
   PRBC transfusion yesterday. Platelets continue to downtrend. I suspect
   hemolysis from balloon pump. Guaiac positive NG output worrisome for
   UGIB. Plan for goal Hct greater than 26. TTP unlikely as this is
   relatively new. HIT unlikely as there is a another good explanation for
   thromobocytopenia (4T score
 meets criteria for > 50% plt fall, but
   plt drop in less than 5 days, no clots and pt has other good reason for
   low plts)
   - Add on hemolysis labs
   - Start IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider HIT ab if [**Hospital1 6350**].
   - Will continue heparin gtt/[**Hospital1 1167**] for now. If Hct [**Last Name (LF) 6350**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   need to address utility of continuing heparin in setting of bleed vs
   taking IABP out
   .
   # Vomiting: [**Month (only) 11**] be due to UGIB or more likely ileus secondary to
   sedating meds.
   - KUB today to asses for obstruction
   - Start PPI as above
   - Limit sedating meds as much as possible
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Although this is usually chemically mediated, abx were started
   given dramatically low BPs. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation,
   and underlying COPD. FiO2 increased last night back to 60 for hypoxia.
   Plan to reduce FiO2 today as anticipate diuresis will improve
   oxygenation.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated pending diuresis

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress and potential medical complications:

1. The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to cardiogenic shock and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) post-CABG.

2. The patient's hemodynamics have improved with the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), but he still experiences hypotension. Levophed has been downtitrated, and dopamine has been started for enhanced cardiac output.

3. The patient's cardiac ejection fraction (EF) is expected to be markedly reduced, and an echocardiogram (TTE) will be repeated today.

4. The patient's cardiosupport includes the continuation of aspirin, heparin, and simvastatin.

5. The patient has fluid overload and pulmonary edema, so Lasix 20 mg IV will be given to promote diuresis and reduce fluid accumulation. Afterload reduction with IABP will also be continued.

6. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia. A goal hematocrit (Hct) greater than 26 will be targeted, and hemolysis labs will be added. Prophyl"

   Assessment and Plan
   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 and now downtrending. Given severity
   of MI cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia. Hemodynamics
   improved with IABP, but hypotension persists. Doing better now on
   levophed, which may imply some septic physiology as well. Latest
   CO/CI/SVR @ 0330=7/3.7/700.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1-1:2
   - D/c Dopamine and continue levophed, but con
t to wean, with goal MAPs

   - Repeat Fick calculations
   - continue ASA 325
   - [**Year (4 digits) 1167**] 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
   .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis on prelim echo post intervention.
   Support cardiac outpt as above.  LVEDP 25 in lab and pulm edema on CXR,
   but patient will require frequent boluses over thecourse of the day.
   - hold on ACE in setting of ARF
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   - Goal I/o positive 1-2 liters with boluses as needed
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation, and underlying COPD.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   .
   # Aspiration pneumonitis: witnessed aspiration in cath lab and now
   intubated primarily for airway protection.  Although usually a
   chemically mediated process, will treat with abx since large volume
   aspiration and resp failure.
   - pan culture
   - taper down abx if able
   - treat resp failure as above.

   # metabolic acidosis: Previous AG up to 15 likely from lactate. Delta
   delta suggests nongap acidosis likely due to renal failure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient experienced a myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the perioperative period and developed cardiogenic shock. He was treated with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and received three bare-metal stents (BMS) to the distal saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the obtuse marginal (OM) coronary artery.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock and STEMI, as well as hypotension, which is being managed with levophed. The patient's cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) are being closely monitored. The plan includes continuing IABP on 1:1-1:2 support, discontinuing dopamine, and weaning off levophed with the goal of maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60 mmHg.

Other medical issues mentioned in the progress note include pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, inferolateral hypokinesis on preliminary echocardiogram post-intervention, aspiration pneumonia, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury (AKI), and ulcerative colitis. The patient is also taking medications for depression, GERD, and pain management.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include wors"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an intubated, sedated, and critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and ulcerative colitis. They have been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and acute myocardial infarction. The patient received multiple units of packed red blood cells due to low hemoglobin levels and continues to be on vasopressor support. They have also received antibiotics for suspected infections. The patient's vital signs remain unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. They are experiencing moderate fluid loss through various drainage routes. The patient's lab results show abnormal kidney function, elevated cardiac enzymes, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's condition remains critical, and they are currently on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition indicates cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening complication that can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. This condition can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further lung damage and inadequate oxygenation.
3. Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack): The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, which can cause further damage to the heart muscle and may result in arrhythmias, heart failure, or other cardiac complications.

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, and ulcerative colitis. He presented to the ICU with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, shock, respiratory failure, and acute myocardial infarction. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 136/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 60% FiO2. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral chest tube insertion sites, 1+ edema to 6 cm above the ankle, and soft 1+ pulses bilaterally. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Renal function tests indicate a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Cardiac enzymes are elevated with a troponin-T level of 15.28. Liver function tests show elevated AST and alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient's most recent blood cultures from 04/29/2176 at 09:30 PM and 04/30/2176 at 05:30 AM are positive for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He was admitted with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock post intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement. 

Summary of Progress:
- The patient's hemodynamics are improving with the IABP.
- Levophed has been weaned off, and he remains on dopamine.
- The latest CO/CI/SVR values indicate improvement.
- A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) yesterday showed a mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45-50%.
- The plan is to continue the IABP on 1:1 support.
- Dopamine will be continued for enhanced cardiogenic shock pressor treatment.
- Medications such as aspirin (ASA) 325, clopidogrel (plavix) 75 daily, and simvastatin 80 will be continued.
- Heparin will be continued for IABP management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock due to ischemia. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and continued support with IABP and dopamine will be necessary.
2. STEMI: The patient had a STEMI in the perioperative period. Continued cardiac support and monitoring will be"

   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to

   Hemodynamics improved with IABP. Levophed has been weaned off and pt
   now only on dopamine. Latest CO/CI/SVR = 7/3.8/801( 5.3/2.9/632).  TTE
   yesterday demonstrated mildly depressed LVEF with EF 45-50%.
   - Plan to con

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period. He is now experiencing cardiogenic shock and has been placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. His hemodynamics have improved, but he still requires dopamine for enhanced cardiogenic shock pressor treatment. He has mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45-50%. He also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be due to hemolysis from the balloon pump. Other issues include vomiting, hypoxic respiratory failure/aspiration, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, pain control after shoulder surgery, ulcerative colitis, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration in cardiac function leading to worsening cardiogenic shock.
2. STEMI: The patient has a recent history of STEMI, and there is a possibility of recurrent myocardial ischemia or infarction.
3. Hemolysis: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be due to hemolysis from the balloon pump. This condition needs to be monitored closely.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's vomiting and use of anticoagulants increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding"

   75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and
   Diagonal), PVD, HTN, admitted with STEMI in perioperative period and
   now with cardiogenic shock s/p IABP.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI: .Patient underwent cath with 3 BMS to
   distal SVG to OM CK peaked at 6000 indicating a massive amount of
   ischemia. Cardiogenic shock is most likely due to ischemia.
   Hemodynamics improved with IABP. Levophed has been weaned off and pt
   now only on dopamine. Latest CO/CI/SVR = 7/3.8/801( 5.3/2.9/632).  TTE
   yesterday demonstrated mildly depressed LVEF with EF 45-50%.
   - Plan to con
t  IABP on 1:1
   - Continue dopamine for enhanced cardiogenc shock pressor treatment.
   - Repeat Fick calculations with change in pressors
   - continue ASA 325
   - plavix 75 daily
   - continue heparin gtt for IABP
   - continue simvastatin 80
    .
   # Cards Pump: Inferiolat hypokinesis persisted on ECHO yesterdayCont
   afterload reduction with diuretics.
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x1. Goal I/O
 500 cc if BP will allow
   - afterload reduce with IABP
   - consider milrinone if SVR goes up and peripherally clamps down.  Hold
   for now.
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 60-70
s for now.  Hold BB
   .
   # Anemia/thrombocytopenia: Hct trending up though plts cont to trend
   down likely [**1-1**] hemolysis from balloon pump. Hemolysis labs
   unremarkable. TTP unlikely as this is relatively new. HIT unlikely as
   there is a another good explanation for thromobocytopenia (4T score
   meets criteria for > 50% plt fall, but plt drop in less than 5 days, no
   clots and pt has other good reason for low plts)
   - Cont IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Will continue heparin gtt/plavix for now. If Hct [**Last Name (LF) 6350**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   need to address utility of continuing heparin in setting of bleed vs
   taking IABP out
   .
   # Vomiting: [**Month (only) 11**] be due to UGIB or more likely ileus secondary to
   sedating meds.
   - No e/o obstruction or ileus on KUB
   - PPI as above
   - Limit sedating meds as much as possible
   .
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure/Aspiration: Likely due to aspiration in Cath
   lab. Although this is usually chemically mediated, abx were started
   given dramatically low BPs. Hypoxia likely due to edema, consolidation,
   and underlying COPD. FiO2 increased last night back to 60 for hypoxia.
   Hoping that cont diuresis will improve oxygenation.
   - Wean FiO2 to   nontoxic levels as tolerated pending diuresis
   - frequent suctioning
   - MDI albuterol and atrovent for suspected COPD underlying
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now. Will uptitrate vanco to 1 g daily given
   improved renal function.
   - F/u cx data and CIS
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Improving non gap acidosis which was likely due
   to renal failure.
   - Improvement with dynamics should improve renal failure
   - trend ABGs daily
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 1.3
 and now improved markedly to 1.6.   FeUrea 25%

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient developed a STEMI in the perioperative period and subsequently developed cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent catheterization and was found to have three blocked arteries, which were stented. The patient also received an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) to support his blood pressure.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, STEMI, and hypoxic respiratory failure. The plan is to continue the IABP on 1:1 support, continue dopamine for enhanced cardiogenic shock pressor treatment, repeat Fick calculations with changes in pressors, and continue other medications such as aspirin, Plavix, heparin, and simvastatin.

The patient's cardiac pump function is still showing inferiolateral hypokinesis, and there is a plan to continue afterload reduction with diuretics. The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 60-70 beats per minute.

The patient also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be related to hemolysis from the balloon pump. Hemolysis labs are unremarkable, and other causes for thrombocytopenia are being considered.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, depression, GERD, and recent shoulder surgery. Pain control"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period and now presents with cardiogenic shock secondary to ischemia. The patient underwent insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and is currently on dopamine for enhanced cardiogenic shock pressor treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hemodynamics are improving with the IABP, but there is a need for continued monitoring and management of cardiogenic shock.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is trending down, which may be related to hemolysis from the balloon pump. Further evaluation is needed, including sending heparin-dependent antibodies and stopping potential contributing medications like PPI and Vanc.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to aspiration during catheterization and underlying COPD. Oxygenation is being managed with FiO2 adjustments, frequent suctioning, and bronchodilators.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient had resolved metabolic acidosis but requires ongoing monitoring.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is increasing, suggesting possible renal hypoperfusion and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal function needs"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Goal fluid status -500 mL
   - Thrombocytopenia: will stop Vanc/Zosyn (Vanc could be contributing)
   and stop famotidine/pantoprazole. Most likely thrombocytopenia related
   to IABP.Did send off HIT Ab today.
   - ? Aspiration PNA: started Levaquin to replace Vanc/Zosyn
   -Holding Asacol per pharmacy (cannot crush PO and PR is only
   local).Emailed primary gastroenterologist re: PR Asacol.
   - Starting TF slowly
   - Afternoon gas showed improved O2 to 165 so FiO2 [**Month (only) 202**] to 50%-->repeat

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), admitted with a STEMI during the perioperative period and now experiencing cardiogenic shock following intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic Shock/STEMI: The patient remains in cardiogenic shock with labile blood pressures overnight. Autonomic instability is suspected, and the patient is on dopamine for enhanced cardiogenic shock pressor treatment. The plan is to continue IABP on 1:1, maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 60, and attempt to wean dopamine off today.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped, which could be due to hemolysis from the balloon pump. Although the 4T score is intermediate, it is unlikely given the probable explanation of hemolysis. The patient's platelet count is now stable, so heparin will be continued, and other contributing factors such as proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and vancomycin will be stopped.

3. Respiratory Failure/Aspiration: The patient likely has hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration during the catheterization lab. Oxygenation is being improved with diuresis, and FiO"

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He presented with a STEMI in the perioperative period and is now experiencing cardiogenic shock. The patient's condition has been stabilized with the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate ranging from 55-77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 68-125 mmHg, respiratory rate at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's lab results show thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 111,000/mm³. He also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL and elevated lactate levels at 2.1 mmol/L. Renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient's plan includes continuing the use of the IABP, dopamine for pressure support, and ASA, Plavix, heparin, and simvastatin for cardiac management. Lasix will be given to manage fluid balance and diuresis. The patient's rhythm is mostly normal sinus rhythm with occasional"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, who was admitted with a STEMI in the perioperative period and now presents with cardiogenic shock following intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement. He remains intubated and sedated. The patient's condition is described as unstable, with labile vital signs and ongoing efforts to optimize fluid status and manage multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is concern for hemolysis related to the IABP. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is being considered, but the most likely explanation is hemolysis from the balloon pump. Heparin therapy will be continued for now.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient likely aspirated during the cath lab procedure, leading to hypoxia. FiO2 was increased to 50%, and levofloxacin has been started for this.

3. Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, and Asacol has been prescribed by the primary gastroenterologist. It is noted that Asacol cannot be crushed and should be given per rectum.

4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac function remains depressed, and efforts are"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Goal fluid status -500 mL
   - Thrombocytopenia: will stop Vanc/Zosyn (Vanc could be contributing)
   and stop famotidine/pantoprazole. Most likely thrombocytopenia related
   to IABP.Did send off HIT Ab today.
   - ? Aspiration PNA: started Levaquin to replace Vanc/Zosyn
   -Holding Asacol per pharmacy (cannot crush PO and PR is only
   local).Emailed primary gastroenterologist re: PR Asacol.
   - Starting TF slowly
   - Afternoon gas showed improved O2 to 165 so FiO2 [**Month (only) 202**] to 50%-->repeat
   ABG O2 98 so FiO2 weaned to 40%
   - I/Os at 1730 showed -740 fluid balance p midnight but +190 since 8AM,
   with hourly UOP as low as 15cc/hr. Will re-check at 11PM and consider
   bolus/lasix.
   - Per GI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6405**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6406**]), OK to hold Asacol if no signs of UC. If
   develops signs of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] use low-dose prednisone.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, ulcerative colitis, and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction (STEMI), and septic shock. 

The patient's current condition shows improved oxygenation with an ABG indicating an oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. However, there is still a need for respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate in the 50s, blood pressure around 90/40 mmHg, respiratory rate at 16 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits at 11 mmHg, and the pulmonary artery pressures are relatively low as well.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -740 mL since midnight, indicating ongoing fluid resuscitation. The urine output has been low at 15 cc/hr, and further evaluation is planned to consider the use of diuretics or dopamine.

Regarding medications, the patient is currently receiving midazolam, heparin, fentanyl, dopamine, and various other ICU medications. The antibiotics have been changed"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Cardiogenic Shock/STEMI: Has required IABP-- Latest
   Co/CI/SVR=7.3/3.9/722. BP labilility improved-- Likely a component of
   autonomic dysregulation.
   - Plan to DC IABP
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Continue ASA 325, Plavix 75, DC heparin gtt for IABP, simva 80.
   - Try to wean FiO2 again today.
   .
   # PUMP: Still volume up.Put out well to 40 IV lasix.
   - Goal I/O -1000 cc today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Mostly NSR with rate 50s-60s, sporadic PVCs. Hold BB.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT and PLTslightly improved. Will follow today and consider
   transfusion if continues to drop.
   - Continue to avoid drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia
   - Transfusion for Hct<21 or >3pt Hct drop
   .
   # Abd Distension: Active bowel sounds though nearly no stool output
   past few days. Possible to could represent obstruction versus ileus
   versus reduced gastric motlity secondary to limited feeding.
   - KUB to r/o obstruction
   -Holding TF [**1-1**] high residulas
   - Consider reglan to improve motility if no obstruction on KUB
   .
   # Resp Failure/Aspiration:
   - CXR to assess tube placement
   - Cont to wean FiO2
   - frequent suctioning
   - continue nebs
   - Continue levaquin for asp PNA
DC tomorrow for 10 day course
   .
   # ARF. Cre improved O/N.
   - monitor daily lytes, renally dose meds
   .
   # s/p shoulder surgery
   - continue pain control with fentanyl bolus prn
   .
   # UC. per GI, d/c asacol for now.
   - guaiac stools to make sure UC is not flaring. if flares, LD
   prednisone.
   .
   # depression. celexa.
   # GERD. conitnue to avoid H2b or PPI for now due to thrombocytopenia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male admitted to the ICU for cardiogenic shock and STEMI. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 70% and PEEP 8. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was initiated. The patient's vital signs remain stable with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure in the 120s/60s mmHg range, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation above 99%, and temperature around 36.1 degrees Celsius. The patient's cardiac rhythm is mostly normal sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 120. Laboratory results indicate normal WBC count, slightly low Hct and platelet count, elevated CK, CKMB, and Troponin-T levels, and normal electrolyte levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation and the need for high FiO2 indicate ongoing hypoxemia. This could be due to the underlying respiratory failure or inadequate ventilation/perfusion matching.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation suggests ongoing respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration if ventilation parameters are not optimized.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's initial"

   # Cardiogenic Shock/STEMI: Has required IABP-- Latest
   Co/CI/SVR=7.3/3.9/722. BP labilility improved-- Likely a component of
   autonomic dysregulation.
   - Plan to DC IABP
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Continue ASA 325, Plavix 75, DC heparin gtt for IABP, simva 80.
   - Try to wean FiO2 again today.

   # PUMP: Still volume up.Put out well to 40 IV lasix.
   - Goal I/O -1000 cc today
   .
   # RHYTHM: Mostly NSR with rate 50s-60s, sporadic PVCs. Hold BB.
   .
   # Anemia: HCT and PLTslightly improved. Will follow today and consider
   transfusion if continues to drop.
   - Continue to avoid drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia
   - Transfusion for Hct<21 or >3pt Hct drop

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock and STEMI. He has been receiving IABP, dopamine, and various medications including ASA, Plavix, simva, and heparin. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 127/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 120. His physical examination reveals an intubated and sedated patient with no murmurs or signs of congestion. The patient's labs indicate slightly improved WBC count, Hct, and Plt. However, his Cr, TCO2, and LDH levels are elevated. 

Potential Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock/STEMI: The patient's condition can worsen if there is a reinfarction or if the heart function does not improve.
2. Respiratory Failure/Aspiration: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia and aspiration due to endotracheal intubation.
3. Pump Failure: The patient may develop further volume overload or kidney dysfunction if fluid balance is not managed properly.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is still low, and he may require transfusion if it"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypoxia with an oxygen saturation level of 88%. The patient's condition has not significantly changed since admission. The patient is currently on FiO2 70% and PEEP 8.

The patient's echo shows no evidence of PFO or right ventricular strain. Dopamine was turned off but the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is in the 40s, so dopamine was restarted at a dose of 3 mcg/kg/min.

The patient has an arterial line placed and HIT antibody test is negative. There has been a slight decrease in urine output, with an intake/output negative 1.1L since 2300.

The patient's Fick values show an increase in cardiac index from 1:4 at 4 am to 5.4/2.9/833 at 3 pm. The ABG values indicate improvement in respiratory status.

The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). They are also on various infusions such as heparin sodium, dopamine, midazolam (Versed), and fentanyl (Concentrate).

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/62 to 155/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute,"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of depression, GERD, and fenorrenal disease. He presented to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon evaluation, he was found to have hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 88%. A chest X-ray revealed a slightly worsened effusion. The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 8. An echocardiogram showed no evidence of PFO or right ventricular strain. Dopamine was restarted at 3 mcg/kg/min due to a low mean arterial pressure in the 40s. An arterial line was placed, and HIT antibody testing was negative.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 127/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has increased from 76.4 kg at admission to 86.9 kg currently. His central venous pressure is 12 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures are 52/22 mmHg, and cardiac output/index is 7 L/min with a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 59-69%.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1.1 liters and output of 2.9 liters, resulting in a negative balance of -1"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of cardiogenic shock and STEMI. He remains in the ICU for further management. The patient's condition is stable, with a blood pressure of 127/62 mmHg and heart rate of 68 bpm. He is intubated and sedated, with spontaneous respiration suppressed. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on supplemental oxygen via endotracheal tube.

The patient's chest X-ray shows a slightly worsened effusion compared to the previous day. An echocardiogram was performed, which did not reveal any patent foramen ovale (PFO) or right ventricular strain.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including dopamine for hemodynamic support, midazolam for sedation, and fentanyl for pain control. He is also on heparin sodium, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin for infection prophylaxis.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin T, and CK-MB, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's urine output has been stable, with a total output of 2,886 mL over the past 24 hours. His blood products usage has been significant, with a total output of 2,946 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is still intubated and sedated in the ICU. The fluid balance is negative by 1.6 liters, indicating a potential fluid deficit. The patient's cortisol levels are low, with a Stim value of 11.3 initially and increasing to 18.2, which prompted the administration of hydrocortisone. Dopamine was weaned off, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was removed. The patient's abdominal exam shows mild distension and tympanicity, with bowel sounds present. Trace edema is noted in the extremities. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). There are also abnormalities in creatinine (Cr), troponin T, total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and glucose levels. The patient is being given Reglan and Dulcolax to address nonspecific bowel pattern. Haldol is administered for agitation as needed. There have been no changes in ventilator settings.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance due to negative fluid balance.
2. Adrenal insufficiency or cortisol deficiency, as indicated by low Stim values and the administration of hydrocortisone.
3. Gastrointestinal issues such as bowel obstruction or ileus, given the presence of abdominal distension, tym"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock and STEMI. The patient is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance is negative 1.6 liters. The patient has shown improvement in their hemodynamic status, with stable pressures and increased CO/CI (Fick) values. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, but all other lab results are within normal range. The patient's HCT has increased from 25.8 to 27.9 overnight, indicating improving anemia. The patient's PTT is prolonged, likely due to IABP. The patient is receiving hydrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency. The patient's abdomen remains distended, but there are no concerning signs on KUB. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.3, indicating improving renal function. The patient is still on fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation, respectively. The patient's FiO2 is being weaned to 40% today, and there will be an attempt to wean off the ventilator aggressively today with reduced sedation. The patient's disposition is CCU for now. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The plan is to elevate the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of depression, UC, s/p shoulder surgery, and ARF. The patient is currently in the ICU due to cardiogenic shock and STEMI. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 136/56-145/69 mmHg and a heart rate of 99 bpm. The patient is intubated and sedated, but responds to pain. The patient's fluid balance is negative 1600 mL, indicating fluid loss.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient failed [**Last Name (un)**] stim, suggesting adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone has been started to address this issue.
2. Volume depletion: The patient has a significant fluid loss, indicated by a negative fluid balance of 1600 mL. This could lead to hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains on ventilatory support with an FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. Weaning attempts will be made today with reduced sedation.
4. Constipation: The patient's abdomen remains distended, likely due to constipation. An aggressive bowel regimen has been initiated to prevent further complications.
5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is improving but still elevated at 1.3. Close monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure.
- The patient's condition improved, and they were extubated. However, they experienced hypoxia and hypertension, leading to the initiation of non-invasive ventilation.
- Non-invasive ventilation was initially stopped but then restarted due to the patient's respiratory status.
- The patient's vital signs were stable, with an acceptable range of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
- The patient's cardiac status showed improvement, with a decrease in chest pain and a stable electrocardiogram (ECG).
- The patient's renal function was monitored, with a negative fluid balance.
- The patient's mental status fluctuated, with periods of alertness and disorientation.
- The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms included nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension, which resolved spontaneously.
- The patient's lab results indicated thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated lactate levels.
- The patient's medication regimen included multiple cardiac medications, antibiotics, and pain control medications.
- The patient's allergies were documented as no known drug allergies.
- The patient's medical history included coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), ulcerative colitis, and depression.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, ulcerative colitis, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He was admitted to the ICU for cardiogenic shock and acute respiratory failure following an episode of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is extubated and currently on BIPAP, with improved respiratory status and vital signs. However, he experienced hypotension and hypoxia overnight, requiring the administration of IV lasix and a nitro drip. The patient also presented with dizziness and a feeling of being ""vertical,"" which may be related to weaning sedation or an inner-ear process. Other notable findings include thrombocytopenia, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status, and anemia. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, troponin-T, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The patient's chest X-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates, consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management of his cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and other comorbidities."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. He presented with cardiogenic shock and a STEMI following left shoulder surgery. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is hemodynamically stable. He has been weaned off sedation and is alert and oriented. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. His cardiac rhythm is normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the 80s. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating myocardial injury. His creatinine level has increased from 1.2 to 1.5, possibly due to aggressive diuresis. His hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are slightly improved, but he remains anemic. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. His liver function tests and kidney function tests are normal. 

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is currently tolerating oral intake and has replete electrolytes. 

Plan:
The patient will continue on aspirin, Plavix, simvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. The dose of lisinopril will be increased to 10 mg daily. The patient's diuretic medication"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and now presents with cardiogenic shock and STEMI post left shoulder surgery. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with blood pressure ranging from 129/58 mmHg to 155/77 mmHg, heart rate between 73-94 bpm, respiratory rate between 13-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is currently on various medications including aspirin, Plavix, heparin, simvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK-MB, and LDH, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. There is also evidence of renal dysfunction with an increase in creatinine from 1.2 to 1.5, possibly related to aggressive diuresis. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,182 mL and output of 2,170 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -988 mL. The patient's urine output has been consistently low, with only 400cc over a 6-hour period.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently in the ICU for cardiogenic shock and STEMI post acromioplasty. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 129/58 mmHg and heart rate of 73 bpm. He is on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and has an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly, now at 95-97% on 2L NC. 

The patient's cardiac rhythm is normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the 80s. His renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level increasing from 1.2 to 1.5. This is likely related to aggressive diuresis. Diuretic therapy should be held for now, and the patient's creatinine and electrolytes should be trended. Renal dosing of medications should also be adjusted accordingly.

The patient has an anterior left knee pain with movement, but there are no signs of swelling, bruising, or tenderness to light pressure. This pain is likely due to forceful restraining during periods of agitation while sedated. Treatment includes ice packs and close monitoring.

The patient's anemia has slightly improved, with a hematocrit level of 31.1%. There is no evidence of iron deficiency,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He presented with cardiogenic shock and STEMI following acromioplasty surgery. The patient has been receiving appropriate cardiac medications and diuretics to manage his condition.

His vital signs are relatively stable with blood pressure ranging from 129/58 mmHg to 155/77 mmHg and heart rate between 73-94 bpm. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, maintaining oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's kidney function has worsened, as indicated by an increase in creatinine from 1.2 to 1.5. This may be attributed to aggressive diuresis. Diuretic use will be held for now, and renal dosing of medications will be based on creatinine and electrolyte levels. If there is continued oliguria, IV fluids will be given as needed.

The patient has anterior left knee pain without swelling, tenderness, or calf pain. This could be related to forceful restraining during periods of agitation while sedated. The patient's musculoskeletal system examination is otherwise unremarkable.

Laboratory results show a slight improvement in hemoglobin (Hct) levels, ruling out iron deficiency, rect"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2161**] (LIMA to
   LAD, SVG to PDA, OM and Diagonal), PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia here with
   STEMI s/p acromioplasty
   # Cardiogenic shock and STEMI:
   - BPs continue to stabilize, hemodynamically stable with no episodes of
   hypotension.
   - continue ASA 325, plavix 600, SQ heparin, simvastatin 80, metoprolol
   12.5 mg PO BID
   - Increase lisinopril to 10 mg PO daily
   # Cards Pump: Met diuresis goal of -1L yesterday to 20 mg lasix x2 but
   failed to put out urine without foley
   - Cre bump 1.2 - 1.5
   - Clinically euvolemic, resp status continuing to improve on O2 by NC.
   - Goal even today.
   # RHYTHM: NSR with rate 80s.
   # Resp Failure: Pt with increased WOB and crackles. Significantly
   improved, now 95-97% on 2L NC.
   - repeat CXR
   - diuresis as above pending volume status and CXR
   - finished abx course for aspiration, remains afebrile
   - incentive spirometry
   #Anemia: Slightly improved from yesterday, Hct 31.1. No iron
   deficiency, no rectal blood loss, no hemolysis. Will trend.
   #N/V: remains constipated and likely needs aggressive bowel regimen
   - Fleet enema today, Zofran PRN; follow clinically
   # Acid/Base: Acidemia has resolved, but Alkalemic yesterday pH
   7.48/36/143, suggestive of respiratory alkalosis.
   - ABG today to trend acid/base status
   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3 - now 1.5. Likely r/t aggressive diuresis
   - hold diuresis for now, trend creatinine and lytes, renally dose meds
   - if cont [**Month (only) 202**] urine output will bolus IVF
   # s/p shoulder surgery - pain control w fentanyl bolus prn.
   - will schedule f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 413**] for [**5-10**]
   - per ortho: ROM as tolerated, WB < 5 lbs, sling until [**5-10**]
   # Ulcerative colitis: all guaiacs negative. continue asacol 1600 [**Hospital1 **]
   # depression: celexa
   # hx of GERD: use H2 blocker instead of PPI since plavix
   FEN: tolerating POs; replete electrolytes as needed
   ACCESS: PIVs
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx: SC heparin
   -Pain management with fentanyl PRN
   -Bowel regimen with senna/colace, with reglan, dulcolax as needed

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented with cardiogenic shock and acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) after undergoing acromioplasty surgery.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure ranging from 129/58 mmHg to 155/77 mmHg, heart rate between 73-94 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and able to tolerate sitting in a chair with assistance.

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly improved hematocrit level of 31.6%. Other lab values are within normal ranges, except for an elevated troponin-T level of 15.28, indicating myocardial injury. The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.2 to 1.5, possibly due to aggressive diuresis.

Plan:

1. Cardiogenic Shock and STEMI:
   - Continue current medications, including aspirin, Plavix, heparin, simvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.
   - Increase lisinopril dosage to 10 mg PO daily.

2. Fluid Management:
   - Continue diuresis goal of -1 L"
