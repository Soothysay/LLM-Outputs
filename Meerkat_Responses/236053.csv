   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 NASAL SWAB - At [**2192-12-14**] 01:28 PM
   [**12-14**]
   - Hct 34.5 --> 27.9 --> 1u PRBC's --> 34.5
   - GI bleed study --> f/u
   - High bp's to 180's-190's overnight. Given 20mg IV Lasix. Called at MN
   to reassess. BP's still in 180's. Pt had been given 1.5L NS in the ED,
   got blood products, and was getting Golytely prep, and only -100cc's
   negative at MN. So, if 3am and still HTN, wrote for 20mg IV Lasix x1.
   - Getting prepped for c-scope in the am, called by nurse who said she
   is not clearing well, had to be manually disimpacted and nowhere near
   clear. Continuing prep and need to contact GI in am.

   Assessment and Plan:
   [**Age over 90 212**]F with CAD, diastolic CHF, history of LGIB due to sigmoid ulcer and
   telangectasia, presenting with BRBPR.
   1. BRBPR--GI plans to take to colonoscopy today but pt has not cleared
   with Golytely. Continue aggressive prep PO today as pt refuses NGT.
   Touch base with GI and make plan for pt.  Keep active T&S, and has
   units crossmatched. Consider Lasix with transfusions. Has 2 large bore
   PIV's. Hold ASA and Plavix. Avoid hypotension, keep bp's 140-160.
   Deferring surgical consult as pt doesn't want surgery, if no other
   resort, would make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].
   2. HTN--PT seen to have rising bp's through yesterday to 180-190's.
   Given 20mg IV Lasix yesterday and reasonable to diuresis gently some
   more, as pt has gotten IVF's and is net positive since coming here. Has
   h/o CHF so need to keep her negative or even. Assess later and give
   Lasix if necessary.
   3. CAD.  s/p multiple BMS placements in the past.  Maintained on ASA
   and plavix.
   - Hold ASA and plavix for now, as no new or drug eluting stents in
   place.  Consider platelet transfusion.
   - Continue statin.
   4. Afib.  Paroxysmal, currently in sinus.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   - No coumadin.
   5. Diastolic CHF.  Preserved EF, some PA HTN.
   - Watch respiratory status with transfusions, IV lasix prn.
   - Hold PO lasix for now, will give IV if/when needed.
   - Not on BB or anti-HTNs.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly woman with a history of cardiovascular disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to a sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. She presented with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/49-195/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. She is receiving various medications including furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and amiodarone. The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's age and underlying conditions increase the risk of impaired skin integrity.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of LGIB and current presentation with BRBPR indicate a potential ongoing gastrointestinal bleed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypertension, and there is a concern about avoiding hypotension, especially during transfusions.
4. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's history of diastolic CHF and current presentation may worsen her"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Overnight she was prepped for colonoscopy, though appears to still need
   manual disimpaction.   Hct stable after 1U PRBC.
   VS notable for hypertension.  Exam notable for soft abdomen; her mental
   status is poor  -  awake, and alert, but not responding to questions
   reportedly baseline.
   Labs notable for Hct as above, Cr 0.8
   Will need to discuss with GI timing of colonoscopy, need for reprep.
   If Hct and hemodynamics remain stable, would consider transfer to
   floor.

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. She presented with bloody rectal bleeding and was found to have a hematocrit of 34.5, which decreased to 27.9 after bleeding. She received one unit of packed red blood cells and is currently stable with a hematocrit of 34.5.

The patient also has high blood pressure, ranging from 180s to 190s, and was given 20 mg IV Lasix. She is being closely monitored for any changes in blood pressure. She is also on IV fluids and receiving aggressive bowel preparation for a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy is pending clearance of her bowel.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She is currently on amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation and will continue to be monitored. She has preserved ejection fraction with some pulmonary artery hypertension.

The patient has impaired skin integrity and gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to her history of LGIB. She has been assessed by the gastroenterology team, and plans are in place to proceed with a colonoscopy. Her code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently receiving ICU care with appropriate prophylactic measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of her gastrointestinal bleeding, development"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan:
   96F with CAD, diastolic CHF, history of LGIB due to sigmoid ulcer and
   telangectasia, presenting with BRBPR. Pt
s HCT has been stable, no
   evidence of active bleeding.
   1. BRBPR
GI deferring on colonoscopy given that patient still not
   clear, also no current signs of active bleeding. Daughter is amenable
   to this plan. Deferring surgical consult as pt doesn't want surgery.
   Patient could easily rebleed, but no signs of active bleeding. Does not
   want surgery or other invasive measures. Will go home on aspirin, which
   she has not been getting in hospital, but will hold plavix x1 week.
   Daughter will monitor for signs of bleeding.
   -Hold plavix for one week, follow up with PCP
   2. HTN--PT seen to have rising bp's through yesterday to 200s. Given
   20mg IV Lasix yesterday and reasonable to diuresis gently some more, as
   pt has gotten IVF's and is net positive since coming here (LOS +2.5L).
   Has h/o CHF so need to keep her negative or even. Will give Lasix today
   with a goal of negative today to improve overall LOS fluid balance.
   Also given lopressor IV & PO with some response. Per daughter, patient
   is not hypertensive at home.
   -Recheck blood pressures at home
   -Will follow up with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 10849**] 1 week, start antihypertensives if
   continues hypertensive.
   3. Skin breakdown: patient appears to have significant skin breakdown
   on buttocks after receiving prep. Apparently had some ulceration prior
   to prep (stage III on arrival).
   -Daughter requesting help with wound care, [**Name Initial (PRE) **] services at home/
   4. CAD.  s/p multiple BMS placements in the past.  Maintained on ASA
   and plavix.
   - Hold plavix given that no new or drug eluting stents in place. Hold
   x1 week.
   - Continue statin.
   -Restart ASA at home
   5. Afib.  Paroxysmal, currently in sinus.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   - No coumadin.
   6. Diastolic CHF.  Preserved EF, some PA HTN.
   - restart home dose of lasix
   - Not on BB or anti-HTNs.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI IV

   [**Name2 (NI) **]osition: home with Daughter today, [**Name2 (NI) **] services for wound care
","The patient is a 96-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) due to a sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. She presented with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has been stable, indicating no evidence of active bleeding. 

The patient's current condition includes hypertension (HTN), impaired skin integrity, and potential gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Plan:
1. Delay colonoscopy as the patient's stool is still loose but not clear. The daughter is at the bedside and wants to stay until the patient's stool is clear.
2. Manage hypertension by giving Lasix IV and PO with some response. The patient's blood pressure was in the 200s yesterday, so gentle diuresis will be continued to improve overall fluid balance.
3. Address skin breakdown on the buttocks, which appears to be significant. The patient had some ulceration prior to the preparation. The daughter is requesting help with wound care.
4. Manage CAD by holding Plavix for one week since there are no new or drug-eluting stents in place. Continue statin therapy and restart aspirin at home.
5. Manage atrial fibrillation by continuing amiodarone and not initiating coumadin.
6. Restart home dose of Lasix for diastolic CHF.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 96-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) due to a sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. She presented with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) but no evidence of active bleeding.
- The patient's blood pressure has been consistently high throughout the day, reaching 200s. She received 20mg IV Lasix yesterday and will receive more today to achieve a negative fluid balance and improve overall length of stay (LOS) fluid balance.
- The patient has severe skin breakdown on her buttocks after receiving a bowel preparation, with prior ulceration present upon arrival.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/50 to 215/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 35.9%, platelet count of 326 K/uL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, glucose of 92 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient's assessment and plan include managing hypertension, impaired skin integrity, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is being discharged home with her daughter, who will provide wound care services.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Rebleeding: The patient has a history of LGIB, and despite the lack of current signs of active bleeding, there is a risk of rebleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite treatment with Lasix, indicating the need for further management to prevent hypotension.
3. Wound infection: The severe skin breakdown on the patient's buttocks increases the risk of wound infection, especially if not properly managed with wound care.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a net positive fluid balance since coming to the ICU, which needs to be addressed to prevent fluid overload and associated complications.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is on the lower end of normal, indicating a potential risk for hypoglycemia if not monitored and managed appropriately.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, indicating the need for close monitoring and possible intervention to prevent complications related to electrolyte imbalances.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's well-being."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan:
   96F with CAD, diastolic CHF, history of LGIB due to sigmoid ulcer and
   telangectasia, presenting with BRBPR.
   1. BRBPR--GI plans to take to colonoscopy today but pt has not cleared
   with Golytely, got 1L yesterday evening. Will discuss with daughter as
   she seems to be wanting less aggressive measures, unclear if she would
   like colonoscopy today. Touch base with GI and make plan for pt.  Keep
   active T&S, and has units crossmatched. Consider Lasix with
   transfusions. Has 2 large bore PIV's. Hold ASA and Plavix. Avoid
   hypotension, keep bp's 140-160. Deferring surgical consult as pt
   doesn't want surgery, if no other resort, would make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].
   2. HTN--PT seen to have rising bp's through yesterday to 200s. Given
   20mg IV Lasix yesterday and reasonable to diuresis gently some more, as
   pt has gotten IVF's and is net positive since coming here (LOS +2.5L).
   Has h/o CHF so need to keep her negative or even. Will give Lasix today
   with a goal of negative today to improve overall LOS fluid balance.
   Also given lopressor IV with some response.
   -Lasix 20mg IV now, reassess later will probably need another 20mg IV
   given that she has not been negative with 20 mg IV yesterday
   -Consider home medication regimen, may want to add beta blocker or HCTZ
   3. Skin breakdown: patient appears to have significant skin breakdown
   on buttocks after receiving prep. Apparently had some ulceration prior
   to prep, but worse now.
   -Wound care consult
   4. CAD.  s/p multiple BMS placements in the past.  Maintained on ASA
   and plavix.
   - Hold ASA and plavix for now, as no new or drug eluting stents in
   place.  Consider platelet transfusion.
   - Continue statin.
   5. Afib.  Paroxysmal, currently in sinus.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   - No coumadin.
   6. Diastolic CHF.  Preserved EF, some PA HTN.
   - Watch respiratory status with transfusions, IV lasix prn.
   - Hold PO lasix for now, will give IV if/when needed.
   - Not on BB or anti-HTNs.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI IV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 96-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. She presented with blood pressure readings in the 200s and had an episode of bradycardic responsive blood pressure regulation (BRBPR). The patient has not been adequately prepped for a colonoscopy and has delayed until tomorrow. Her daughter is at her bedside and is upset that she was not aware the patient was not stooling clearly until this morning. The patient received 20 mg IV Lasix yesterday and had loose stools but not completely clear. The daughter does not want a colonoscopy, worried that it is too aggressive. The patient also received pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:45 AM, furosemide (Lasix) at 12:30 PM, and metoprolol at 08:02 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has severe ulcerated buttocks with blistering, indicating impaired skin integrity. This can lead to increased risk of infection and potential complications such as cellulitis or pressure ulcers.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of LGIB due to sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. Her current symptoms of BRBPR suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This can result in hypotension, an"
