   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   .
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.  CT
   scan with left perinephric fat stranding and asymmetrical enlargement
   with a small amount of free fluid is seen in the left paracolic
   gutter.  UA positive for infection.  No evidence for other abdominal
   infection, CXR without infiltrate.
   - Continue with broad spectrum antibiotics.  She received vancomycin
   and unasyn in the ED, however UCx from [**11-13**] showed E. coli resistent
   to Unasyn, Bactrim.  Will treat with Cipro, Vanco until further
   sensitivities are obtained.
   - Follow micro data: urine, blood and stool cultures
   - Possible adrenal insufficiency.  Stress dose steroids.  Was given
   hydrocortisone on admission to ICU.  Will change to dexamethasone and
   check cosyntropin test
   - Levophed to maintain MAP to goal >60.  If second [**Doctor Last Name **] required will
   choose Vasopressin, however if sVO2 is low consider dobutamine.
   - Keep CVP between >12
   - Low svO2 on bedside monitoring.  Concern for cardiac contribution to
   current picture - check echocardiogram and trend cardiac enzymes.
   - Central access obtained and confirmed on CXR.  Early goal directed
   therapy with IVF as tolerated.
   - Trend lactate, bands on CBC.  Monitor fever curve and treat with
   acetaminophen
   - Holding oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan, HCTZ
   - Check amylase, lipase to rule out pancreatitis
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Occurred in ED during fever, rigors.  No
   underlying lung pathology although now CXR is fluid overloaded.
   Intubated in the ED for airway protection given altered mental status.
   Hypotensive on propofol.
   - Wean vent as above overnight.
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - Versed/Fentanyl for sedation.  Hold further propofol.
   - Repeat CXR in the AM.
   - Check RSBI in the morning.
   - Once patient is no longer hypotensive, ie improving from a septic
   standpoint, will diurese and extubate as soon as possible.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology
   - Hydrate as above.  Trend creatinine
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   - As patient is septic will give insulin gtt with q1H finger sticks.
   - No gap on chemistry, but continue to monitor.  Will restart standing
   insulin 70U once improved hemodynamically.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Continue outpatient regimen.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 339**] is a 58-year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD. She presents with sepsis likely from pyelonephritis. The patient has bandemia, fevers, hypotension, and CT scan findings consistent with pyelonephritis. She is currently intubated for airway protection and sedated. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Cipro and Vancomycin) and receiving supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
2. Possible adrenal insufficiency. Stress dose steroids have been given.
3. Low systemic vascular resistance (svO2) on bedside monitoring, concern for cardiac contribution to the current picture.
4. Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of DM2, and ketones were noted on initial UA.
6. Respiratory distress: Occurred in the ED during fever and rigors.
7. Possible central nervous system (CNS) involvement: The patient is sedated and has altered mental status.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: Heparin sub-q has been initiated.

1. Urosepsis: The patient has signs of urosepsis, which is a serious infection that can lead to organ failure and septic shock.
2. Pyelonephritis: The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings suggest pyelonephritis, which is a type of urinary tract infection that has spread to the kidneys.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress in the emergency department and is currently intubated. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient may develop acute renal failure, especially if the sepsis progresses or if fluid balance is not properly managed.
5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of DM2 and was found to have ketones on initial urine analysis. There is a risk of"

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock, likely caused by pyelonephritis/urosepsis. She received 6 liters of intravenous fluids, unasyn (history of unasyn-resistant UTI), dexamethasone in the emergency department, and cipro/vanco in the MICU. The patient has GNR bacteremia. She was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 102.6°F, blood pressure of 131/70 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 24 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 190. Her laboratory tests reveal elevated white blood cell count (WBC), high glucose levels, and elevated troponin T. Imaging shows a retrocardiac opacity, and microbiology confirms GNR bacteria in the urine and blood. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide history. She has received multiple infusions, including midazolam, insulin, and fentanyl.

   scan with left perinephric fat stranding and asymmetrical enlargement
   with a small amount of free fluid is seen in the left paracolic
   gutter.  UA positive for infection.  No evidence for other abdominal
   infection. Now growing GNRs in urine and blood. CXR with ? new
   retrocardiac opacity but likely atelectasis.
   - Discontinue vanco as growing GNRs.
   - Continue with Cipro for GNR coverage

   .
   # Respiratory distress: Occurred in ED during fever, rigors.  Minimal
   fluid overload on cxr. Now with metabolic acidosis. Will keep intubated
   until acidosis improves. Consider SBT later today if acidosis
   improving.
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - Versed/Fentanyl for sedation.  Hold further propofol as patient
   became hypotensive.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient presents with sepsis likely from pyelonephritis. 

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension. Growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in urine and blood. Chest X-ray shows a new retrocardiac opacity but likely atelectasis. The patient's temperature is still spiking and white blood cell (WBC) count is climbing. Cefepime has been added to the coverage.
2. Respiratory distress: Occurred in the emergency department during fever and rigors. Minimal fluid overload on chest X-ray. Attempted extubation yesterday but the patient's mental status altered. Required versed and fentanyl overnight. Will attempt morning wake-up and extubation.
3. Altered mental status: Likely secondary to benzodiazepines or septic encephalopathy. No obvious focal deficits and CT head on admission negative.
4. Elevated creatine kinase (CK): Likely rhabdomyolysis secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission).
5. Acute renal failure: Likely preren"

   Resp failure. Intubated in setting of acute septic shock, mental status
   changes. Doing well on PEEP 0, PS 5. Excellent mechanics. Extubation
   hinging on mental status.
   Mental status issues. Awake but inattentive, does not follow commands,
   mildly agitated. Responds poorly to propofol. Diff dx of delerium:
   deleriogenic sedatives (versed), sepsis, possible ingestion prior to
   admission (outpt med list does not suggest culprit). Plan Haldol now
   and fentanyl boluses if necessary and trial of extubation in a couple
   of hours.
   Urosepsis. Cefipime/cipro.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and hypertension admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and shock. She is currently intubated due to acute respiratory failure and mental status changes. She has a history of allergies to Lisinopril, Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim, and Metronidazole. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 147/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 0 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.9 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated lactate levels. Blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient is being treated with cefipime and ciprofloxacin for urosepsis. 

The patient's recent events include difficulty with sedation, poor response to fentanyl and propofol, and the addition of versed. She had a spike in temperature last night, prompting the addition of cefipime. 

The patient's physical examination findings include scleral edema, clear breath"

   deleriogenic sedatives (versed), sepsis, possible ingestion prior to
   admission (outpt med list does not suggest culprit). Plan Haldol now
   and fentanyl boluses if necessary and trial of extubation in a couple
   of hours. If she remains agitated despite haldol and fentanyl will try
   dexmedetomidine.
   Urosepsis. Cefipime/cipro.

   Imaging: CT HEAD:There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is no
   evidence of
   major vascular territorial infarct. There is no edema, shift of
   normally
   midline structures, or effacement of basilar cisterns. The [**Doctor Last Name 734**]-white
   matter
   differentiation is preserved.
   There is no fracture. There has been interval increase in soft tissue
   swelling of the nasopharynx, likely related to prolonged intubation.
   Small
   air-fluid level is noted in the sphenoid sinuses. The other sinuses
   remain
   well aerated.
   IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of vascular
   territorial
   infarcts.
   CT CHEST:Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated
   atelectasis,
   redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, perihilar opacities and
   cardiomegaly
   are all consistent with moderate heart failure/fluid overload. No focal
   consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
   Microbiology: CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   This organism may develop resistance to third generation cephalosporins
   during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates that are initially
   susceptible may become resistant within three to
   four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious infections, repeat
   culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted if third
   generation cephalosporins were used.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive
   - Continue with Cipro and Cefepime for GNR coverage
   - Follow micro data: urine, blood and stool cultures
   - Keep CVP between >12
   - Trend lactate, bands on CBC.  Lactate improved.
   - Monitor fever curve and treat with acetaminophen
   - Holding oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan, HCTZ
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Attempted extubation yesterday but patient
   mental status altered, bp elevated to 220 and tachycardic. Sats dropped
   on ABG with p02 of 60. Reintubated. Persistently agitated on
   dexmedetomidine. Underwent CT chest with evidene of pulmonary edema.
   - diuresis as bp tolerates- goal 1L negative
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - SBT and possible extubation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to benzos or septic
   encephalopathy. No obvious focal deficits  and CT head on admission
   negative. Yesterday continued to be agitated and switched sedation to
   dexmedetomidine which resulted in refractory hypotension despite max
   dose of levophed and neo. D/c'd dexmedetomidine but patient still
   agitated on vent. Therefore had to restart versed while intubated. Had
   CT head that was again negative.
   - continue daily wakeups and SBT with plan for extubation
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely rhabdo secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte
   abnormalities ( ie hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also
   possible component of demand ischemia given elevated troponin but
   minimal MB fraction. CK now trending down
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology. Bumped to 1.3. Very
   hypotensive yesterday requiring fluid boluses and pressors.
   -  Trend creatinine
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   .
   - No gap on chemistry, but continue to monitor.
   - On glargine 55U plus RISS
   .
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation
   - transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - D/c statin given high CKs
   .
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   #FEN
   - start D5
; consider tube feeds
   - IVF bolus to maintain CVP >12
   - replete lytes PRN
   #ACCESS: PIV x3, subclavian line

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She presents with sepsis likely from pyelonephritis. The patient has bandemia, fevers, and hypotension. Citrobacter freundii complex is growing in the urine, and blood cultures are pending species identification.

Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient has signs of urosepsis, which is a severe infection caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream through the urinary tract. This can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress during attempted extubation, indicating possible pulmonary edema and difficulty breathing.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to sedation or septic encephalopathy. No obvious focal deficits are present, and CT head results are negative.
4. Elevated CK: The patient has an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level, indicating possible rhabdomyolysis secondary to sepsis, electrolyte abnormalities, or demand ischemia.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by prerenal etiology due to hypotension.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease.

   Imaging: CT HEAD:There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is no
   evidence of
   major vascular territorial infarct. There is no edema, shift of
   normally
   midline structures, or effacement of basilar cisterns. The [**Doctor Last Name 734**]-white
   matter
   differentiation is preserved.
   There is no fracture. There has been interval increase in soft tissue
   swelling of the nasopharynx, likely related to prolonged intubation.
   Small
   air-fluid level is noted in the sphenoid sinuses. The other sinuses
   remain
   well aerated.
   IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of vascular
   territorial
   infarcts.
   CT CHEST:Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated
   atelectasis,
   redistribution of pulmonary vasculature, perihilar opacities and
   cardiomegaly
   are all consistent with moderate heart failure/fluid overload. No focal
   consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
   Microbiology: CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   This organism may develop resistance to third generation cephalosporins
   during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates that are initially
   susceptible may become resistant within three to
   four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious infections, repeat
   culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted if third
   generation cephalosporins were used.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   - Continue with Cipro
   - D/c cefepime
   - Follow micro data: urine, blood and stool cultures
   - Keep CVP between >12
   - Trend lactate, bands on CBC.  Lactate improved.
   - Monitor fever curve and treat with acetaminophen
   - Holding oral antihypertensive agents - Diovan, HCTZ
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Attempted extubation yesterday but patient
   mental status altered, bp elevated to 220 and tachycardic. Sats
   dropped. ABG with p02 of 60. Reintubated. Persistently agitated on
   dexmedetomidine. Underwent CT chest with evidence of pulmonary edema.
   Likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema given known history of
   diastolic dysfunction. Also possibly due to upper airway obstruction.
   - diuresis as bp tolerates- goal 1L negative
   - Mouth care, HOB elevation, daily wake up
   - SBT on 0/0 and possible extubation
   - Give heliox and racemic epi if develops upper airway obstruction on
   subsequent extubation
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Likely secondary to benzos or septic
   encephalopathy. No obvious focal deficits  and CT head on admission
   negative. Yesterday continued to be agitated and switched sedation to
   dexmedetomidine which resulted in refractory hypotension despite max
   dose of levophed and neo. D/c'd dexmedetomidine but patient still
   agitated on vent. Therefore had to restart versed while intubated. Had
   CT head that was again negative.
   - Attempt propofol for sedation
   - avoid benzos
   - continue daily wakeups and SBT with plan for extubation
   .
   # Elevated CK: Likely rhabdo secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte
   abnormalities ( ie hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also
   possible component of demand ischemia given elevated troponin but
   minimal MB fraction. CK now trending down
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal etiology. Bumped to 1.3. Very
   hypotensive yesterday requiring fluid boluses and pressors.
   -  Trend creatinine
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   .
   - No gap on chemistry, but continue to monitor.
   - On glargine 55U plus RISS
   .
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation
   - transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - D/c statin given high CKs
   .
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   #FEN
   - start D5
; consider tube feeds
   - IVF bolus to maintain CVP >12

","Summary:
Ms. [Last Name] is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis likely due to pyelonephritis. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory distress, altered mental status, elevated creatine kinase (CK), acute renal failure, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, and GERD. She is currently on invasive ventilation and has been reintubated due to respiratory distress. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Citrobacter freundii complex, which may develop resistance to third-generation cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's persistent respiratory distress and requirement for reintubation indicate the need for close monitoring and management of respiratory function. The presence of pulmonary edema on CT chest suggests possible flash pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction or upper airway obstruction.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's agitation and altered mental status could be attributed to benzodiazepines or septic encephalopathy. Daily wakeups and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) are planned for extubation.
3. Elevated CK: The elevated creatine kinase level suggests rhabdomyolysis, which may be secondary to sepsis, electrolyte abnormalities, or demand"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.)  Urosepsis:  Growing GNR from blood and urine.  Urine Cx speciated
   as citrobacter.
             -D/c cefepime, continue cipro for 2 week course
   2.) Resp failure:  Unclear etiology of failure yesterday. Possibilities
   include upper airway obstruction, flash pulmonary edema
   (tachy/hypertensive and LVH on old echo), and agitation.
                        -Changed to PSV again today and SBT on 0/0
                        -Diurese today
                        -Check cuff leak
   3.) Altered Mental status:  Continued agitation overnight on 3 of
   versed.  Currently on 5.  Head CT with no acute change. Likely
   etiologies include septic delirium and medication effect. Status
   epilepticus less likely but possible.
        -Change benzo's to propofol and daily wake-ups
        -If AMS persists, will get EEG.
   4.) Rhabdo:  CPK's now trending down.
   5.)  FEN:  Start TF today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple health issues. They were initially extubated but failed due to tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, wheezing, and agitation. The patient required reintubation. The patient has a fever and is showing signs of infection with a growing GNR (Gram-negative rod) from blood and urine cultures. The urine culture also speciated as Citrobacter. The patient's respiratory function is compromised, with unclear etiology of failure. Possibilities include upper airway obstruction, flash pulmonary edema, and agitation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with PSV (pressure support ventilation) mode and SBT (spontaneous breathing trial) on 0/0. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status with agitation and has been sedated with midazolam (versed). They are currently on 5 mg/hour of versed. A head CT scan showed no acute changes. Likely etiologies for altered mental status include septic delirium and medication effect. Status epilepticus is less likely but possible. The patient's rhabdomyolysis is improving, as indicated by decreasing CPK levels. The patient is starting total parenteral nutrition (TF) today. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   -continue cipro as blood and urine are growing pan sensitive
   citrobacter
   -surveillance cultures negative but continues to be febrile, wbc
   trending downward
   -hemodynamically stable (holding diovan and hctz- home
   antihypertensives)
   -culture if spikes
   # Respiratory distress: failed 1 x attempt at extubation.
   -diuresing well, continue to diurese with goal 1-2 liters today
   -SBT this a.m. with goal for extubation (0/0)
   -sedation is propofol and keeping her well controlled
   -check for cuff leak prior to extubation
   - Give heliox and racemic epi if develops upper airway obstruction on
   subsequent extubation
   # Altered mental status:  if MS still altered would need to rule out
   non convulsive status.
   -currently most likely diagnosis is benzo effect on mental status,
   continue to monitor for improving mental status, if does not clear may
   need to call neuro for EEG to r/o status but very unlikely
   - avoid benzos
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   -lantus last night was held as tube feeds were held
   -give 15 of NPH now and cover with sliding scale, continue qhs lantus
   (can decrease dose to 40 if NPO, 55 if tube feeds or diet have started)
   -RISS
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She presents with sepsis likely from pyelonephritis, as indicated by fever, hypotension, and the presence of citrobacter in her urine culture. The patient also has respiratory distress and failed one attempt at extubation. She requires ongoing diuresis and sedation with propofol. Her mental status is altered, possibly due to benzodiazepine effect, but further evaluation for non-convulsive status is needed. The patient has elevated CK levels, suggesting rhabdomyolysis secondary to sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities. Her acute renal failure has improved, likely pre-renal in origin. Other issues include poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The patient has multiple lines, including PIV x3, L IJ, and art line. She is receiving heparin sub-q for DVT prophylaxis and bowel medications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   -continue cipro as blood and urine are growing pan sensitive
   citrobacter
   -surveillance cultures negative but continues to be febrile, wbc
   trending downward
   -hemodynamically stable (holding diovan and hctz- home
   antihypertensives)
   -culture if spikes
   # Respiratory distress: failed 1 x attempt at extubation.
   -diuresing well, continue to diurese with goal 1-2 liters today
   -SBT this a.m. with goal for extubation (0/0)
   -sedation is propofol and keeping her well controlled
   -check for cuff leak prior to extubation
   - Give heliox and racemic epi if develops upper airway obstruction on
   subsequent extubation
   # Altered mental status:  if MS still altered would need to rule out
   non convulsive status.  Call neuro for EEG.
   -in addition given mental status changes and fevers may be useful to
   obtain an MRI to rule out meningneal enhancement as may increase
   likelihood for menginitis, however given urosepsis and clear pyelo on
   CT this is unlikely
   - avoid benzos
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   -lantus last night was held as tube feeds were held
   -give 15 of NPH now and cover with sliding scale, continue qhs lantus
   (can decrease dose to 40 if NPO, 55 if tube feeds or diet have started)
   -RISS
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation
   - transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - D/c statin given high CKs
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.
   #FEN: tube feeds or diet depending on ability to extubate
   - replete lytes PRN
   #ACCESS: PIV x3, L IJ.  Art Line- dampened
   #PPx
    - Heparin sub-q for DVT prophylaxis
   - replete lytes PRN
   - bowel meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 339] is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She presents with sepsis likely due to pyelonephritis. The patient has been febrile, hypotensive, and experiencing bandemia. Citrobacter has grown in the urine culture, while blood cultures are still pending. The patient's white blood cell count is trending downward, and she remains febrile.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning as she failed an extubation attempt. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 500 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 20, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and an RSBI of 65. Her ABG results show pH 7.38, PaCO2 31, HCO3- 157, BE -5, Ve 9.7 L/min, PaO2/FiO2 ratio 314, and PIP 16 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100%.

The patient's mental status is altered, and there is a concern for non-convulsive status. An EEG has been ordered to evaluate this possibility. Additionally, an MRI has been considered to rule"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 339**] [**Known lastname 3190**] is a 58 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
   hypercholesterolemia, GERD who presents with sepsis likely from
   pyelonephritis.
   # Urosepsis: Pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
   Growing citrobacter in urine. Blood cx not yet speciated- both are
   pansensitive.
   -continue cipro as blood and urine are growing pan sensitive
   citrobacter
   -surveillance cultures negative but continues to be febrile, wbc
   trending downward
   -hemodynamically stable (holding diovan and hctz- home
   antihypertensives)
   -culture if spikes
   # Respiratory distress: failed 1 x attempt at extubation.
   -diuresing well, continue to diurese with goal 1-2 liters today
   -SBT this a.m. with goal for extubation (0/0)
   -sedation is propofol and keeping her well controlled
   -check for cuff leak prior to extubation
   - Give heliox and racemic epi if develops upper airway obstruction on
   subsequent extubation
   # Altered mental status:  if MS still altered would need to rule out
   non convulsive status.
   -currently most likely diagnosis is benzo effect on mental status,
   continue to monitor for improving mental status, if does not clear may
   need to call neuro for EEG to r/o status but very unlikely
   - avoid benzos
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], continue to trend.  Likely rhabdo
   secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie
   hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of
   demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. CK now
   trending down
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   - Keep MAP above 60
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renally dose meds
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Ketones noted on
   initial UA
   -lantus last night was held as tube feeds were held
   -give 15 of NPH now and cover with sliding scale, continue qhs lantus
   (can decrease dose to 40 if NPO, 55 if tube feeds or diet have started)
   -RISS
   # Anemia: Per iron studies, likely both iron deficiency and anemia of
   chronic disease
   - start iron supplementation
   - transfuse for HCT less than 21
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - D/c statin given high CKs
   # GERD:
   - Continue PPI.
   #FEN: tube feeds or diet depending on ability to extubate
   - replete lytes PRN
   #ACCESS: PIV x3, L IJ.  Art Line- dampened
   #PPx
    - Heparin sub-q for DVT prophylaxis
   - replete lytes PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
- The patient presents with sepsis likely due to pyelonephritis.
- She has urosepsis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.
- The urine culture is growing citrobacter, and blood cultures are pending.
- The patient's respiratory distress failed one attempt at extubation.
- She is being closely monitored for any signs of upper airway obstruction.
- The patient's altered mental status may be due to the effect of benzodiazepines or nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
- Her elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels suggest rhabdomyolysis secondary to sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities.
- The patient's acute renal failure has improved, and she is showing signs of pre-renal azotemia.
- Her diabetes mellitus type 2 requires adjustment in medication dosages.
- The patient has anemia, likely due to iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease.
- She has hypercholesterolemia, which needs further evaluation and management.
- GERD should be managed with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
- The patient's nutritional needs should be addressed through tube feeds or diet depending on the ability to extubate.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with complaints of altered mental status (AMS) and urosepsis. The patient has multiple medical conditions and allergies, including an allergy to Lisinopril, Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim, and Metronidazole. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, and normal heart rate and respiratory rate. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a T-piece and has been placed on positive pressure ventilation with a pressure support of 4-11 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% and their ABG results indicate normal oxygenation and ventilation. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally and the absence of peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows the patient to be minimally responsive to verbal stimuli. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Blood cultures from the arterial line and urine cultures have shown no growth. Other lab results are within normal limits or show mild abnormalities.

The patient's current medications include propofol, haloperidol, fentanyl, Lasix, heparin sodium, and other medications. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were cefepime and ciprofloxacin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 339] is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was admitted with altered mental status and sepsis likely from pyelonephritis. The patient's mental status has significantly improved, and she successfully tolerated extubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to sepsis and the effect of benzodiazepines. It is important to avoid further administration of benzodiazepines and continue monitoring the patient's mental status.
2. Urosepsis: The patient has pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension. Citrobacter is growing in the urine culture, and both blood cultures are pansensitive. It is recommended to continue ciprofloxacin as a 14-day course since the bacteria are sensitive to it. Surveillance cultures should be negative, and the patient should be monitored for any changes in condition.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient initially failed extubation but was successfully extubated after showing improvement in mental status. The patient should continue to diuresis well, aiming for 1 liter today. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
4. Elevated CK levels: The patient's creatine kinase (CK)"

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Urosepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis from pyelonephritis, which is a bacterial infection of the kidneys. It is important to continue treatment with antibiotics sensitive to Citrobacter, as indicated by the growing citrobacter in urine and blood cultures.

2. Altered mental status: The patient had altered mental status, likely due to sepsis and benzodiazepine effect. The patient's mental status has significantly improved, so it is recommended to avoid benzodiazepines and continue monitoring.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), which could be secondary to sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. It is important to continue monitoring the CK levels.

   # Altered mental status:  Pt with significantly improved MS. Following
   commands and answering questions appropriately. AMS likely due to
   sepsis and benzodiazepine effect.
   - avoid benzos, continue to monitor
   # Elevated CK: trending [**Last Name (un) 3254**], 300. Likely sepsis and /or
   hypophos/hypokalemia
   # Acute renal failure: improved.   Likely was pre renal.
   # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**].  Received 18U humalog

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She presented with sepsis from pyelonephritis, which has improved, and she was successfully extubated.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Urosepsis: The patient initially had pyelonephritis, which is an infection of the kidneys. This led to sepsis, as indicated by bandemia (increase in immature white blood cells), fevers, and hypotension. Citrobacter was growing in the urine and blood. The patient is being treated with ciprofloxacin, which is sensitive to citrobacter. It is important to continue the antibiotic treatment and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.

2. Altered mental status: The patient had an altered mental status due to sepsis and benzodiazepine effect. With improvement in her condition, her mental status has improved significantly. It is recommended to avoid benzodiazepines and continue monitoring her mental status.

3. Elevated CK: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is elevated, likely due to sepsis and/or hypophosphatemia/hypokalemia. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and cardiac enzymes is necessary to assess for any cardiac complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with pyelonephritis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. She has shown significant improvement in all respects. The patient had a history of dysuria and back pain before admission. She was previously intubated due to respiratory failure but has now been successfully extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient's pyelonephritis is complicated by septic shock and respiratory failure. Although cultures are now negative, the patient still has significant leukocytosis. It is important to continue monitoring her condition and check the differential.
2. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient's DM needs to be restarted with lantus tonight since she is now eating.
3. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's HTN medication should be restarted as per her home regimen.
4. Activity: The patient is currently out of bed (OOB) today. Further activity restrictions may be necessary based on her condition.
5. Rhabdomyolysis (Rhabdo): The patient's CPK levels are nearly normal today, indicating improvement. However, it is important to restart statin therapy.
6. Access: Peripheral lines should be placed, and the temporary central line should be discontinued.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient should be transitioned to a regular oral diet.
- Glycemic Control: Monitoring of blood glucose levels should be continued"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of pyelonephritis, sepsis, and respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU and received invasive ventilation. The patient's mental status cleared, and she was successfully extubated. 

The patient has allergies to Lisinopril, Bactrim DS, and Metronidazole. She had been experiencing back pain and dysuria before admission. The last dose of antibiotics she received was Ciprofloxacin on 05/28/2101 at 08:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 100 bpm (92-115), blood pressure ranging from 170/74 mmHg to 97/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (10-28), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 1,457 mL over 24 hours. She is receiving prophylactic heparin and other ICU medications. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 28.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, platelet count of 266 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 219 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 43 to 219 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated levels of CK, CKMB, troponin-T, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate.

Microbiology results indicate no growth in urine culture, sputum culture, and blood surveillance culture.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for pyelonephritis with ciprofloxacin for 14 days, restarting lantus for diabetes management, restarting home regimen for hypertension, advising out-of-bed activity, monitoring CPK levels for rhabdomyolysis, placing peripherals and discontinuing temporary central line, and transferring to the floor."
