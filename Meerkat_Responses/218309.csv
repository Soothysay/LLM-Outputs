","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease and atrial fibrillation. She underwent an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (decending), and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 148 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/66 to 152/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation. She was not on anticoagulation due to scheduled surgeries but was on diltiazem and metoprolol as part of her home regimen. However, she did not receive oral medications due to being NPO for the procedure. She required large amounts of intravenous medications intraoperatively and postoperatively. The patient's tachycardia may also be affected by pain post-op and likely hypovolemia after surgery. The plan includes continuing diltiazem at 15 mg/hr, starting metoprolol 5 q4, and considering chemical or electrical cardioversion if necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (decending), and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient was not on anticoagulation due to her scheduled surgeries.

The patient required large amounts of intravenous medications intraoperatively and postoperatively. She was placed on a diltiazem drip and lopressor 5 q4h prn to control her heart rate. The patient's blood pressure measurements from the arterial line were consistently lower than noninvasive and manual measurements, so noninvasive measurements were used for therapy guidance.

The patient's lactate level decreased to 1.3, and she received albumin 5% (25g/500mL) bolus. She also received dilaudid PCA and dilaudid IV prn for pain control.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 148 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/66 mmHg to 152/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is awake, alert, and oriented, but mildly lethargic post-procedure.

   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
   She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was was controlled.  However, she was NPO for her procedure and
   did not receive po medications.  She required large amounts of IV meds
   intra-op and post-op.  She was placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].  Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op and likely hypovolemia after
   surgery. Pt is NPO including medications. Note a-line measurements are
   approx 30-40 pts lower than noninvasive and manual measurements
   (initially they were concordant upon hitting floor). CE
s neg x1. Pt
   has required intermittent neo initially for BP support, may have been
   due to faulty BP measurement from a-line.
   - was on PO 180mg dilt SR and 50mg metoprolol TID, then reverted back
   to dilt drip and metop IV 5q6h, once taking Pos can resume PO meds and
   callout to floor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease and atrial fibrillation. She underwent an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient is currently in the ICU due to post-operative complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has a history of difficult-to-control AF and is currently experiencing rapid ventricular response (RVR). She was not on anticoagulation therapy prior to surgery and required large amounts of IV medications intra-operatively and post-operatively. The patient's tachycardia may be affected by pain and hypovolemia after surgery. Continuous monitoring of heart rate and consideration of chemical or electrical cardioversion may be necessary.

2. Abdominal Surgery Complications: The patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh. She has persistent nausea, ileus, and opioids for pain control. There are concerns about her colostomy and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid. It is important to monitor drain output and maintain adequate urine output.

3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea, which is likely due to post-operative ileus and opioids. She has been given Zofran IV prn, ativan"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She presented to the ICU for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after undergoing an abdominoperineal resection with descending end-colostomy and ventral hernia repair.

The patient's current condition includes nausea, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure 138/82 mmHg, heart rate 107 bpm (with a range of 68-125 bpm), respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% on 2L nasal cannula. The patient is alert and complaining of nausea. Physical examination reveals scattered bilateral rales, and she has a binder in place with three jejunal-feeding tubes and an ostomy. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5, hemoglobin of 29%, creatinine of 0.7, and lactate of 1.3. Electrocardiograms (EKGs) have shown inferior-lateral ST segment inversions and runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).

Plan:
1. Management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:
   - Change back to oral diltiazem and standing IV metoprolol.
   - Consider chemical cardioversion with amiodarone or electrical cardioversion if hypotensive.
   - Repeat EKG and continue telemonitoring.
2. Abdominal surgery:
   - Continue NPO including medications for at least 24 hours.
   - Replete electrolytes.
   - Maintain intravenous fluids at 100cc/hr.
   - Monitor drain output and urine output greater than 30cc/hr.
   - Maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) greater than 60.
3. Nausea/Vomiting:
   - Administer Zofran IV as needed, Ativan IV as needed, and Raglan IV as needed.
   - Allow ice chips.
4. Prophylaxis:
   - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): subcutaneous heparin.
   - Stress ulcer: Protonix.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): monitor.
5. Communication:
   - Husband: Dr. [Last Name] at [Telephone/Fax].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation increases the risk of potential complications such as stroke, heart failure, and thromboembolism.
2. Nausea/vomiting: The patient's ongoing nausea may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and poor nutrition, which can impact her recovery and overall health.
3. Surgical site infection: Given the recent abdominal surgery, there is a risk of developing a surgical site infection, which can delay wound healing and lead to further complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and surgery can increase the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of developing VAP, which can worsen respiratory status and require additional interventions.
6. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate level suggests possible organ dysfunction, such as hepatic or renal dysfunction. Monitoring and addressing these functions will be crucial to the patient's recovery.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information. It is important to consult with the patient's healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease and atrial fibrillation. She underwent an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (decending), and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient is currently experiencing several potential medical complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient has a known history of difficult-to-control AF. She was not on anti-coagulation due to scheduled surgeries, but her usual regimen included diltiazem (180mg) and metoprolol (100mg) orally. However, she did not receive her regular medications as she was NPO (nothing by mouth) for the procedure. She required large amounts of IV medications intra-op and post-op. The patient's tachycardia may be affected by post-operative pain and likely hypovolemia after surgery. She is currently on diltiazem through a gastrointestinal tube. The patient's blood pressure measurements are inconsistent between arterial line readings and noninvasive measurements.

2. Abdominal Surgery Complications: The patient had an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (decending), and ventral hernia repair with mesh. She has drains in place, and one of the drains is draining serosanguinous fluid. The nasogastric tube was pulled due to patient discomfort and improper positioning."

   Disposition: ICU until rate controlled, nausea controlled, taking POs
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (decending) and ventral hernia repair with mesh.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Severe nausea and vomiting post-surgery, unresponsive to initial medications
- Failure to place nasogastric tube due to discomfort and improper positioning
- Agitation requiring restraints and administration of haloperidol
- Elevated white blood cell count, likely reactive in the setting of recent surgery
- Tachycardia, likely due to pain and hypovolemia after surgery
- Hypotension requiring intermittent neo for BP support
- A-fib not controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, requiring further management
- Abdominal surgery complications including ileus and opioids use
- Colostomy and JP drains draining serosanguinous fluid
- Obvious pain with palpation in the abdomen

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing it with rapid ventricular response. This may lead to further cardiac issues such as heart failure or thromboembolic events if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, admitted to the ICU for management of atrial fibrillation and pain control. The patient has been experiencing delirium/confusion, nausea/vomiting, and acute chronic pain. He is currently on various medications including diltiazem, lorazepam, midazolam, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and metoprolol. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/91 to 105/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal range. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 1,703 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (24.9 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin (8.1 g/dL), normal platelet count (538 K/uL), and abnormal kidney function (creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL). Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and is being monitored closely for any complications. The patient's condition remains stable but requires ongoing management for pain control, glycemic control, and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall obese female who was admitted to the ICU with the chief complaint of pain and confusion. The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and is experiencing nausea and vomiting. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/91 to 181/132 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is currently on several medications including diltiazem, lorazepam, midazolam, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and metoprolol.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 3,682 mL of fluids and given 5,385 mL of blood products, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1,703 mL. The patient's urine output is 2,960 mL, and the NG tube drainage is 2,000 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, an NG tube in place, and limited cardiovascular examination due to rapid heart rate. The abdominal examination shows colostomy with dark liquid stool and severe pain with palpation. The skin examination is notable for pale complexion and no bruises. The extremity examination reveals pedal pulses"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 52-year-old female with PMH significant for
   Crohn's Disease requiring multiple prior surgeries, atrial fibrillation
   who presents with a-fib w/ RVR after abdominoperineal resection, end
   colostomy (decending) and ventral hernia repeair with mesh.
   .
   #. A-fib w/ RVR: Pt with 10 month history of difficult to control
   a-fib.  She was not on anti-coagulation given her scheduled surgeries.
   She was on 180mg dilt SR and 100mg metoprolol TID po as her home
   regimen was was controlled.  However, she was NPO for her procedure and
   did not receive po medications.  She required large amounts of IV meds
   intra-op and post-op.  She was placed on a dilt gtt in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].  Pt
   tachycardia also affected by pain post-op and likely hypovolemia after
   surgery. Pt is NPO including medications. Note a-line measurements are
   approx 30-40 pts lower than noninvasive and manual measurements
   (initially they were concordant upon hitting floor). CE
s neg x1. Pt
   has required intermittent neo initially for BP support, may have been
   due to faulty BP measurement from a-line.
   - was on PO 180mg dilt SR and 50mg metoprolol TID, then reverted back
   to dilt drip and metop IV 5q6h, once taking Pos can resume PO meds and
   callout to floor
   - patient becomes increasingly hypotensive then consider chemical
   cardioversion with amio or electrical cardioversion
   - repeat ECG
   - cont tele
   .
   #. Abdominal Surgery: abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy
   (decending) and ventral hernia repeair with mesh. Pt being followed by
   surgery. Pt with colostomy and JP drains drining serosang.  Pulled NGT
   due to pt discomfort and improper position (coiled in esoph). Pt still
   has persistent nausea [**3-11**] post-op ileus and opioids.
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Cefazolin for only 24hr per surgery
   - pain control with dilaudid PCA, IV dilaudid prn, toradol 3days
   - nausea: Zofran IV prn, ativan prn, reglan prn
   - NPO including meds, ice chips ok
   - monitor drain output
   - monitor UOP >30cc/hr
   - Maintain MAPS >60
   - IVF bolus and maintenence 100cc/hr
   .
   #. ST depression: Likely demand in the setting of rapid rate.  Pt
   without prior MI or documented CAD.  Pt with risk factors including
   hyperlipidmia and HTN. EF 40-50% on last ECHO. Pt not complaining of
   chest pain.  Likely demand in the setting of rapid rate.  Spoke with
   cards fellow on call and faxed ECG. Diffuse STD and TWI less likely
   coronoary and more likely rate related. CE

   #Leukocytosis: WBC elevated to 24.9 post-op down to 10.5 yesterday, now
   12.1.  Likely reactive in the setting of recent surgery. No bands.  Pt
   does meet SIRS criterea given tachycardia and elevated WBC. Pt is
   afebrile.  No complications during surgery such as bowel perf or other
   complications.  Lactate down to 1.3. Has been afebrile
   - will hold on abx unless spikes or unstable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after undergoing an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient had a difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation prior to the surgery and was not on anticoagulation. She was on diltiazem and metoprolol as her home regimen, but she did not receive oral medications due to being NPO for the procedure. She required large amounts of IV medications intra-op and post-op. The patient experienced tachycardia due to pain post-op and likely hypovolemia after surgery. She is currently NPO including medications. The patient's blood pressure measurements are lower through the arterial line compared to noninvasive and manual measurements. She has required intermittent neo for BP support, which may have been due to faulty BP measurement from the arterial line.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Delirium/confusion - The patient is mildly lethargic post-procedure.
2. Nausea/vomiting - The patient has ongoing nausea related to ileus and opioids.
3. Pain control - The patient requires acute pain management, as well as chronic pain management.
4. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) - The patient has a history of difficult-to-control AF"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease who underwent abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh. She is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is showing signs of confusion and delirium. This could be due to multiple factors such as pain, medication effects, or electrolyte imbalances.

2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient has been experiencing nausea, which may be attributed to her recent surgery, opioid use for pain control, or the presence of the nasogastric tube.

3. Pain Control: The patient requires effective pain management due to acute and chronic pain from her surgeries. Morphine PCA has been ordered for pain control.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a known history of difficult-to-control AFib. Post-operatively, she developed rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was placed on diltiazem. She also received metoprolol IV. It is important to continue monitoring her heart rate and rhythm closely.

5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has an elevated bicarbonate level, likely secondary to the nasogastric tube suction. Aggressive repletion of potassium and monitoring drain output are recommended.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated post-operatively"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She underwent an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (descending), and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient is currently in the ICU due to post-operative complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient has a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation. She was not on anticoagulation prior to surgery, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events. The rapid ventricular response may be due to pain and hypovolemia after surgery. The patient requires close monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels. Cardioversion may be considered if the patient becomes increasingly hypotensive.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient exhibits signs of delirium, as indicated by her altered mental status and disorientation. This could be attributed to the recent surgery, medication side effects, or electrolyte imbalances. It is crucial to ensure adequate pain control, monitor vital signs, administer appropriate medications, and provide regular reorientation.

3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient continues to experience nausea post-operatively, likely due to ileus and opioid use. Medications such as Zofran, Ativan, and Reglan can be used to manage nausea. Monitoring of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and allergies to tetracycline. He underwent surgery and is currently in the ICU. His current complaints include delirium/confusion, nausea/vomiting, and pain control. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/83 to 123/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on various medications including diltiazem, metoprolol, digoxin, and heparin sodium. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated levels of potassium, sodium, and chloride. The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are within normal range. The patient has a history of chronic pain and regional enteritis (Crohn's disease). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which could be due to several factors such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or the post-operative state.
2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient is also experiencing nausea and vomiting, which can be caused by medications, gastrointestinal issues, or as a side effect of anesthesia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient was not on anticoagulation due to scheduled surgeries. She was on diltiazem SR and metoprolol TID po as her home regimen, but did not receive po medications due to being NPO for the procedure. She required large amounts of IV medications intra-op and post-op. She was placed on a dilt gtt in the [Hospital Unit Name 1]. The patient's heart rate is under better control at 90-100s on the current regimen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient has a history of difficult-to-control AFib and was not on anticoagulation prior to surgery. The rapid heart rate may be affected by pain post-op and likely hypovolemia after surgery. The patient is NPO including medications. Digoxin has been loaded, and the patient is on metoprolol IV q4h. The diltiazem drip has been discontinued, and telemetry is continued. Call out if HR <115.

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion

s note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care. Mrs [**Known lastname 669**] is previously known to
   me. She is doing well from a post op surgical belly point of view.  Her
   stay in the MICU is for her Afib with RVR, accompanied by EKG ST
   changes which have resolved.  Her rate control is improved with the
   start of digoxin in rather low dose, along with Metoprolol and a
   Diltiazem drip.  The last of these is only at 5mg/hr and with a HR of
   100 we will stop the Dilt and observe the patient.  If her HR stays
   below 120 we feel she can be transferred to the surgical floor on Dig
   and Metoprolol.  Once taking po
s she can be transitioned to her prior
   Afib regimen of meds.  Surgical team has rounded on her and has
   discussed her case with us.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She underwent an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (decending), and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post-operatively. She has been receiving medications for rate control, including metoprolol and digoxin, as well as a diltiazem drip, which has been decreased to 5mg/hr. The patient's nausea is under better control, and she is able to tolerate sitting in a chair. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR) - The patient's history of difficult-to-control AFib, recent surgery, and post-operative pain and hypovolemia contribute to the development of AFib w/RVR. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is necessary.
2. Delirium/confusion - The patient's altered mental status may be due to post-operative factors, medication effects, or electrolyte imbalances. Frequent assessments of mental status and neurologic examination are required.
3. Nausea/vomiting - The patient continues to experience nausea, likely due to post-operative ileus, opioid use, and other factors. Antiemetic medications and advancing to oral intake gradually may help alleviate symptoms.
4. Surgical site infection -"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple prior surgeries. She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after undergoing an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient had a difficult time controlling her atrial fibrillation, as she was not on anti-coagulation due to scheduled surgeries. She was previously taking diltiazem and metoprolol orally, but she was NPO for the procedure and did not receive any oral medications. Postoperatively, she required large amounts of IV medications. She was placed on a diltiazem drip and metoprolol IV every 6 hours. The patient experienced tachycardia, which could be attributed to pain and hypovolemia following surgery. Her blood pressure measurements from the arterial line were approximately 30-40 points lower than noninvasive and manual measurements. She required intermittent neo for blood pressure support, possibly due to faulty blood pressure measurement from the arterial line. The patient was on PO diltiazem 180mg SR and 50mg metoprolol TID, then reverted back to diltiazem drip and metoprolol IV every 5q6h, once taking PO can resume PO meds and call out to floor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease and atrial fibrillation. She presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response post-abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (descending), and ventral hernia repair with mesh. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which may be due to various factors such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or post-operative complications.
2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which could be related to the abdominal surgery, medication side effects, or electrolyte imbalances.
3. Pain Control: The patient requires pain control for both acute and chronic pain related to the recent surgery and pre-existing Crohn's disease.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing this condition with rapid ventricular response. She is being treated with medications such as digoxin, diltiazem, and metoprolol.
5. Abdominal Surgery Complications: The patient recently underwent multiple abdominal surgeries, including abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (descending), and ventral hernia repair with mesh. She may have complications related to these procedures, such as infection, bleeding, or poor wound"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history significant for Crohn's disease and atrial fibrillation. She presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response after undergoing an abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy (descending), and ventral hernia repair with mesh.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications that require attention:

1. Delirium/confusion: The patient is showing signs of confusion and delirium. Further assessment and management are necessary to address this issue.

2. Nausea/vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to her recent abdominal surgery or other underlying factors. Appropriate medications such as Zofran and Reglan should be continued to manage these symptoms.

3. Pain control: The patient requires effective pain management due to acute and chronic pain from her surgeries. Morphine PCA can be used for pain control, considering her current condition.

4. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, and it has been present postoperatively. The current treatment regimen includes digoxin, IV metoprolol, and IV diltiazem. These medications should be continued, and digoxin levels should be monitored.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, atrial fibrillation, and multiple surgeries. She presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response following abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which may be due to the recent surgery, medications, or underlying medical conditions.
2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, likely related to the surgery and pain management.
3. Pain Control: The patient requires effective pain control due to acute and chronic pain from the surgery.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which is currently uncontrolled. She is on digoxin, IV dosing of diltiazem, and metoprolol. The goal is to achieve rate control and possibly consider rhythm control strategies.
5. Crohn's Disease: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease with multiple surgeries and complications. She is not currently taking mesalamine due to being on NPO status post-surgery.
6. Abdominal Surgery: The patient recently underwent abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh. She has drains draining serosanguinous fluid and requires monitoring of drain output and urine output.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is likely reactive due to the recent surgery. There are no signs of infection at present.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient is on various prophylactic measures including stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her AFib, pain control, nutrition, glycemic control, and ongoing assessment of her surgical wounds and drains."

- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and Crohn's disease.
- She underwent multiple surgeries including abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh.
- Post-surgery, the patient experienced rapid ventricular response (RVR) due to AFib and was transferred back to the ICU for better management.
- Medications: The patient is currently on diltiazem 90mg qid and metoprolol 100mg tid through the nasogastric (NG) tube, with metoprolol 10mg IV given as needed for breakthrough symptoms. She is also taking PO diltiazem 90mg qid and PO metoprolol 100mg tid, with a hold on anti-coagulation due to recent surgery.
- The patient has a colostomy and is draining serosanguenous fluid from JP drains. Pain control measures include morphine PCA, zofran, and reglan for nausea. She is NPO except for medications and is being monitored for drain output and urine output >30cc/hr.
- IV fluids are maintained with lactated Ringer's solution at 80cc/hr. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is being maintained above 60mmHg.

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, Crohn's disease, and multiple prior surgeries. She was transferred to the ICU from surgery due to uncontrolled rate of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response following abdominoperineal resection, end colostomy, and ventral hernia repair with mesh.

The patient's current medications include diltiazem 90mg qid through the nasogastric (NG) tube, metoprolol 100mg tid through the NG tube, and metoprolol 10mg IV per nasogastric as needed. She is also on digoxin 0.25mg IV and her home regimen of diltiazem 180mg sustained-release (SR) and metoprolol 100mg three times daily orally (PO).

The patient has a colostomy and is draining serosanguenous fluid from her joint drains. Her pain is being controlled with morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and she is receiving antiemetic medications like ondansetron (Zofran) and risperidone (Reglan) for nausea. She is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) except for medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 137/118 to 123/63 mmHg, respiratory"
