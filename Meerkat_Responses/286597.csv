","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), nephrolithiasis, and presumed tuberculosis (TB) pleurisy treated 30 years ago. The patient presented with epigastric pain and was found to have ST-elevation on EKG, leading to cardiac catheterization which revealed no significant disease. The patient was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis.

The patient has been experiencing fever, low blood pressures, and bandemia. Blood cultures showed GNR bacteremia, but the source is unclear. Lactate levels are elevated, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, suggesting a component of mild shock liver due to sepsis.

An RUQ ultrasound was performed, which showed no acute processes. Empiric antibiotics have been started to cover gastrointestinal pathogens. The patient's baseline blood pressure is around 110s systolic, and he continues to receive IV fluids as needed to maintain adequate urine output.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, with some mild bump for possible ischemic component. An echocardiogram today showed anterolateral wall motion abnormality possibly seen on cath yesterday. The patient will continue on baby aspirin and discontinue Plavix.

There is a question of possible Brugada pattern on ECG per cardiology team. The patient's A1C level is"

He presented with epigastric pain and was found to have STE on EKG. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed no significant disease, and was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis. The patient continues to have bandemia and low-grade temperatures. Blood pressures remain low (baseline SBP 80s). LFTs are improving, possibly due to mild shock liver in the setting of sepsis. A RUQ ultrasound was within normal limits for cholangitis vs. abscess. The patient has GNR bacteremia, but the source is unclear. Empiric levofloxacin and zosyn are being administered to cover GI pathogens, and vancomycin will be discontinued.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, and there is a risk of deterioration if the infection does not improve or spreads to other organs.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, indicating possible liver dysfunction. Close monitoring of liver enzymes and liver function is necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures remain low (baseline SBP 80s), which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with epigastric pain and was found to have ST-elevation on EKG. He was taken to the cath lab, where no significant disease was found, and then transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis. The patient has elevated transaminases, fever, and bandemia, indicating a possible sepsis or infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and bandemia, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection.

2. Organ dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes suggest liver dysfunction, which could potentially progress to acute liver failure if not treated promptly.

3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is receiving prophylactic DVT (deep vein thrombosis) ppx (prophylaxis) with sc heparin due to his immobilization in the ICU. This is to prevent the formation of blood clots, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.

4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD (coronary artery disease) and possible anterolateral WMA (wall motion abnormality) during catheterization. There is a risk of further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) treated 30 years ago. He presented with epigastric pain and had a ST-elevation on EKG but no significant coronary artery disease was found. He was brought to the cath lab and then transferred to the MICU for Gram-negative rod (GNR) sepsis.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Sepsis: Resolving white count and bandemia, on Levo and Zosyn for GNRs. He had a central venous line (CVL) placed for hypotension event yesterday, was briefly on dopamine (2 hours), and received 2 L NS.
- Follow blood cx sensitivities and speciation and urine cx
- Follow-up final read on CT torso for infectious processes
- Monitor BP, low threshold for fluid boluses

2. Hepatitis: Transaminases and Alk Phos are improving, but INR and bilirubin representatives of synthetic liver function are rising, which is worrisome. Hepatitis viral serologies are pending. Imaging has been unrevealing so far. Unclear whether the liver inflammation is cause, effect, or unrelated to the GNR bacteremia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB), which was treated 30 years ago. He presented with epigastric pain and had ST elevations on EKG, but no significant coronary artery disease was found during catheterization. He was transferred to the MICU for suspected gram-negative bacterial (GNR) sepsis. 

The patient's current condition includes resolving white count and bandemia, hypotension, and placement of a central venous line (CVL). He was briefly on dopamine and received 2 liters of normal saline. Blood cultures are being monitored for sensitivities and speciation, and urine cultures are also being monitored. The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored, with a low threshold for fluid boluses.

Additionally, the patient has hepatitis with improving transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels, but rising INR and bilirubin levels, indicating worsening synthetic liver function. Imaging has not revealed any specific cause for the liver inflammation. It is unclear whether the liver inflammation is a cause, effect, or unrelated to the GNR bacteremia. It is possible that the patient has developed ""shock liver,"" which is resolving after sepsis-driven hypotension.

The patient's ST elevation on EKG is likely due to a Brugada variant related to the stress of his sepsis events. An echocardiogram was reassuring,"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis treated 30 years ago. He presented with epigastric pain and STE on EKG, but no significant coronary artery disease was found during catheterization. He was transferred to the MICU for Gram-negative sepsis. The patient's initial white count and bandemia are resolving, and he is being treated with Levofloxacin and Zosyn for GNRs. The source of sepsis is unclear. He also has mild gallbladder edema on RUQ ultrasound.

The patient's liver function tests (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase) are improving, but his international normalized ratio (INR) and bilirubin levels are still elevated. Hepatitis viral serologies are pending. Imaging has been unrevealing so far. It is unclear whether the liver inflammation is the cause, effect, or unrelated to the GNR bacteremia. It may be a case of shock liver, resolving after sepsis-driven hypotension. An MRCP has been ordered today.

The patient has had ST elevation in V2 in recent EKGs, likely a Brugada variant related to the stress of his sepsis events. His echocardiogram was reassuring, and EKGs continue to improve. He will continue on baby aspirin, and may need outpatient follow-up with an electrophysiologist.

The patient also experiences orthopnea,"

The patient has a history of acute hepatitis with heterogeneous hepatic enhancement, wall thickening of the non-distended gallbladder, small right pleural effusion, small amount of ascites, and diverticulosis. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (Levofloxacin and Zosyn) for an unknown infection, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lactic acid levels. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range. Troponin-T levels are normal, indicating no cardiac injury. The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and magnesium (Mg++) are within"
