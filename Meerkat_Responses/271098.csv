   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a complicated medical history admitted to the ICU for presumed septic shock. He has been diagnosed with left obstructive nephropathy and found to be Clostridium difficile positive. The patient's conditions include UTI/urosepsis, C. diff infection, acute renal failure, abdominal distension, leg pain, stoma protrusion, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:
1. Worsening septic shock: The patient was initially admitted with presumed septic shock, and there is a possibility of it worsening if proper treatment and care are not provided.
2. Kidney damage or failure: The patient has left obstructive nephropathy and acute renal failure, which may lead to further kidney damage or failure if not managed appropriately.
3. C. difficile infection spread: As the patient is C. difficile positive, there is a risk of spreading the infection to other parts of the body or to other patients if strict infection control measures are not followed.
4. Abdominal distension complications: The patient's distended abdomen could potentially lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or increased risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Leg pain and immobility: The patient complains of bilateral leg pain, which may contribute to immobility. Prolonged immobility can increase the risk of blood clots"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 y/o M with PMH of prior CVA, indwelling catheter and multiple prior
   UTIs admitted with shock, likely septic and [**2-3**] urinary tract
   infection.
   #. Altered mental status: Appears similar to prior episode per review
   of discharge summary and patient is clinically infected. He is oriented
   and appropriate when answering questions and neurologic examination is
   not focal to point to an intracranial process (though somewhat limited
   by language barrier & patient's mental status). The patient also is on
   chronic narcotic pain medications at his NH and received morphine IV at
   the OSH, which could cause somnolence.
   - close monitoring of mental status
   - continue to treat infections
   - obtain non-contrast head CT this PM given h/o CVA and current
   somnolence
   - check ABG to ensure not retaining CO2
   - avoid sedating medications
   #. Hypotension, likely septic in etiology [**2-3**] UTI, improved: The
   patient is now hypertensive after IV fluids. Hypertension could be
   related to autonomic instability (given his neurologic diagnoses)
   though not documented in prior d/c summary.
   - Treat UTI with vancomycin, zosyn
   - repeat UA & urine culture here
   - if urine culture positive, will likely need suprapubic cath replaced
   by urology during admission
   - follow up on B&W culture results on [**9-7**]
   - Continue flagyl for potential C diff/abd process
   - Monitor BP closely & check BP in opposite arm
   - consider arterial line if BP labile or does not correlate
   - check CVP to assess volume status, though clinically currently
   euvolemic
   - if hypotension recurs, consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim given prior prednisone
   course
   #. Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 2.1 at OSH. Repeat here 2.
   Likely secondary to hypotension/hypovolemia from infectious process as
   above. He has fair urine output at present.
   - If not improved, consider renal ultrasound in AM
   - Obtain urine lytes if Cr not improved
   #. Respiratory distress: The patient was hypoxic prior to transfer to
   B&W earlier though no apparent distress currently and lung exam/CXR not
   indicative of pneumonia. Apparently finished course of vanc/cefepime on
   [**9-1**] for aspiration pneumonia.
   - continue supplemental oxygen to maintain sat > 92% and wean as
   tolerated
   - cycle cardiac enzymes given ? prior cardiac ischemia last admission
   - repeat EKG in AM
   #. Abdominal distension: The patient's abdomen is distended but no
   vomiting or abd pain by report. KUB and LFTs/lipase at [**Hospital1 5073**] unrevealing. Given recent abx, concern for C diff with elevated
   WBC count.
   - cover intra-abdominal source with zosyn & flagyl
   - monitor serial abd exams
   - send C diff if has stool output
   # Leg pain: Patient states pain is bilateral and longstanding. On
   gabapentin & oxycodone at nursing facility. Patient complains of pain
   upon waking but does not appear in distress.
   - avoid sedating meds
   - continue to monitor
   - tylenol when taking POs, may resume gabapentin at that time as well
   # Stoma protrusion: Likely benign given that stoma appears pink and is
   soft. No abd tenderness.
   - consider contact surgery in the AM for evaluation
   # DM: On lantus & humalog (with meals & sliding scale) at baseline.
   Will give sliding scale for now and resume prior regimen when taking
   POs.
   #. FEN - NPO for now given mental status. Lyte repletion prn.
   #. PPx - Hep SC TID. PPI (recent gastritis). Bowel meds when taking
   POs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), indwelling catheter, and multiple urinary tract infections. He was admitted with shock, likely septic, and 2-3 urinary tract infections. The patient appears to have altered mental status, which is similar to a previous episode, possibly due to chronic narcotic pain medications or morphine IV. There are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status needs close monitoring, and it is important to obtain a non-contrast head CT to rule out any intracranial process. Avoiding sedating medications is also crucial.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely septic in etiology due to the urinary tract infection. Treating the UTI with vancomycin and zosyn is essential. Repeating urine culture here and considering suprapubic catheter replacement by urology during admission are necessary. Monitoring blood pressure closely and checking it in the opposite arm are important.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased up to 2.1 at OSH and are currently at 2.0. This is likely secondary to hypotension/hypovolemia from the infectious process. Monitoring urine output and obtaining urine lytes if creatinine does not improve are necessary. Considering a renal ultrasound in the morning is also"

   61 y/o M with PMH of prior CVA, indwelling catheter and multiple prior
   UTIs admitted with shock, likely septic and [**2-3**] urinary tract
   infection.
   Note: No Citalopram while on Vanc
   Needs to change right IJ
   Call [**Hospital1 183**] to f/u sensitivities
   #. Altered mental status: Appears similar to prior episode per review
   of discharge summary and patient is clinically infected. He is oriented
   and appropriate when answering questions and neurologic examination is
   not focal to point to an intracranial process (though somewhat limited
   by language barrier & patient's mental status). The patient also is on
   chronic narcotic pain medications at his NH and received morphine IV at
   the OSH, which could cause somnolence.
   - close monitoring of mental status
   - continue to treat infections
   - obtain non-contrast head CT this PM given h/o CVA and current
   somnolence
   - check ABG to ensure not retaining CO2
   - avoid sedating medications
   #. Hypotension, likely septic in etiology [**2-3**] UTI, improved: The
   patient is now hypertensive after IV fluids. Hypertension could be
   related to autonomic instability (given his neurologic diagnoses)
   though not documented in prior d/c summary.
   - Treat UTI with vancomycin, zosyn
   - repeat UA & urine culture here
   - if urine culture positive, will likely need suprapubic cath replaced
   by urology during admission
   - follow up on B&W culture results on [**9-7**]
   - Continue flagyl for potential C diff/abd process
   - Monitor BP closely & check BP in opposite arm
   - consider arterial line if BP labile or does not correlate
   - check CVP to assess volume status, though clinically currently
   euvolemic
   - if hypotension recurs, consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim given prior prednisone
   course
   #. Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 2.1 at OSH. Repeat here 2.
   Likely secondary to hypotension/hypovolemia from infectious process as
   above. He has fair urine output at present.
   - If not improved, consider renal ultrasound in AM
   - Obtain urine lytes if Cr not improved
   #. Respiratory distress: The patient was hypoxic prior to transfer to
   B&W earlier though no apparent distress currently and lung exam/CXR not
   indicative of pneumonia. Apparently finished course of vanc/cefepime on
   [**9-1**] for aspiration pneumonia.
   - continue supplemental oxygen to maintain sat > 92% and wean as
   tolerated
   - cycle cardiac enzymes given ? prior cardiac ischemia last admission
   - repeat EKG in AM
   #. Abdominal distension: The patient's abdomen is distended but no
   vomiting or abd pain by report. KUB and LFTs/lipase at [**Hospital1 5073**] unrevealing. Given recent abx, concern for C diff with elevated
   WBC count.
   - cover intra-abdominal source with zosyn & flagyl
   - monitor serial abd exams
   - send C diff if has stool output
   # Leg pain: Patient states pain is bilateral and longstanding. On
   gabapentin & oxycodone at nursing facility. Patient complains of pain
   upon waking but does not appear in distress.
   - avoid sedating meds
   - continue to monitor
   - tylenol when taking POs, may resume gabapentin at that time as well
   # Stoma protrusion: Likely benign given that stoma appears pink and is
   soft. No abd tenderness.
   - consider contact surgery in the AM for evaluation
   # DM: On lantus & humalog (with meals & sliding scale) at baseline.
   Will give sliding scale for now and resume prior regimen when taking
   POs.
   #. FEN - NPO for now given mental status. Lyte repletion prn.
   #. PPx - Hep SC TID. PPI (recent gastritis). Bowel meds when taking
   POs.
   # Access: 2 PIVs, R IJ CVL (will need replacement within 24 hours if
   still necessary as placed at OSH)
   #. Code - Full, confirmed with patient's sister, HCP. [**Name2 (NI) 59**] [**Name2 (NI) **] products
   without speaking with sister as patient is [**Name (NI) 5074**] witness.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including a history of stroke, neurogenic bladder with chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter, recurrent urinary tract infections, lymphoma, and systemic lupus erythematosus. He presented to the ICU with sepsis secondary to impacted renal stones and now also has Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 157/85 mmHg, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His temperature is within normal range at 36.7°C (98.1°F). The patient is conscious and appropriate, with swelling of hands and feet. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, soft abdomen with bloody drainage from the percutaneous nephrostomy, dry and scaling skin, and no neurological deficits. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1.7 to 2.0 mg/dL, and slightly low potassium levels at 3.3 mEq/L. Blood cultures from [**Hospital1 183**] were positive for pseudomonas. 

The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including linezolid, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin. Clostr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including a prior stroke, neurogenic bladder with chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter, recurrent urinary tract infections, lymphoma, and systemic lupus erythematosus. He is currently in the ICU with sepsis due to impacted renal stones following an interventional radiology-guided percutaneous drain, compounded by Clostridium difficile infection. The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF) with acute tubular necrosis and post-obstructive diuresis, hyperglycemia, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and Flagyl for C. difficile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure, shock, and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has ARF with ATN and post-obstructive diuresis. If not treated promptly and effectively, this can progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which needs to be controlled to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has a C. difficile infection, which if left untreated, can lead to severe colitis, sepsis, and even death.
