   Disposition:To surgical service once extubated and stable
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent surgery to remove deep brain stimulator hardware placed during total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient had severe post-operative dyskinesia in the past, leading to shoulder dislocation. The current surgical procedure aimed to repair damage caused by the previous dyskinesia.

The patient is now immediately post-operative and is at risk of experiencing dyskinesia when coming out of surgical anesthesia. To prevent this, the patient is being sedated with propofol and receiving IV pain medications. The plan is to gradually wean the patient off sedation in the morning.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.9Â°F, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 94/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on invasive ventilation and has been since 05:16 PM. 

The patient's blood glucose level is low at 80 mg/dL, indicating the need for close monitoring and possible intervention. Other laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, and normal INR.

The patient's physical examination reveals little movement to voice, opening of eyes, and resistance when the examiner moves the eyelids. The patient's pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent surgery to remove hardware from her left glenoid component placed during total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient presented with severe post-operative dyskinesia in the past, resulting in a shoulder dislocation. She is currently in the ICU post-operation and experiencing spikes in temperature, with a highest recorded temperature of 100.9 degrees Celsius. Her vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. She is on invasive ventilation and receiving various medications, including propofol, dopamine, morphine sulfate, and fentanyl. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count. She is expected to be extubated soon and will be transferred to the surgical service once stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's invasive ventilation and recent surgery, there is a risk of respiratory infections or pneumonia due to prolonged intubation.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's low blood pressure and tachycardia may indicate potential cardiovascular issues, such as hypotension or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The elevated temperature and use of antibiotics suggest a possible infection, which could be related to the surgical site or another source.
4. Bleeding complications: The low platelet count could increase the risk of bleeding during the patient's recovery.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of Parkinson"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who presented to the unit immediately post-op from removal of deep brain stimulator hardware placed during a total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient had severe post-op dyskinesia in the past, resulting in shoulder dislocation. She is now immediately post-op from a left shoulder procedure aimed at repairing damage caused by her previous post-op dyskinesia. There is a fear that the patient will experience dyskinesia again when coming out of surgical anesthesia, so she is being sedated overnight and will have her sedation gradually weaned in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Postoperative dyskinesia: The patient's history of severe post-op dyskinesia and the fear of its recurrence when coming out of surgical anesthesia pose a potential complication. Sedation and gradual weaning may help manage this complication.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis, indicating a concern for potential infection post-surgery.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The use of TEDs (thromboembolic deterrent stockings) and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis suggests a concern for the development of DVT due to immobilization.
4. Respiratory complications: As the patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barot"

 PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND INTUBATION:
   Patient with severe post-op dyskinesia in past ([**2-/2147**]) resulting in
   shoulder dislocation. Patient is now post-op day 2 from left shoulder
   procedure that was an attempt to repair some damage done in [**2-/2147**]
   after her post-op dyskinesia. There is fear that patient will again
   have dyskinesia when coming out of surgical anesthesia.
   - Have restarted home Parkinson
s medications (continue
   Carbidopa-Levodopa 7 times daily and continue pramipexole TID)
   - Neurology following, has turned on DBS to full force
   - Sedating patient with propofol and bolus IV pain medications to keep
   her free of dyskinetic movements
   - Gradual liberation from sedation again today, although this may be
   difficult given dyskinesias yesterday
   - Appreciate input from patient's neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4387**]
   - Wean sedation so that may be extubated over 1-2 days after confirming
   with neurology and surgery
   - She would likely benefit from some increased pain medications 2-4 mg
   morphine peri-intubation
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Has significant fevers yesterday to 102.5 and throughout the day.  Felt
   to be more significant that standard post-op fevers.  CXR shows
   possible left-sided pneumonia although read as likely atelectasis.
   - Continue vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Cefepime started yesterday for
   HAP, possibly VAP
   - Send additional sputum cultures
   - Consider drug fever although this is less likely given time course,
   drugs administered
   - Send C Diff culture
   - No evidence of DVT at this time
   - Urinalysis negative yesterday morning
   - Unlikely to be just atelectasis given severity of fever
   - Ortho feels not related to wound, too early to be wound infection

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent a left shoulder surgery to repair damage caused by post-operative dyskinesia. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several complications.

1. Fever: The patient has had significant fevers, with a peak temperature of 102.5Â°F. The fever is not of unknown origin and there are concerns about possible pneumonia, especially given the presence of yellow sputum. The patient is being treated with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Cefepime) for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Respiratory Support: The patient is currently intubated and receiving respiratory support through CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 at 40%. Her SpO2 is 100%, and ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation.

3. Neurological Status: The patient has severe post-operative dyskinesia, which is a concern for both her comfort and the risk of dislocation of the surgical hardware. She has been sedated with propofol and given IV pain medications to manage the dyskinetic movements.

4. Immobilization: The patient's left arm is immobilized in a sling due to the shoulder surgery. She is non-weight bearing (NWB) on the left upper extremity and will continue to be kept in a sling.

5. Infection Control: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty on [**2147-3-20**]. She presented to the ICU post-op from the removal of hardware placed during the shoulder arthroplasty. The patient has a history of severe post-op dyskinesia resulting in shoulder dislocation. She is now post-op day 2 from a left shoulder procedure aimed at repairing damage caused by previous dyskinesia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever of 102.5 and shows signs of atelectasis on the left side. There is a possibility of left-sided pneumonia, which can be confirmed through further evaluation and imaging.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient is already on antibiotics, but additional sputum cultures are needed to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.
3. Drug fever: Although less likely, drug fever should be considered given the time course of drug administration. It is important to review the patient's medication history and potential allergic reactions.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, increasing the risk of CRBSI. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or chills, is crucial.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent deep brain stimulator removal and left glenoid component placement. She presented to the unit post-op from the removal of hardware and was experiencing severe post-op dyskinesia. The patient was intubated and received invasive ventilation, but was extubated in the afternoon with minimal dyskinesia. Neurological examination revealed the ability to use amantadine and carcopa if swallowing was problematic. Orthopedic evaluation showed no complications. The patient's oral flora on sputum culture was negative, and she did not leave the operating room. Blood and urine cultures were sent. Allergies include codeine, which causes a rash. The last doses of antibiotics were cefepime and vancomycin. Infusions included morphine sulfate and acetaminophen. The patient received 1000 mL NS 4 and 1000 mL NS 5. Other medications included carbidopa-levodopa (25-100) multiple times daily, fentanyl citrate, heparin flush, levofloxacin, magnesium sulfate, mirapex, morphine sulfate, ondansetron, oxycontin, potassium chloride (powder), sodium chloride 0.9% flush, vesicare, and vitamin D.

   placed during total shoulder arthroplasty in [**2147-3-20**].
 PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND INTUBATION:
   Patient with severe post-op dyskinesia in past ([**2-/2147**]) resulting in
   shoulder dislocation. Patient is now post-op day 2 from left shoulder
   procedure that was an attempt to repair some damage done in [**2-/2147**]
   after her post-op dyskinesia. There is fear that patient will again
   have dyskinesia when coming out of surgical anesthesia.  Now s/p
   extubation [**1-3**].
   - restarted home Parkinson
s medications (continue Carbidopa-Levodopa 7
   times daily and continue pramipexole TID)
   - Neurology following, has turned on DBS to full force
   - Appreciate input from patient's neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4387**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] touch

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent a total shoulder arthroplasty and removal of deep brain stimulator hardware. She is now in the ICU post-op from a left shoulder procedure. The patient has a history of severe post-op dyskinesia and is currently experiencing fever, pain, and respiratory failure. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure but was successfully extubated in the afternoon with minimal dyskinesia. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia, as well as for drug fever. She is also on pain management with morphine and fentanyl. Her blood cultures are pending, and she is being closely monitored for any complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and possible left-sided pneumonia seen on chest X-ray supports this concern.
2. Drug fever: Given the time course of the fever and the administration of various antibiotics, it is important to consider a drug fever as a potential cause.
3. Wound infection: Although the orthopedic team does not believe the fever is related to the surgical wound, it is still important to monitor for signs of infection.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization of the left arm in a sling"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who presented to the unit post-op from the removal of deep brain stimulator hardware. She had previously undergone total shoulder arthroplasty, but experienced severe post-op dyskinesia resulting in shoulder dislocation. The patient is now post-op day 2 from another left shoulder procedure aimed at repairing damage caused by the previous dyskinesia. She has a history of Parkinson's disease and was on Parkinson's medications, which were restarted after extubation. The neurology team is following up with the patient, and input from the patient's neurologist is appreciated.

The patient's Hct dropped and responded to 3U of blood transfusion. A gastric lavage was positive, suggesting a possible stress ulcer. The patient had significant fevers three days ago, reaching 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which were considered more significant than standard post-op fevers. A chest X-ray showed possible left-sided pneumonia but was read as likely atelectasis. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Cultures are pending, and a drug fever is less likely given the time course and medications administered.

The patient has a history of chronic pain and acute pain related to the shoulder surgery. She is immobilized in a sling and will be kept in a non-weight-bearing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU post-op from the removal of deep brain stimulator hardware. She had a total shoulder arthroplasty on [2147-3-20]. The patient is now post-op day 2 from a left shoulder procedure aimed at repairing damage caused by post-op dyskinesia in [2-/2147]. She experienced severe post-op dyskinesia in the past, resulting in shoulder dislocation. There is a concern that the patient may again have dyskinesia when coming out of surgical anesthesia.

The patient's current condition includes fever, decreased hematocrit (Hct), respiratory failure, pain control, Parkinson's disease, and anemia. She has been experiencing significant fevers for the past three days, reaching up to 102.5. A chest X-ray showed possible left-sided pneumonia, although it was read as likely atelectasis. The patient is receiving Levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and had a deep brain stimulator implanted. The stimulator hardware was recently removed, and the patient underwent a left shoulder procedure to repair damage from previous post-op dyskinesia. The patient's left arm has been immobilized in a sling, and pain management with morphine IV and bolus fentanyl is being provided.

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU post-operative from the removal of hardware placed during total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient had a history of severe post-operative dyskinesia in the past, resulting in shoulder dislocation. She underwent a left shoulder procedure to repair damage caused by previous dyskinesia. 

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. Firstly, she has a fever of 210.2Â°F, which was initially thought to be related to stress ulcers but could also be indicative of an infection. Imaging showed a possible left-sided pneumonia, although it was read as likely atelectasis. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Secondly, the patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 28.7%. She received 2 units of blood and is planned for 3 more units. The low hematocrit may be due to bleeding during surgery or stress ulcers.

Thirdly, the patient has respiratory failure and requires intubation. She experienced severe post-operative dyskinesia in the past, leading to dislocation of her shoulder. There is a fear that she may have dyskinesia again when coming out of surgical anesthesia. The neurology team is being consulted for input on managing acute dyskinesias.

Additionally, the patient has pain control issues, with acute and chronic pain requiring management. The patient is on"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent a total shoulder arthroplasty on [**2147-3-20**]. She presented to the ICU immediately post-op from the removal of her deep brain stimulator hardware. The patient tolerated extubation well and is currently awake, alert, and lying comfortably in bed. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she has a history of post-op dyskinesia. The patient has been advanced to a full liquid diet and has pulled out her own NG tube. There are no indications for a CT scan of the shoulder, EGD, or colonoscopy at this time. However, there is a recommendation for an outpatient screening colonoscopy and a retic CT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shoulder Surgery Complications: The patient underwent a total shoulder arthroplasty and subsequently had her left glenoid component removed. There is a possibility of infection or wound complications, although the ortho team does not believe it is related to the surgical wound.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient had a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, which initially raised concerns for a possible GI bleed. However, GI consult results were negative for any bleeding, and the patient's guaiac test was also negative. Therefore, the likelihood of a GI bleed is low.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FOUO): The patient had significant fevers three days ago reaching"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty and subsequent removal of hardware due to post-operative dyskinesia. The patient tolerated extubation well. 

The patient's vital signs show a stable blood pressure, but elevated heart rate and respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient has gained weight since admission. 

Laboratory results indicate a normal white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Creatinine level is within normal range, and glucose levels are mostly within normal limits. Other lab values such as electrolytes, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus are also within normal limits.

The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and is on deep brain stimulation (DBS). She had post-operative dyskinesia after her initial surgery and underwent another surgical procedure to repair any damage caused by the previous episode of dyskinesia.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, which were initially thought to be related to the surgery or atelectasis. However, the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is being considered. Levofloxacin has been started for HAP, possibly VAP. 

The patient's pain management involves the use of morphine IV and bolus fentanyl as needed. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) include"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. She was intubated and admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. The patient has shown some improvement since admission, including being advanced to full liquid diet and being considered for discharge to a rehabilitation facility. However, she still requires overnight observation due to concerns about potential complications.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 156/55 mmHg to 176/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight has increased from 94 kg at admission to 97.6 kg.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, platelet count of 363 K/uL, blood glucose level ranging from 80 to 136 mg/dL, serum creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including sodium (Na+) of 140 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 3.6 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 103 mEq/L, and calcium (Ca++) of"

 PARKINSON'S DISEASE
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   68 yo F with Parkinson's s/p deep brain stimulator. Is presenting to
   unit immediately post-op from removal of hardware (L glenoid component)
   placed during total shoulder arthroplasty in [**2147-3-20**].

 PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND INTUBATION: Patient with severe post-op
   dyskinesia in past ([**2-/2147**]) resulting in shoulder dislocation. Patient
   is now post-op from left shoulder procedure that was an attempt to
   repair some damage done in [**2-/2147**] after her post-op dyskinesia. There
   was fear that patient would again have dyskinesia when coming out of
   surgical anesthesia, but tolerated extubation well on [**1-3**].
   - continue home Parkinson
s medications (continue Carbidopa-Levodopa 7
   times daily and continue pramipexole TID)
   - Neurology following, has turned on DBS to full force
   - Appreciate input from patient's neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4387**]
   .
   # Hct drop: responded to 3U of blood, gastric lavage and guaiac neg
   yesterday per GI consult.
   - GI recs seen and appreciated; do not think this was GI bleed ->
   continue IV PPI and rec outpatient colonoscopy, will change to PO PPI
   today
   - ortho aware (thought late for post surgical bleed could be prompted
   by dyskinesia)
   - Hct stable currently, monitor daily
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN) : afebrile
   o/n, had significant fevers 3 days ago to 102.5 afterwards.  Felt to be
   more significant that standard post-op fevers.  CXR shows possible
   left-sided pneumonia although read as likely atelectasis.
   - Continue Levofloxacin started [**1-2**] for HAP, possibly VAP
 now day 6
   of 8
   - f/u cultures
   - Consider drug fever although this is less likely given time course,
   drugs administered
   - Ortho feels not related to wound, too early to be wound infection
   #. Shoulder surgery:  Left arm has been immobilized in sling
   - Appreciate ortho team guiding management from this aspect
   - Keep shoulder immobilized in sling, NWB status
   - Pain management with oxycodone as needed
   - TEDs and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, no heparin or enoxaparin at
   this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU post-operative from the removal of hardware placed during total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient had a previous history of severe post-operative dyskinesia leading to shoulder dislocation. The surgery was performed to repair the damage caused by the previous dyskinesia. The patient tolerated extubation well on day 1.

The patient's current medical issues include anemia, respiratory failure, pain control, Parkinson's disease, fever, and a history of shoulder surgery. The patient has been experiencing significant fevers, which were initially thought to be post-operative fever but are now considered more significant. A chest X-ray showed possible left-sided pneumonia or atelectasis. The patient has been started on Levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been dropping but have responded to 3 units of blood, gastric lavage, and negative guaiac test. The gastrointestinal (GI) consult did not believe it was a GI bleed and recommended outpatient colonoscopy, changing the patient's proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to oral form today.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3Â°C (97.3Â°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 137/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress note and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent surgery to remove hardware from her left glenoid component after a total shoulder arthroplasty.
- She is currently in the ICU post-op and has been experiencing severe post-op dyskinesia in the past, resulting in a shoulder dislocation.
- The patient tolerated extubation well on day 3 but continues to have dyskinesia.
- Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been fluctuating, requiring blood transfusion.
- She had significant fevers on day 3 but is currently afebrile.
- A chest X-ray showed possible left-sided pneumonia or atelectasis.
- She is on multiple medications including Carbidopa-Levodopa for Parkinson's disease and antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- She has been immobilized in a sling due to the shoulder surgery and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient's pain management requires attention, and she is currently on oxycodone as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization in a sling after shoulder surgery puts her at an increased risk for developing DVT."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU post-operatively from the removal of hardware placed during total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient has a history of severe post-operative dyskinesia and was previously intubated but tolerated extubation well on the third day. She is currently on multiple medications for Parkinson's disease and has had a recent drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) which responded to blood transfusion and gastric lavage. The patient also experienced significant fevers three days ago, reaching up to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and a chest X-ray showed possible left-sided pneumonia or atelectasis. The patient is being treated with Levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is immobilized in a sling due to shoulder surgery and is receiving pain management with oxycodone as needed. The patient is also on TEDs and pneumoboots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and has a PICC line inserted. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels have been fluctuating, indicating a potential anemia. This could be due to blood loss during surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other causes.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, with the presence of possible pneumonia or atelectasis seen on the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty and removal of hardware from her left glenoid component. She presented with severe post-operative dyskinesia in the past, resulting in shoulder dislocation. The patient tolerated extubation well after the surgical anesthesia and is currently on home Parkinson's medications (Carbidopa-Levodopa 7 times daily and pramipexole TID). Neurology is following up, and the patient has turned on her deep brain stimulator (DBS) to full force. 

Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped, and she received 3 units of blood, gastric lavage, and guaiac negative per GI consult. It was determined that this was not a GI bleed, so she will continue taking po PPI and have an outpatient colonoscopy. Her Hct is currently stable, and she will be monitored daily.
2. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient was previously febrile but is now afebrile. Past fevers were felt to be more significant than standard post-op fevers. A chest X-ray showed possible left-sided pneumonia, although it was read as likely atelectasis. She will continue taking Levofloxacin started on day 2 for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent total shoulder arthroplasty. She presented to the ICU immediately post-op from the removal of hardware. The patient had a previous episode of severe post-op dyskinesia that resulted in a shoulder dislocation. She is currently post-op from a left shoulder procedure aimed at repairing damage caused by the previous dyskinesia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C (98.9Â°F), blood pressure ranging from 131/78 to 165/117 mmHg, heart rate between 76 and 94 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. 

The patient's blood work shows anemia with a hematocrit drop, but it has responded to 3U of blood transfusion and gastric lavage. Her white blood cell count has been fluctuating within normal range. The platelet count is slightly low. Her creatinine level is within normal range, and her glucose levels have been stable. Other lab results including PT/PTT/INR, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Parkinson's Disease and Intubation: The patient tolerated extubation well on day 3. She will continue her home Parkinson's medications and undergo neurological follow-up. The neurologist recommends continuing Carbidopa-Le"

   68 yo F with Parkinson's s/p deep brain stimulator who presented to the
   unit immediately post-op from removal of hardware (L glenoid component)
   placed during total shoulder arthroplasty in [**2147-3-20**].

 PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND INTUBATION: Patient with severe post-op
   dyskinesia in past ([**2-/2147**]) resulting in shoulder dislocation. Patient
   is now post-op from left shoulder procedure that was an attempt to
   repair some damage done in [**2-/2147**] after her post-op dyskinesia. There
   was fear that patient would again have dyskinesia when coming out of
   surgical anesthesia, but tolerated extubation well on [**1-3**].
   - continue home Parkinson
s medications (continue Carbidopa-Levodopa 7
   times daily and continue pramipexole TID)
   - Neurology following, has turned on DBS to full force
   - Appreciate input from patient's neurologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4387**]
 ANEMIA: Hematocrit drop, responded to 3U of blood, gastric lavage and
   guaiac neg per GI consult. Hct stable x 3 days
   - GI recs seen and appreciated; do not think this was GI bleed ->
   continue po PPI and rec outpatient colonoscopy/EGD
   - ortho aware (thought late for post surgical bleed could be prompted
   by dyskinesia)
   - Hct stable currently, monitor daily
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN) : Now
   afebrile.  Past fevers felt to be more significant that standard
   post-op fevers.  CXR shows possible left-sided pneumonia although read
   as likely atelectasis.
   - Continue Levofloxacin started [**1-2**] for HAP, possibly VAP
 now day 8
   of 8
   - Consider drug fever although this is less likely given time course,
   drugs administered
   - Ortho feels not related to wound, too early to be wound infection
   #. Shoulder surgery:  Left arm has been immobilized in sling
   - Appreciate ortho team guiding management from this aspect
   - Keep shoulder immobilized in sling, NWB status
   - Pain management with oxycodone as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU post-op from removal of deep brain stimulator hardware placed during total shoulder arthroplasty. The patient had a history of severe post-op dyskinesia in the past, which resulted in shoulder dislocation. She underwent a left shoulder procedure to repair damage caused by the previous dyskinesia. The patient tolerated extubation well on day 3.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped, but it has stabilized after receiving 3 units of blood, gastric lavage, and a negative guaiac test per GI consult. The cause is not believed to be a GI bleed, so the patient will continue taking oral proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and have an outpatient colonoscopy/EGD.
2. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient is now afebrile. Past fevers were felt to be more significant than standard post-op fevers. A chest X-ray showed possible left-sided pneumonia, although it was read as likely atelectasis. The patient will continue taking Levofloxacin started on day 2 for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Shoulder surgery: The left arm has been immobilized in a sling. The ortho team is guiding management from this aspect. The patient will keep"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who underwent a left glenoid component removal after total shoulder arthroplasty. She presented with severe post-operative dyskinesia in the past, resulting in shoulder dislocation. The patient tolerated extubation well. She continues to take her Parkinson's medications and has turned on her deep brain stimulator to full force. 

The patient experienced a drop in hematocrit, which responded to 3 units of blood, gastric lavage, and a negative guaiac test per GI consult. Her hemoglobin levels have stabilized for three days. 

The patient had a fever that resolved, and a chest X-ray showed possible left-sided pneumonia or atelectasis. She was started on Levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) on day 8. 

The patient's left arm has been immobilized in a sling due to shoulder surgery, and she is non-weight bearing. Pain management with oxycodone as needed is being provided. TEDs and pneumoboots are used for DVT prophylaxis, and she is not receiving heparin or enoxaparin at this time. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 118/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU postoperative from the removal of deep brain stimulator hardware. She had previously undergone total shoulder arthroplasty and experienced severe postoperative dyskinesia resulting in shoulder dislocation. The patient tolerated extubation well and is currently showing signs of dyskinesia on the right side. Her vital signs are stable, and she is receiving appropriate care for her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient's recent surgery increases the risk of developing a wound infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or drainage from the surgical site, is important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization and recent surgery increase the risk of blood clots forming in the legs. Prophylactic measures like TEDs (thromboembolic deterrent stockings) and pneumoboots should be continued to reduce the risk.
3. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of Parkinson's disease and intubation may increase the risk of respiratory issues. Monitoring for symptoms of pneumonia, such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath, is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have dropped, indicating anemia. This could be due to blood loss during surgery or other factors. Close monitoring and further evaluation are needed.
5. Drug reactions or allergies: The patient reported a"
