","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of mental retardation, seizure disorder, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent meningitis. He presents with fever, rash, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient's condition suggests possible hypotension/sepsis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and meningitis. He has been on broad antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir, for empirical coverage of meningitis as well as UTI. Blood and urine cultures have been sent, but no growth has been observed to date. The patient's vital signs show intermittent fevers and normal oxygen saturation. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's medications include several for his chronic conditions, including gabapentin for seizure disorder, sertraline, buspirone, and risperidone for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), lorazepam for anxiety, phenytoin for seizure disorder, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, famotidine for GERD, and holding coumadin due to supratherapeutic INR. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving IV fluids for goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 and urine output (UOP) >30 cc/h. If not responsive to fluid boluses, levophed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of mental retardation, seizure disorder, DVT, and recent meningitis. He presents with fever, rash, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient has been on coumadin due to his DVT history and it is being held as LP (lumbar puncture) is being discussed. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric coverage of meningitis as well as UTI. His vital signs are stable post-resuscitation, and he has intermittent fevers throughout the day. He has a macular rash over his arms that is of unclear etiology. His renal function has improved after IVF (intravenous fluids). He has a history of DVT, and his INR (International Normalized Ratio) is supratherapeutic on presentation. He is also on medications for OCD, seizure disorder, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest a possible ongoing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary.

2. Meningitis: Given the patient's recent history of meningitis, it is important to continue empirical antibiotic coverage and consider repeating lumbar puncture if the patient's condition worsens.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's dirty urinalysis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with fever, requiring levophed support and weaning off, droplet precautions discontinued due to low suspicion of bacterial meningitis. Neurology consulted and agreed to defer lumbar puncture for now. Blood cultures were sent from Hospital3 611, with no growth to date. The patient continues on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin. Despite negative cultures, the patient continues to spike fevers. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to Bactrim and received the last doses of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin on 2193-6-8, 2193-6-9, respectively.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently below normal limits, indicating hypotension. This could be due to septic shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Meningitis, other: Although the initial suspicion of bacterial meningitis seems low, the persistence of fever spikes despite broad-spectrum antibiotics raises concern for another type of meningitis or ongoing infection.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of fever and recent urinary catheterization increases the risk of UTI. However, no specific urinary symptoms or laboratory findings are mentioned in the note to confirm this diagnosis.
4. Respiratory support: The patient's respiratory status is stable at present, but there is no mention"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   48 yo man with h/o mental retardation, seizure disorder, DVT on
   coumadin, and recent meningitis who presents with fever, rash, relative
   leukocytosis, and hypotension.
   .
   Hypotension/Sepsis: Presents with fever, rash, and relative
   leukocytosis (baseline WBC [**1-31**]) with subsequent hypotension requiring
   pressors. Urosepsis higher on differential given dirty U/A. Meningitis
   possible given recent history of this and uncertain baseline mental
   status. Pulmonary source less likely given absence of respiratory
   symptoms and unremarkable CXR; influenza negative at OSH. At last
   hospitalization, anaphylactic shock was a concern; med list does not
   suggest there were any recent medication changes, and eos not elevated
   on diff. No findings to suggest cardiogenic shock.
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Cont broad antibiotics (vanc, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir) for empiric
   coverage of meningitis as well as UTI
   - Recheck coags s/p 1 dose of vitamin K and 1 unit FFP and consider LP
   once INR reversed. Of note, required IR-guided LP during last admission
   - Send urine culture; f/u blood cultures
   - F/u OSH blood and urine cultures
   - Wean off dopamine gtt as tolerated with fluid boluses as needed to
   maintain goal MAP >60 and UOP >30 cc/h. If not responsive to fluid
   boluses, would transition pressors to levophed.
   .
   Rash: Fine macular rash over arms b/l of unclear etiology. Eos not
   elevated to suggest allergy. No known new medications. Concern for rash
   in setting of meningitis but not classic appearance. Viral exanthem
   also possible; influenza negative.
   - Monitor for now
   .
   Acute renal failure: Cr 1.9 on presentation to OSH and 1.5 here. FENa
   1.2% nonspecific. [**Month (only) 51**] be prerenal given improvement after OSH fluids
   although ATN in setting of hypotension possible. No new meds to suggest
   AIN. Postrenal less likely. Did receive 5L IV fluids in ED.
   - Trend Cr
   - Hold gabapentin pending AM Cr
   - Consider further work-up if not improved
   .
   Abnormal electrolytes: Labs on arrival with Na 130, bicarb 14 c/w
   nonanion gap metabolic acidosis. Of note, Na 140 and bicarb 22 at OSH.
   [**Month (only) 51**] : Was 140 when checked at OSH. [**Month (only) 51**] be spurious versus hyponatremia
   in setting of hypovolemia. Now s/p 5L IV fluids in ED.
   - Recheck lytes
   .
   Hyperglycemia: On admission labs, gluc 400s. Was 112 at OSH. [**Month (only) 51**] be
   spurious value as no h/o diabetes. Glucose possibly elevated in setting
   of infection.
   - Recheck lytes as above
   .
   H/o DVT x 2: INR supratherapeutic on presentation
   - Hold coumadin given plan to reverse INR for LP
   - Pneumoboots for ppx
   .
   Hypertension: Currently hypotensive
   - Hold home atenolol 25mg and clonidine 0.1mg [**Hospital1 **] for now
   .
   OCD:
   - Cont home sertraline 250mg, buspirone 30mg [**Hospital1 **], and risperidone 0.5mg
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - Cont lorazepam 0.5-1mg po q4h prn anxiety
   - Holding clonidine for now given hypotension
   .
   Seizure disorder
   - Cont home phenytoin
   - Hold Neurontin 600 mg po tid for now pending repeat Cr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of mental retardation, seizure disorder, deep vein thrombosis on Coumadin, and recent meningitis. He presents with fever, rash, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient's medical history includes anaphylactic shock during a previous hospitalization, but no recent medication changes and no elevated eosinophils on differential. There are no findings to suggest cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient is being treated for possible urosepsis and meningitis. The sepsis is likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) given the dirty urinalysis. Meningitis is also a concern due to the recent history of this condition and the uncertain baseline mental status. A pulmonary source is less likely due to the absence of respiratory symptoms and unremarkable chest X-ray. Influenza has been ruled out at the outside hospital.

2. Rash: The patient has a fine macular rash over his arms, which is of unclear etiology. Eosinophils are not elevated to suggest an allergic reaction. No known new medications have been introduced. There is concern for a rash in the setting of meningitis, but it does not have a classic appearance. Viral exanthem is also possible, but influenza has been negative.

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   48 yo man with h/o mental retardation, seizure disorder, DVT on
   coumadin, and recent meningitis who presents with fever, rash, relative
   leukocytosis, and hypotension.
   Hypotension/Sepsis: Presents with fever, rash, and relative
   leukocytosis (baseline WBC [**1-31**]) with subsequent hypotension requiring
   pressors. Urosepsis higher on differential given dirty U/A but no
   culture sent from outside hospital. Meningitis possible given recent
   history of this and uncertain baseline mental status although per
   family he is currently at his baseline and has not had any evidence of
   seizure activity. Pulmonary source less likely given absence of
   respiratory symptoms and unremarkable CXR; influenza negative at OSH.
   At last hospitalization, anaphylactic shock was a concern; med list
   does not suggest there were any recent medication changes, and eos not
   elevated on diff. No findings to suggest cardiogenic shock.  Now off
   pressors but with intermittent fevers throughout the day.
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Cont broad antibiotics (vanc, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin) for
   empiric coverage of meningitis as well as UTI
   - f/u urine culture; f/u blood cultures
   - F/u OSH blood and urine cultures
   - IVF for goal MAP >60 and UOP >30 cc/h. If not responsive to fluid
   boluses, will restart levophed.
   - defer LP for now
   Rash: Fine macular rash over arms b/l of unclear etiology. Eos not
   elevated to suggest allergy. No known new medications.  Not classic
   appearance for meningitis. Viral exanthem also possible; influenza
   negative.
   - Monitor for now
   Acute renal failure: Cr 1.9 on presentation to OSH and 1.5 here. FENa
   1.2% nonspecific. [**Month (only) 51**] be prerenal given improvement after IVF.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have a component of ATN from hypotension.  Trace positive eos but
   no new meds to suggest AIN.

   Hyperglycemia: On [**Month (only) 1758**] labs, gluc 400s.  Likely spurious.  No
   history of diabetes.  All subsequent checks within normal limits.
   - no further workup
   H/o DVT x 2: INR supratherapeutic on presentation.  Currently coumadin
   being held as LP is being discussed.
   - Hold coumadin given plan to reverse INR for LP
   - Find out when DVT was and either start 1x per day lovenox or hold off

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of mental retardation, seizure disorder, DVT, and recent meningitis. He presents with fever, rash, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically for meningitis and UTI. His blood and urine cultures are negative to date. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he has been weaned off pressors. However, he continues to spike fevers. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension/sepsis: The patient initially required pressors for hypotension, indicating a possible septic state. Even though he is now off pressors, there is a risk of recurrent hypotension if his infection does not improve.
2. Meningitis: The patient has a history of meningitis, and his current symptoms, such as fever and relative leukocytosis, raise concerns for this diagnosis. If meningitis is confirmed, it may require further interventions like lumbar puncture (LP) and specific antibiotics.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's dirty urinalysis suggests a possible UTI. If confirmed, it could contribute to his fever and overall sepsis state.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Hyperglycemia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with mental retardation, seizure disorder, a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent meningitis. He was admitted with presumed septic shock, which has since resolved. The patient is suspected to have urosepsis, possibly due to a urinary tract infection or central nervous system infection. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics until culture data is available. The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly caused by acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis. Fluids are being given, renal dosing of medications is being done, and nephrotoxins are being minimized. The patient's history of DVT needs clarification, and his need for continued anticoagulation should be considered. The patient has a neuropsychiatric disorder and is being managed with various medications. The rest of the plan is as per the housestaff note. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient may develop further complications related to a urinary tract infection, such as worsening sepsis or the spread of infection to other organs.
2. Central Nervous System Infection: Given the patient's recent meningitis, there is a risk of developing another CNS infection, which can lead to severe complications like brain abscess or meningitis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires careful management to prevent further kidney damage and potential complications associated with renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with mental retardation, seizure disorder, a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent meningitis. He was admitted with presumed septic shock, which has since resolved. The patient is suspected to have an infection, possibly in the urine and/or central nervous system (CNS). The urine culture is pending, and there is a need to consider a lumbar puncture (LP) if he continues to have a fever. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone) are being administered until culture data is available.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), with a possible diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Renal dosing of medications and minimizing nephrotoxins are being continued. The history of DVT needs clarification, and the need for continued anticoagulation should be considered. The patient's neuropsychiatric disorder is being managed with sertraline, buspirone, risperidone, and lorazepam as needed. Phenytoin is being continued, and Neurontin is being held pending repeat creatinine levels.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition via a po diet, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and elevation of head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he is scheduled for transfer to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension, meningitis, and urinary tract infection. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 139/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is alert and oriented, with clear lungs and regular heart rhythm. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Renal function is within normal limits, while liver enzymes and electrolytes are also within normal range. The patient has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) - The patient has a history of DVT, and although they are on systemic anticoagulation, there is still a risk for clot formation in the lower extremities due to chronic venous changes and pitting pedal edema.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - If the patient develops a new clot that dislodges and travels to the lungs, it can lead to a potentially life-threatening condition known as"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo man with h/o mental retardation, seizure disorder, DVT on
   coumadin, and recent meningitis who presents with fever, rash, relative
   leukocytosis, and hypotension.
   Hypotension/Sepsis: Presents with fever, rash, and relative
   leukocytosis (baseline WBC [**1-31**]) with subsequent hypotension requiring
   pressors. Urosepsis higher on differential given dirty U/A but no
   culture sent from outside hospital. Meningitis possible given recent
   history of this and uncertain baseline mental status although per
   family he is currently at his baseline and has not had any evidence of
   seizure activity. Pulmonary source less likely given absence of
   respiratory symptoms and unremarkable CXR; influenza negative at OSH.
   At last hospitalization, anaphylactic shock was a concern; med list
   does not suggest there were any recent medication changes, and eos not
   elevated on diff. No findings to suggest cardiogenic shock.  Now off
   pressors but with intermittent fevers throughout the day.
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Cont broad antibiotics (vanc, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin) for
   empiric coverage of meningitis as well as UTI
   - f/u urine culture; f/u blood cultures
   - F/u OSH blood and urine cultures
   - IVF for goal MAP >60 and UOP >30 cc/h. If not responsive to fluid
   boluses, will restart levophed.
   - defer LP for now

","The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of mental retardation, seizure disorder, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent meningitis. He presents with fever, rash, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing fever, rash, and relative leukocytosis, which indicates a possible infection. He also had hypotension requiring pressors. Urosepsis is a possibility given the dirty urinalysis, although no culture was sent from the outside hospital. Meningitis is also a concern due to his recent history of this condition and uncertain baseline mental status. However, the patient's family reports that he is currently at his baseline and has not had any evidence of seizure activity. A pulmonary source is less likely because there are no respiratory symptoms, and the chest X-ray is unremarkable. Influenza was negative at the outside hospital.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level was 1.9 on presentation to the outside hospital and 1.5 at admission here. FENa is 1.2%, which is nonspecific. It is likely pre-renal given the improvement after intravenous fluids. However, there may also be a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension. There are trace positive eosinophils but no"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension, meningitis, and urinary tract infection. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The patient has been experiencing agitation about needles and procedures, so sedation may be required for an IR guided PICC insertion. No new neurological recommendations have been made.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently below the normal range, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis secondary to meningitis or urinary tract infection.
2. Meningitis: The patient's presentation of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status suggests meningitis. The exact causative organism is not mentioned in the note. Prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial to prevent further complications and reduce mortality.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's symptoms of fever and increased urinary output may indicate a UTI. Urinalysis and culture should be performed to identify the causative bacteria and determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events. Systemic anticoagulation with LMWH is being administered to prevent further clot formation.
5. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of mental retardation, seizure disorder, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent meningitis. He presented with fever, rash, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient's condition required the use of pressors to maintain blood pressure. All microbiology data is negative, making the etiology of the patient's symptoms unclear. Possible causes include urosepsis, meningitis, or an unknown pulmonary source. The patient is currently afebrile and off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever, rash, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension suggests the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued assessment of microbiology results are necessary to identify the source of infection and guide appropriate treatment.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level (1.9 on presentation to OSH, now improving to 1 with baseline 0.5) indicating acute renal failure. Continued monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly are required.
3. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on lovenox for anticoagulation. It is essential to continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thrombotic events.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures were previously unstable but are now stable post"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of mental retardation, seizure disorder, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent meningitis. He presented with fever, rash, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension. The etiology of his symptoms is unclear as all microbiology data are negative. Urosepsis is higher on the differential given a dirty urinalysis. Meningitis is also possible due to his recent history of this condition, although the patient's current mental status is reported to be at baseline with no evidence of seizure activity.

The patient has been treated for various conditions including hypotension/sepsis, rash, acute renal failure, history of DVT, hypertension, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anemia. He has been started on enoxaparin (lovenox) for anticoagulation, which is necessary due to his multiple DVTs. His INR was initially supratherapeutic but has normalized now that he is on lovenox and off coumadin.

The patient's blood pressure is currently stable post-resuscitation, so his home medications for hypertension will be held for now. His other home medications for OCD, seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, and GERD will be continued. He will also continue taking lorazepam for anxiety.

The patient's renal function has improved, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with mental retardation, seizure disorder, a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent meningitis. He was admitted with presumed septic shock, which has since resolved. The patient's current conditions include a possible urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure (ARF) possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), and a history of DVT. He also has a neuropsychiatric disorder including mental retardation, seizure disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Additionally, the patient has hypertension (HTN) and is on multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Urosepsis: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, rash, and relative leukocytosis, suggest the possibility of urosepsis. This condition can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Thromboembolic Events: Given the patient's history of DVT and potential hypercoagulable state, there is a risk of further thromboembolic events. Monitoring and continuation of anticoagulation therapy are essential.
4. Medication Side Effects: With"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with mental retardation, seizure disorder, a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on coumadin, and recent meningitis. He was admitted with presumed septic shock, which has since resolved. The patient is suspected to have urosepsis as the most likely etiology. He has difficulty obtaining alternate access due to a right femoral line. The patient's allergies include Bactrim (oral) and anaphylaxis to antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/84 mmHg to 157/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the sepsis.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,608 mL with outputs totaling 4,720 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving multiple medications including enoxaparin (lovenox), famotidine (pepcid), vancomycin, colace, Zoloft, buspirone, synthroid, risperidone, ampicillin, CTX, and lovenox.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6."
