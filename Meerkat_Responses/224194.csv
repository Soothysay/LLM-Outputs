- The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hip fracture, post-operative atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.
- She has a small left ventricular size and a small pericardial effusion.
- The patient experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation but has since returned to sinus rhythm.
- Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/35 mmHg to 111/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.
- The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and glucose levels, as well as decreased potassium and phosphate levels.
- She has been started on maintenance fluids and received two boluses of normal saline for low blood pressures and urine output.
- The patient is scheduled for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) tomorrow.
- She has not been anticoagulated due to brief occurrences of atrial fibrillation, but there is a need to decide on anticoagulation as an outpatient considering her risk of fall versus the risk of stroke.

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hip fracture, post-operative atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with small left ventricle (LV), small pericardial effusion, and troponin leak. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions.

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation while on the floor, but has returned to sinus rhythm. The etiology of the atrial fibrillation is uncertain, possibly due to pain or pulmonary embolism (PE). She was given amiodarone IV and will continue on beta blockers until oral access is established.

2. Hip Fracture: The patient had a hip fracture that underwent surgical repair (KROD). Ortho follow-up is planned, and she is on Lovenox for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

3. History of Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke and is on Clopidogrel and ASA for prophylaxis.

4. CHF: The patient has preserved ejection fraction (EF) with hyperdynamic function, indicating volume sensitivity. Lasix has been withheld due to the presence of atrial fibrillation. The patient appears dry on examination.

5. Anemia (Blood Loss): The patient has stable hematocrit (Hct) levels at 24.2% and may benefit from packed red blood"

- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 96/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted below.
- The patient's flow sheet data includes hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and other relevant information.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The creatinine levels are within normal range, while the troponin-T level is low. Other lab values are provided.
- The patient's physical examination findings are incomplete due to non-assessment of certain parameters.
- The patient has been diagnosed with dysphagia, atrial fibrillation, and acute/chronic pain.
- The patient's code status and disposition are noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias due to underlying atrial fibrillation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia due to dysphagia and use of nasogastric tube.
3. Infection related to the J-tube placement.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
5. Stress ulcer bleeding due to chronic pain and use of corticosteroids for pain control.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
7. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin or dextrose infusions for glycemic control.
8. Renal insufficiency or acute kidney injury due to inadequate fluid balance or nephrotoxic medications.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the given progress note, and additional information may be required for a more accurate assessment."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hip fracture, post-operative atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with small left ventricle (LV), small pericardial effusion, and troponin leak. She was initially on IV Lopressor for atrial fibrillation but did not respond and was switched to Amiodarone. The patient also has a history of stroke and is on Clopidogrel and ASA. She is planned for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement due to her inability to take oral medications. The patient has anemia likely due to blood loss, and her hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable at 26. She has Parkinson's disease and is currently receiving outpatient medications for it. The patient's code status is DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and DNI (Do Not Intubate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced a return to atrial fibrillation during the PEG placement procedure. This can lead to irregular heart rhythm, increased risk of clot formation, and potential complications such as stroke.
2. Hip Fracture: The patient had a hip fracture and underwent operative repair. There is a risk of complications such as non-union, malunion, infection, or prosthetic joint infection.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hip fracture, post-operative atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with small left ventricle, small pericardial effusion, and troponin leak. She was initially on ciprofloxacin but has been switched to metoprolol IV for rate control. She underwent unsuccessful attempts at placing a feeding tube (J-tube) due to the colon blocking the entry site. As a result, a nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed for tube feeds and oral medications while waiting for the surgery to place the J-tube. The patient's critical status has fluctuated between 24 and 26. Her serum glucoses are elevated, but the reliability of these results is unclear. She has received repletion for magnesium and potassium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient returned to AF while getting PEG placement and required an abort procedure after a trial of lopressor. She was given an amiodarone re-load followed by gtt.

2. Hip Fracture: The patient underwent operative repair for her hip fracture. She is on weight-bearing restrictions and receiving Lovenox for prophylaxis.

3. History of Stroke: The patient is on clopidogrel and ASA for her history of stroke. She has been planned for J-tube placement with surgery due to her inability"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/oF with hip fracture and post-op atrial fibrillation, history of
   CHF with small LV, small pericardial effusion, troponin leak.
   .
   #) Atrial Fibrillation: Returned to AF while getting PEG placement.
   Aborted procedure after trial of lopressor.  Patient was then given
   Amiodarone 150mg x1 then uptitrated beta blocker. Converted to sinus
   rhythm yesterday.  Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - Titrate beta blocker as tolerated.
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   - Lovenox today.  Will hold lovenox prior to OR.  Decision previously
   was to hold coumadin given presentation with fall.
   .
   #) Hip Fx
    - S/p operative repair (KROD)
    - Ortho to follow
   -  WBAT
    - On Lovenox
   .
   #) h/o Stroke
   - on ASA.  Hold Plavix pending surgery
 will d/w surgery.
   - Plan for J-tube placement with surgery given inability to take POs
   (confirmed by speech/swallow).  Surgery is requesting CT scan to
   evaluate anatomy prior to placement.
   - NG tube in place.  Continue TF.  Will need to hold prior to PEJ
   placement once given date by surgery.  Likely OR tomorrow.
   .
   #) CHF
   - Preserved EF, hyperdynamic with small LV suggesting volume
   sensitivity
   - Will stop/hold lasix for now given AF
   - Seems dry on exam.
   .
   #) Anemia (Blood Loss)
   - Hct stable now at 26, transfuse for active bleeding.
   .
   #) Parkinson's : Continue outpatient meds
   .#) FEN:
   - NGT in place.  Begin TF.  Will need to hold at MN if OR tomorrow.
    - strict NPO per S&S eval. Pending PEG/PEJ today will return to lab
   - K, Phos, Mg repletion prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hip fracture, post-operative atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF) with small left ventricle (LV), small pericardial effusion, and troponin leak. The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, which was initially managed with Lopressor but later converted to sinus rhythm after administration of Amiodarone. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83-114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events mentioned below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent conversion to sinus rhythm indicate a potential risk for recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as heart rhythm abnormalities, stroke, or clot formation.
2. Hip Fracture: The patient's history of hip fracture and subsequent surgical repair (KROD) suggest a risk of complications related to the surgical procedure, including infection, bleeding, or impaired mobility.
3. CHF: The patient's preserved ejection fraction with small LV suggests volume sensitivity, indicating a risk of fluid overload or exacerbation of CHF symptoms, such"
