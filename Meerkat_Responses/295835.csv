","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, depression, chronic kidney disease, and gastroparesis. He presented to the ICU with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Initial assessment revealed worsened renal failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and concern for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient received intravenous fluids, bicarbonate, and an insulin drip, resulting in improvement of the anion gap. His insulin gtt was discontinued, and he will be started on long-acting insulin and sliding scale. Serum electrolytes and anion gap will be rechecked this evening.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient initially presented with an elevated blood sugar and concern for DKA. However, his anion gap has improved after receiving IVF, bicarbonate, and insulin therapy. Close monitoring of serum electrolytes and anion gap is essential to prevent further development of DKA.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease and acute-on-chronic renal failure. His renal function needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent further deterioration. Hemodialysis has been initiated to manage his renal failure.
3. Hypertension: The patient has poorly controlled hypertension, which needs to be managed appropriately. His current blood pressure is elevated, and additional antihypertensive medications may be required"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of type I diabetes mellitus, depression, chronic renal failure, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU due to an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient received treatment for DKA, including insulin infusions, fluids, and bicarbonate. He also received packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for anemia with a hemoglobin level of 20%.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient's condition improved, and he expressed a desire to transition from intravenous (IV) to oral medications. He requested to discontinue the insulin infusion and start taking Lantus, a long-acting insulin.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, watermelon, almonds, and a history of anaphylaxis. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 143/72 mmHg to 235/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89% on nasal cannula.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,816 mL, with 1,079 mL being IV fluids. His urine output is 650 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of potassium"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1811**] is a 32 yo man with HTN, DM 1 c/b gastroparesis, and CKD in
   work-up for HD, who p/w abdominal pain and N/V/D x 2 days, found to
   have worsened renal failure and AG metabolic acidosis with concern for
   DKA.
   # N/V/D, abdominal pain: Given low grade fever and acute onset, most
   c/w viral gastroenteritis although possible that this is exacerbated by
   uremia. Also pt has a hx of gastroparesis. Abd exam nonfocal but with
   tenderness. Lipase is normal. Mild elevation of LFTs. Pt does not
   appear fluid overloaded on exam. Not currently havind diarrhea
   - IVF as long at pt does not become tachypnic
 may be able to
   discontinue today and encourage PO fluids
   - NPO except meds overnight but likely transition to PO meds and diet
   today
   - Zofran prn
   - Morphine prn for pain control
   - will send c.diff and stool studies if diarrhea returns
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Increase above baseline on presentation
   probably due to uremia in setting of dehydration. It slightly improved
   s/p 2L IVF near baseline gap of 19. But now BS is elevated and there is
   concern for DKA inaddition to uremia. Lactate is normal.
   - Trend anion gap
   - IVF as above
   - insulin gtt to tx DKA
 likely will discontinue this morning
   - recheck serum and urine for ketones
   # DM:  BS currently elevated with AG, concern for DKA.
   - Will place pt on insulin gtt and hold glargine for now
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] is aware
   - will monitor lytes Q4H
   - checking for ketones
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt already ESRD and likely is
   prerenal in setting of profuse N/V/D. However this may be presentation
   of uremia. Received 2L IVF in ED and getting more IVF currently to
   replace PO output, but need to be careful due to renal function.
   - Monitor Cr
   - Cont calcitriol and calcium acetate
   - Renally dose all meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal aware and would like pt to start HD later [**Last Name (LF) 1330**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] renal AVF
   is ready to use
   - transplant surgery aware
   - consider more lasix if pt becomes SOB
   # Anemia: Hct 20, mildly below baseline of 25. Thought to be
   combination of iron deficiency and CKD. Pt denies any blood in emesis
   or stools.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct with PM hct
   - Hold specimen ordered; transfuse for Hct <21
   - two units crossmatched
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely combination of discomfort and dehydration.
   No concerning findings on EKG.  Also could not tolerate his PO BB.
   - Supportive care as above
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. [**Month (only) 60**] be in setting of acute discomfort; also
   unable to tolerate home meds this AM.
   - Metoprolol 10mg IV q6h over night
   - Resume home BP meds of metoprolol and amlodipine if able (metop
   succinate changed to tartrate in case uptitration needed)

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 32-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 1, and chronic kidney disease.
- He presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for 2 days.
- The patient has worsened renal failure and an anion gap metabolic acidosis, with concerns for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
- He received 2 liters of intravenous fluids in the emergency department and is currently getting more IVF to replace oral output.
- The patient's blood sugar is currently elevated with an anion gap, causing concern for DKA.
- Insulin gtt has been initiated to treat DKA, and glargine has been held for now.
- The patient's Hct level is 20, mildly below baseline, due to a combination of iron deficiency and CKD.
- He has been prescribed iron supplements, and his Hct will be trended with PM hct.
- Two units of crossmatched blood have been ordered, and transfusion will be given for Hct <21.
- The patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled, and metoprolol 10mg IV q6h has been started.
- The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and metoprolol.
- The patient's allergies include penicillins, watermelon, almonds, and anaphylaxis.
- The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on [**2145-2-19**].
- He has been placed on insulin gtt and hold glargine for now.
- His serum and urine will be rechecked for ketones.
- The patient's electrolytes will be monitored every 4 hours.
- He will be transitioned to PO fluids and diet today.
- The patient's renal function will be closely monitored, and he will start hemodialysis later today.
- Transplant surgery has been informed.
- The patient's family has been aware of the changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient's elevated blood sugar and anion gap metabolic acidosis indicate a potential DKA episode. Insulin gtt has been initiated to treat DKA, and his serum and urine will be rechecked for ketones.
2. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) - The patient has worsening renal failure, and his renal function needs to be closely monitored. He will start hemodialysis later today.
3. Hypertension - The patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled, and metoprolol has been started to manage his hypertension.
4. Anemia - The patient's Hct level is mildly below baseline, indicating a need for further investigation and treatment.
5. Gastroenteritis - The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be due to viral gastroenteritis, exacerbated by uremia."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus type 1 complicated by gastroparesis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He presented to the hospital for hemodialysis (HD) evaluation and work-up. The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has refused to take calcium supplements due to their size, and his blood sugar levels have been fluctuating. The patient's blood pressure remains poorly controlled despite multiple antihypertensive medications. His hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, likely secondary to CKD. The patient's current medications include insulin, metoprolol, hydralazine, amlodipine, and proton pump inhibitors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and high blood sugar levels indicate a possible DKA episode. It is crucial to closely monitor his blood sugar levels and provide appropriate treatment with insulin therapy.

2. Uncontrolled hypertension: Despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. This increases the risk of cardiovascular complications. Adjustments to his antihypertensive regimen may be necessary.

3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest anemia, which could be related to his CKD. Monitoring his"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1811**] is a 32 yo man with HTN, DM 1 c/b gastroparesis, and CKD in
   work-up for HD, who p/w abdominal pain and N/V/D x 2 days, found to
   have worsened renal failure and AG metabolic acidosis with concern for
   DKA.
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis
 DKA: Increase above baseline on
   presentation probably due to uremia in setting of dehydration. It
   slightly improved s/p 2L IVF near baseline gap of 19. On admission to
   MICU, BS is elevated and there was concern for DKA in addition to
   uremia. Lactate is normal.
   - Patient received IVF, bicarb, insulin drip and ultimately closed his
   Anion Gap (as much as could be expected in patient with CKD) by 7am
   today
   - Discontinue insulin gtt
 long acting insulin + sliding scale, will
   discuss this with [**Last Name (un) 276**]
   - Will recheck serum electrolytes and anion gap this evening
   # N/V/D, abdominal pain: Given low grade fever and acute onset, most
   c/w viral gastroenteritis although possible that this is exacerbated by
   uremia. Also pt has a hx of gastroparesis. Abd exam nonfocal but with
   tenderness. Lipase is normal. Mild elevation of LFTs. Patient no
   currently having diarrhea
   - IVF as long at pt does not become tachypnic
 may be able to
   discontinue today and encourage PO fluids
   - Advance patient
s diet as tolerated and encourage PO fluids
   - Zofran prn
   - Morphine prn for pain control
   - Follow-up on Cdiff studies
   # DM:  BS elevated with AG, concern initially  for DKA.
   - Will resume glargine and insulin sliding scale, discontinue insulin
   gtt per above
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] following
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt already ESRD and likely is
   prerenal in setting of profuse N/V/D. However this may be presentation
   of uremia. Received 2L IVF in ED and 5 liters in the MICU, but need to
   be careful due to renal function.
   - Social Work consult for coping with initiation of dialysis and
   chronic disease (DM1)
   - Monitor Cr
   - Cont calcitriol and calcium acetate
   - Renally dose all meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Renal aware and will start hemodialysis for patient today
   - transplant surgery aware
   - consider more lasix if pt becomes SOB
   # Anemia: Hct 20, mildly below baseline of 25. Thought to be
   combination of iron deficiency and CKD. Pt denies any blood in emesis
   or stools.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Cont iron supplement
   - Trend Hct with PM hct
   - Hold specimen ordered; transfuse for Hct <21
   - two units crossmatched
   # HTN: Poorly controlled. [**Month (only) 60**] be in setting of acute discomfort; also
   unable to tolerate home meds yesterday. Was restarted on home
   medications but persistently hypertensive likely in setting of anxiety,
   significant volume overload from fluids yesterday and uremia, chronic
   kidney disease
   - Continue home BP meds of metoprolol and amlodipine, will add
   additional agents PRN
   # Sinus tachycardia: Likely combination of discomfort and dehydration.
   No concerning findings on EKG.  Also could not tolerate his PO BB.
   - Supportive care as above

","The patient is a 32-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He has worsening renal failure and anion gap metabolic acidosis with concern for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient received intravenous fluids, bicarbonate, and an insulin drip, which helped to close his anion gap. 

The patient also has symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, possibly due to viral gastroenteritis or exacerbated by uremia. His abdominal examination is nonfocal with tenderness, and his lipase levels are normal. There is a mild elevation of liver function tests. 

The patient's blood sugar is elevated with an anion gap, initially concerning for DKA. His chronic renal failure has become acute on chronic, likely prerenal due to profuse nausea and vomiting. He received 2 liters of intravenous fluids in the emergency department and 5 liters in the medical intensive care unit, but caution is needed due to his renal function. 

The patient's hemoglobin concentration is mildly below baseline, thought to be a combination of iron deficiency and chronic kidney disease. He denies any blood in emesis or stools, and guaiac testing of all stools should be done. Iron supplements should be continued, and the patient's hematocrit should be trended with a point-of-care test. 

The patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled, possibly"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU for multiple medical conditions including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), chronic renal failure, depression, hypertension, and type I diabetes mellitus (DM). 

The patient was brought in by their girlfriend with worsening glycemic control, requiring the restart of insulin for glycemic control. The patient also has underlying depression and hypertension that requires medication adjustment. 

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, for which an AV fistula was placed and dialysis was initiated the previous day, which was tolerated well. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored.

The patient experienced nausea and vomiting, which improved significantly, possibly related to DKA or underlying gastroparesis. The patient also had an episode of diarrhea, which has since resolved.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 180/94 to 112/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, with values ranging from 436 mg/dL to 80 mg/dL after treatment. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while platelet count is within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of ineffective coping, type I diabetes mellitus, depression, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. He presented to the ICU with complaints of abdominal pain and high blood pressure. The patient's blood sugar levels were initially elevated at 436 mg/dL, so insulin was administered, and an insulin drip was started. His blood pressure remained high despite medication, reaching levels above 190 mmHg. The patient also had difficulty with calcium capsules due to their size and refused dinner. His fingersticks showed blood glucose levels between 66-219 mg/dL. C. Difficile (C. Diff) was sent for testing. The patient's allergies include penicillins, watermelon, almonds, and anaphylaxis. His last dose of antibiotics was on 02/21/2145.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels were initially very high at 436 mg/dL, but later dropped to the 130s after the administration of insulin. This indicates a risk for hypoglycemia if insulin dosage is not carefully monitored.
2. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's blood pressure remained consistently high, with readings above 190 mmHg. This poses a risk for hypertensive crisis and potential organ damage.
3. C. Difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and depression. He was admitted to the ICU due to abdominal pain and suspected diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's blood sugar levels were initially very high (436 mg/dL), and he required insulin infusion and was placed on an insulin drip. His blood sugar levels stabilized in the 130s, and the insulin drip was stopped.

The patient's blood pressure has been consistently elevated above 190 mmHg despite being on antihypertensive medications. He also has a history of gastroparesis, which may have contributed to his abdominal pain after consuming a meal from KFC. The pain resolved with the administration of morphine.

The patient underwent his first hemodialysis (HD) session on 02/20 and is expected to have a third session today. His creatinine levels have been fluctuating but remain elevated. He has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level near bilateral normal range, likely due to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's anemia will be managed with iron supplements and monitoring of Hct levels.

The patient's hypertension is poorly controlled, and his blood pressure remains in the 140-170 mmHg range. He was started on metoprolol 100 mg per renal recommendations, and no additional intravenous fluids will be given. The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, depression, chronic renal failure, hypertension, and previous episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea, which have all been resolved.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 165/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on several medications including furosemide, morphine sulfate, dextrose 50%, metoprolol, and heparin sodium.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 436 mg/dL to 70 mg/dL, as well as elevated serum creatinine levels ranging from 15.3 mg/dL to 11.5 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, but platelet count is slightly low.

The patient has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type I, depression, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. The patient has already experienced an episode of DKA, which has been resolved. The patient's chronic renal failure requires ongoing management and dialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 1 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, depression, and ineffective coping. He was admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and suspected diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has been uncooperative with medical recommendations, refusing breakfast before starting dialysis and refusing calcium capsules due to their size. He also has been non-compliant with insulin therapy, which has led to episodes of hyperglycemia. The patient's blood pressure remains poorly controlled despite medication adjustments. His abdominal pain, initially thought to be related to DKA, was resolved with morphine and an EKG showed no evidence of ischemia. The patient's Hct level is low, indicating anemia likely secondary to chronic kidney disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of type 1 diabetes and high blood glucose levels indicate a risk for DKA. Close monitoring of blood glucose and ketone levels is essential.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains poorly controlled, posing a risk for cardiovascular complications such as stroke or heart attack.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's low Hct level suggests anemia secondary to CKD. Regular monitoring of kidney function and management of anemia with iron supplements are necessary.
4. Gastroparesis: The patient's abdominal pain, likely exacerbated by a K"
