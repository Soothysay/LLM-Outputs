","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia. He presented from Hospital6 with a likely large territory NSTEMI. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization at Hospital3, which showed diffuse three-vessel disease and is being evaluated for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient may have experienced a large territory NSTEMI or STEMI equivalent due to new left bundle branch block (LBBB) related to ischemia. An echocardiogram revealed areas of hypokinesis in the left anterior descending (LAD) territory, corresponding to a 90% lesion. The left circumflex artery (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA) disease may be chronic.

The plan includes continuing eptifibatide, heparin, and aspirin, changing simvastatin to atorvastatin, initiating a beta-blocker, holding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) due to borderline blood pressure, and reviewing angiography films with the cardiothoracic surgery team.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing congestive heart failure (CHF) with pulmonary edema. The initial chest x-ray did not show any clear infiltrate. The plan is to treat with diuresis and"

He presented with likely large territory NSTEMI and underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed diffuse 3 vessel disease. The patient is being evaluated for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

The patient experienced an episode of increased work of respiration overnight and was placed on non-rebreather, saturating at 100% with a respiratory rate of 25-30 breaths per minute. An arterial blood gas (ABG) was obtained, and a repeat chest x-ray is pending. There is a suspicion of worsening fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate (HR) of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 95/63 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient has a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and is on several infusions, including heparin sodium, eptifibatide (Integrilin), and nitroglycerin.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old male diabetic, former smoker, CAD, hyperlipidemia who
   presents from [**Hospital6 1986**] with large territory NSTEMI. Patient
   is s/p cardiac catherization at [**Hospital3 337**] which demonstrates diffuse
   3 vessel disease, being evaluated for CABG.
   # Acute coronary syndrome - Given large CK leak, this may represent
   large territory NSTEMI vs. STEMI equivalent if LBBB is new and related
   to ischemia.  Echocardiographic areas of hypokinesis at OSH most
   suggestive of LAD territory, which correlates with 90% lesion in LAD
   territory.  LCx and RCA disease may be chronic, though this is
   unclear.  Started on eptifibatide.
   - Cont. eptifibatide, heparin gtt, continue ASA
   - Cont. atorvastatin 80mg
   - start beta blocker given HTN and significant coronary artery disease
   - Consider low-dose ACE if blood pressure is stable, holding for now
   given BP borderline and trying to diurese.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from cardiothoracic surgery aware, and plan to review
   angiography films with team in AM
   - f/u surgery recs regarding plans
   - Trend biomarkers, ECG, telemetry
   # Respiratory failure - Likely CHF as below, however infectious
   etiologies in differential as well given fever and leukocytosis
   (however this could also be [**3-19**] acute MI).  Treating with diuresis,
   holding off on antibiotics as no clear infiltrate on chest x-ray.
   Patient had some respiratory distress overnight, placed on NRB.  CXR
   showed worsening pulm. Edema. Received 40mg IV lasix with good UOP and
   breathing improved.  Resp. status also improved with HR control.
   - Repeat CXR this am
   - Decrease nitro gtt to give more room in BP for diuresis
   - Goal I/O -1-2L with prn lasix
   - consider Levaquin for treatment of community acquired pneumonia if
   clinically suspect
   .
   # PUMP:  Ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF, unclear
   whether he also has chronic component.  Elevated PCWP on cardiac
   catheterization.
   - Diuresis for I/O -1-2L as tolerated by blood pressure
   - cont aspirin, statin, beta blocker
   - Holding ACE-I
   - Repeat echocardiogram in AM
   # Acute renal failure - Unclear baseline. Cr stable at 1.4 today.
   - Obtain records from PCP if able
   - Monitor electrolytes, renally dose medications
   - Cont. to follow
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus rhythm.
   # Diabetes mellitus - holding metformin and giving insulin sliding
   scale while in house
   - diabetic diet

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, former smoking, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hyperlipidemia. He presents with large territory non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and has undergone cardiac catheterization demonstrating diffuse 3-vessel disease. The patient is being evaluated for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's current condition includes acute coronary syndrome, respiratory failure, pump failure, and acute renal failure. The respiratory failure is likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), but infectious etiologies are also considered given the presence of fever and leukocytosis. The patient has been treated with diuretics, and there is an improvement in breathing with good urine output.

The pump failure is attributed to ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute systolic CHF. The patient's pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) on cardiac catheterization is elevated. The management plan includes diuretics for fluid balance, continuation of aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker therapy, and holding ACE inhibitors.

The acute renal failure is unclear whether it is a baseline condition or an acute issue. The creatinine level is stable at 1.4, and monitoring of electrolytes and medications is recommended. Repeat echocardiogram in the morning is planned.

Other findings include sinus rhythm, diabetes mellitus, and an overall assessment of the patient"
