   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   (Called tonight)
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer. He presents with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway protection. The patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma and had hematuria requiring re-admission. He also has a history of gout and anemia. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, rhythm disturbances, transitional cell carcinoma with hematuria, CAD, congestive heart failure, GERD, COPD, history of gout, renal insufficiency, anemia, and a DNR/DNI code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's dependant lung findings on imaging raise concern for aspiration pneumonia. He is being treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pathogens.
2. Seizure: The patient's altered mental status and irregularly irregular heart rhythm could suggest a seizure. An EEG is planned to investigate this possibility.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has had recent instrumentation of the urinary tract, which increases the risk of infection. Urine and blood cultures have been obtained.
4. Pneumothorax: Given the patient's history of COPD and intubation, there is a risk of developing a pneumothorax. Monitoring for"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings.
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKSs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   (Called tonight)
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

The patient has several medical complications, including pneumonia, arrhythmia, transitional cell carcinoma, and renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is a concern, and the differential diagnosis includes infection, arrhythmia, seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD, and stroke.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to concerns about his mental status, and he may have developed hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Arrhythmia: The patient appears to be in an accelerated idioventricular rhythm on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. This could be related to hypoxia, reperfusion, or this could be the patient's baseline.
4. Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria: The patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma and has ongoing hematuria.
5. Congestive heart failure: The patient has a normal ejection fraction and does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
6. GERD: The patient continues on PPI for GERD.
7. COPD: The patient continues on home nebs and advair for COPD.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection, successfully extubated yesterday.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Still remains unclear what prompted acute
   mental status change. Most likely was secondary to infection +/- COPD
   with CO2 retention. Differential at time of admission included
   infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source in setting
   of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia, seizure, retention
   of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of admission AFTER
   intubation demonstrated hypercarbia), or stroke
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens, on
   vanco/zosyn/azithromycin (day 4 of abx)
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
none noted
   - Culture data negative to date
   - Appreciate Neuro assistance
   - MRI brain: no evidence of acute stroke or lesions
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; should
   likely re-attempt to rule out leptomeningeal spread of malignancy,
   although this is less likely to account for acute change given
   improvement without significant intervention.
   - EEG did not suggest seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status, successfully extubated yesterday.
   -          Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent
   admission), added azithromycin today (today is day 4 of vanco/zosyn),
   will complete 7 day course.
   -          When patient was seen on rounds, appeared to have some
   wheezes. In conjunction with CXR, appears more of a fluid
   overloaded/pulm edema state, so will diuresis (home dose 20 mg lasix)
   with 40 mg IV lasix, change albuterol nebs to standing and PRN, and
   consider steroids if wheezing is not improved with diuresis.
   -          Checking urinary legionella antigen.
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. Old
   EKGs demonstrate this is not a new finding. He has been ruled out for
   MI.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia and diuresis today
   (and wheezing), will add back BB if BP tolerates today or tomorrow
   given history of CAD.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, currently on slower CBI without
   any hematuria.
   - Appreciate urology assistance, recommended CBI until urine clear/pink
   (with TCC resection, CBI better to help scar form and stop hematuria)
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home. Ruled out for MI.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded,
   but CXR could be consistent with CHF
   - Given CXR and wheezing this AM, giving IV lasix with goal of net out
   today.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides. Today is improved to 1.3.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Slightly down today. Will hold off on transfusion as he does
   not have significant hematuria, but transfuse if <25 or symptoms. Given
   B12 was borderline low, will check MMA. Continuing iron
   supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend.
   .
   #) FEN: Concern for aspiration by nursing staff, requesting speech and
   swallow evalutation.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI (changing to PO given no evidence of GIB).
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer. He presents with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway protection, and successfully extubated yesterday. The patient is still experiencing some mental status changes, which could be due to infection, COPD with CO2 retention, arrhythmia, seizure, or stroke. He is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status changes may be attributed to infection, COPD with CO2 retention, arrhythmia, seizure, or stroke. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure. Although he was successfully extubated yesterday, he still requires respiratory support and is being treated for pneumonia and pulmonary edema.

3. Rhythm disturbances: The patient appears to have an accelerated idioventricular rhythm on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. He has been ruled out for myocardial infarction.

4. Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria: The patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma and had hematuria requiring re-admission. Monitoring hematuria and urology assistance are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with unknown weight. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2166-11-13**] and has shown improvement in mental status. The patient was extubated around 230 pm and remained on the sleepy side for the rest of the day. The post-extubation ABG results showed pH 7.39, PaCO2 42 mmHg, and PaO2 94 mmHg. The preliminary EEG results were normal. The MRI revealed no evidence of acute infarct or enhancing brain lesion, but did show a dilated flow void in the distal right vertebral artery suggestive of a dolichoectatic aneurysm.

The patient has received various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), multivitamin, Flovent, iron, colace, simvastatin, and Atrovent/Albuterol nebs. The patient's allergies are documented as well.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate between 78-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/49 to 133/94 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20-25 inspiratory movements per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.
