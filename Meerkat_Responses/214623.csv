   Assessment and Plan
   COPD
   CAD s/p CABG
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   1.       Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with known
   severe oxygen dependent COPD.  Over the course of this morning she has
   deteriorated initially from a primary hypoxemia
 likely due to RLL
   collapse and volume overload- then evolved into hypercarbia. Her ABG
   showed an uncompensated resp academia and she was beginning to become
   somnolent. We elected to intubate felling she did have the mental
   status to even trial BIPAP.
   Vent: start with AC low tidal volumes and see if she can covert to PSV
   quickly this AM
   HAP: Vanco/Meropenem- send sputum cultures
   COPD: increase to [**Hospital1 **] Medrol, ATC MDIs
   Volume Overload: goal 500 to 1000cc negative as BP tolerate
   Place Aline for hemodynamics and freq ABGs
   2.  GIB:  Persistent dark guaiac positive stools.  Hct 24.0.  No
   documentation of NGT lavage.  Hemodynamically stable here.  Guaiac
   stools, serial CBC's, IV PPI, active type and screen, will transfuse
   one unit this AM for Hct < 25.
   Per DR [**First Name (STitle) 7116**] who was called from OSH- she had an EGD there which was neg
   and she had a C scope last year which was clean. OSH GI attg feels that
   IR would be next step so if she dose re bleed we will discuss with IR
   bleeding scan versus Angio looking for lower source.
   3. Acute renal failure in setting of hypotension, most likely ATN as
   felt by outside MD's.  Resolving with improved urine output and Cr.
   Monitor I/Os with foley, daily Cr.
   4.  Afib: Rate better controlled after metoprolol.  Restart metoprolol,
   diltiazem.  Hold on anticoagulation for now in setting of GIB.
   5.  Thrombocytopenia:  Felt to be secondary to zosyn at OSH, counts
   have improved after stopping this med.  Not clear if she had heparin,
   or antibodies checked.  Will hold on heparin products here for now and
   check for antibodies.  Follow counts.
   6.       CAD:  Has had chest tightness albeit notes this has been
   present since extubation.  No acute changes on ECG except flattened
   twaves in setting of RVR.  Will trend enzymes.  Cntinue simvastatin,
   beta blocker as above. Not on outpt ASA and has GI bleed but if acute
   ischemia OK for ASA>
   7.       Back Wound: Burn from OSH heating pad, silvadine,   wound care
   consult  in AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleed. He presented to the ICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure due to severe oxygen-dependent COPD, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), thrombocytopenia, and coronary artery disease with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure with known severe oxygen-dependent COPD. The patient was intubated due to deteriorating mental status and hypoxemia. Ventilation parameters were adjusted, and plans were made to convert to pressure support ventilation (PSV) if possible.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient had persistent dark guaiac-positive stools, low hemoglobin levels, and no documentation of nasogastric tube lavage. He was hemodynamically stable, and serial complete blood counts (CBCs) were ordered. Intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was administered, and the patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a hemoglobin level below 25"

- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 140/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%.
- The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a chest X-ray showing right lower lobe collapse, right effusion, and pulmonary edema.
- Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- The patient's current assessment includes acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.
- The plan includes initiating mechanical ventilation, administering antibiotics, treating COPD exacerbation, managing volume overload, transfusing blood products, controlling heart rate, and monitoring for complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's deteriorating respiratory status, along with the presence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, increases the risk of ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, positive cultures, and signs of systemic inflammatory"

   Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure now transferred for
   management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  No extubated since [**2154-11-5**] and doing
   well.  ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis which is well
   compensated.  Poor air movement on exam.  On 3L nasal cannula at home,
   currently satting 95% on 4L.  CXR with evidence of volume overload.
   - transition to prednisone 60 mg daily
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   - titrate oxygen for saturations > 90%
   - completed 5 day course of azithromycin
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.0.  Currently 1.5 down from
   2.6 on presentation to [**Location (un) **] on [**2154-11-4**].  Currently making good
   urine ouput.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding, acute respiratory failure, and other medical complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/38-196/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode set at CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including gastrointestinal bleeding, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. She also has a history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG and aortic valve replacement.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of atrial fibrillation, further gastrointestinal bleeding, development of pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, deterioration of renal function, and potential thromboembolic events due to thrombocytopenia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, and respiratory status. The need for ongoing assessment and management of the patient's multiple comorbidities should be prioritized. Frequent communication"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She presented to OSH on 11/4/2154 with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was transferred for management of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient was extubated on 11/5/2154 but re-intubated on 11/10/2154 due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis which is well compensated. Poor air movement on exam. Currently, she is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 40%.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.0, and it is now 1.5. This decrease from 2.6 on presentation to [Location (un)] on 11/4/2154 is thought to be ATN. The patient is currently making good urine output. Renal dosing of medications should be continued, and PT/PTT/INR should be monitored.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been having dark guaiac positive stools since admission to [Location (un)]. Her hematocrit on admission was 19.4, and she received 2 units of packed red blood cells. Her hematocrit is currently 27.2. She is hemodynamically stable. A type and screen should be performed, and triple lumen for access should be established. Transfusion goal should be >25, and IV PPI should be given. A GI consult should be obtained, and prior records from [Location (un)] regarding past endoscopies should be obtained.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear. It was initially thought to be secondary to Zosyn, but the platelet count is now increasing from a nadir of 56 to 79. PF4 antibodies should be followed up, heparin products should be held, and the platelet count should be monitored. Transfusion for platelets <50 should be considered while actively bleeding.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was in rapid ventricular response on admission, which improved with IV metoprolol. She is currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. Diltiazem should be titrated up as tolerated, and the patient should continue on metoprolol at 12.5 mg [Hospital1].

6. Coronary Artery Disease s/p CABG: The patient complains of chest tightness in the setting of rapid ventricular rates. Troponins are slightly elevated at 0.2. EKG without ischemic"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and suspected aspiration. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on multiple medications including solumedrol, vancomycin, meropenem, pantoprazole, and furosemide.

On review of systems, the patient has bradycardia. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure of 153/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400-450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 66, PaO2 of 207, and HCO3- of 82 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals an awake and alert patient with a clear oropharynx, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and irregularly irregular heartbeat consistent with atrial fibrillation. The patient also has a stage II decubitus ulcer on the back and faint erythematous"

The patient received 2 units of blood with minimal improvement in hematocrit levels. Foley catheter replacement was done due to blood-tinged urine. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient was given midazolam (versed) at 1 mg/hour, pantoprazole (protonix), furosemide (lasix), and other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current issue of bradycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and suspected aspiration. This condition can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Continued bleeding can cause further deterioration in hemodynamic status and lead to anemia and hypotension.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. These ulcers can become infected and lead to serious complications such as cellulitis or sepsis.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's presenting complaint is bradycardia. If not appropriately managed, bradycardia can lead to decreased"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG and aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She presented to OSH with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was transferred for management of gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been intubated multiple times due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 153/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature of 36.8 C. She has an elevated JVP, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and faint wheezing at end expiration. Her lab results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has several medical complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure, back wound, and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and the presence of pulmonary edema, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and aortic valve replacement. She presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred for management of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been intubated twice due to respiratory failure and has shown improvement in oxygen saturation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs are stable, but she has an elevated JVP and faint wheezing at end expiration. The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hyperlipidemia. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and aortic valve replacement. The patient's medical complications include hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and diastolic congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper mouth care and elevation of the head of bed should be implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as pneumatic compression boots should be used.
3. Stress"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG and aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She presented to OSH with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially extubated but then re-intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis which is well compensated. She has evidence of volume overload on the CXR. She has dark guaiac positive stools since admission, received 2 units of packed red blood cells, and her hematocrit is currently 27.2. Her platelet count is increasing from a nadir of 56. She has a stage II decubitus ulcer on her back from a burn injury. She has an active type and screen due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Her current medications include solumedrol, vancomycin, pantoprazole, furosemide, and simvastatin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates inadequate ventilation leading to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This can result in respiratory acidosis and may lead to further complications such as hypoxemia and increased intracranial pressure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.0, but it has increased to 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure; GI bleed
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, but good progress.  Emirical
   antimicrobials, increased steroids, and diuresis.  Underlying COPD and
   left hemidiaphragm paralysis.  Hope to work towards extubation trial.
   GI BLEED -- stable clinically.  Source remains unclear.  s/p 2 U PRBC.
   GI consulation defers EGD at present.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- improved.  D/C digoxin.
   A-FIB -- improved control.  Currently NSR.  metoprolol and diltiazem.
   Digoxin on hold.
   AS -- s/p AVR (bioprosthetic)
   CAD -- s/p revascularization.
   NUTRITIONAL -- TF
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- chronic insufficiency, improved.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to antimicrobials (Zosyn)

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and remains mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 171/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's review of systems is negative for any other significant symptoms or complaints. Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, with no signs of distress or acute abnormalities. 

Laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, the creatinine level is elevated at 1.6 mg/dL, indicating possible renal dysfunction. Electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, with the exception of slightly low potassium at 3.1 mEq/L. 

The patient's medication regimen includes antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem), diuretics (furosemide), and a proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole). 

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, digoxin toxicity, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, nutritional support, fluid balance, and renal function. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and nosocomial infections due to the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure; GI bleed
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent, but good progress.  Emirical
   antimicrobials, increased steroids, and diuresis.  Underlying COPD and
   left hemidiaphragm paralysis.  Hope to work towards extubation trial.
   GI BLEED -- stable clinically.  Source remains unclear.  s/p 2 U PRBC.
   GI consulation defers EGD at present.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- improved.  D/C digoxin.
   A-FIB -- improved control.  Currently NSR.  metoprolol and diltiazem.
   Digoxin on hold.
   AS -- s/p AVR (bioprosthetic)
   CAD -- s/p revascularization.
   NUTRITIONAL -- TF
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- chronic insufficiency, improved.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to antimicrobials (Zosyn)

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, left hemidiaphragm paralysis, and various other comorbidities such as digoxin toxicity, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem). They have received blood products and fluids, indicating potential bleeding or low platelet count.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The arterial blood gas results indicate a pH within normal limits, but there may be some abnormalities in electrolyte levels and lactate.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels appear mostly within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of abuse. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with no wheezing or crackles. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable except for a distant second heart sound. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds.

The patient's neurological examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and aortic valve replacement. She presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. She also has acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease post CABG, aortic valve replacement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure, and a back wound.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and previous episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's dark guaiac positive stools suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and require blood transfusions.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and improvement in urine output suggest acute renal failure, which may require renal replacement therapy.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the context of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response may require anticoagulation and rate control measures.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress/failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- insufficient progress on BiPAP since
   extubation.  Concern for COPD exacerbation, perhaps CHF, on background
   of left hemidiaphragm paresis.  Plan to repeat intubation to protect
   airway and assist ventilation.  Monitor ABG.  F/U CXR.  Would check
   cardiac echo.  Need to consider trach if no obvious rapidly reversible
   etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Monitor Hct serially.
   A-FIB -- recurrent.  Improved control with prn beta-blocker.  Monitor
   HR.  r/o MI protocol.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- replete free H2O to Na < 147.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with respiratory distress and was initially placed on invasive ventilation. They were later extubated but required non-invasive ventilation due to continued ventilatory distress. The patient experienced some secretions and anxiety, for which they received Ativan. They also had tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, treated with Lopressor. A right femoral line was placed for venous access.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to no known medications, with recent doses of vancomycin and meropenem. They were receiving various ICU medications, including furosemide, metoprolol, lorazepam, and pantoprazole.

Review of systems revealed no constitutional symptoms, eye abnormalities, ear, nose, throat issues, cardiovascular problems, nutritional support concerns, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal issues, genitourinary problems, musculoskeletal complaints, integumentary (skin) abnormalities, endocrine disturbances, heme/lymph concerns, or neurologic symptoms. Allergies/Immunology and signs for abuse were also unremarkable.

Vital signs included a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 78 bpm (with a range of 61-102 bpm), blood pressure of 179/74 mmHg (with a range of 118/47-183/79 mmHg), respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (with a range"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress/failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- insufficient progress on BiPAP since
   extubation.  Concern for COPD exacerbation, perhaps CHF, on background
   of left hemidiaphragm paresis.  Plan to repeat intubation to protect
   airway and assist ventilation.  Monitor ABG.  F/U CXR.  Would check
   cardiac echo.  Need to consider trach if no obvious rapidly reversible
   etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Monitor Hct serially.
   A-FIB -- recurrent.  Improved control with prn beta-blocker.  Monitor
   HR.  r/o MI protocol.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- replete free H2O to Na < 147.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual experiencing respiratory distress and failure. They were previously intubated but were extubated and required non-invasive ventilation due to ventilatory distress. The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation and left hemidiaphragm paresis. There are concerns about potential complications such as cardiogenic shock, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and hypernatremia. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and a previous episode of digoxin toxicity. The patient's condition remains unstable, and further interventions are required.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress indicates a high risk for respiratory failure. Immediate action needs to be taken to protect the airway and assist ventilation.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of COPD exacerbation and atrial fibrillation, there is a possibility of cardiogenic shock. Monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac enzymes will be crucial.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's compromised respiratory status increases the risk of pneumonia. Close monitoring for fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum should be done.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored due to the suspicion of pre-renal azotemia caused by net diuresis. Holding on net diuresis and checking cardiac echo are recommended.

5. Hypernatrem"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was transferred to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She also has a history of impaired skin integrity, possibly due to her prolonged stay in the ICU.

Other medical conditions include acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease status post CABG. The patient has a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and is not currently anticoagulated. She also has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diastolic congestive heart failure.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Her platelet count is increasing from a previous low level, and she has been on a heparin product hold. Her blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 163/66 mmHg, heart rate of 71 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed, which has resulted in a drop in her hematocrit levels. She has received blood transfusions and is currently on a type and screen for future transfusions. She is also on proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's medication regimen includes fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, lopressor, digoxin, atropine, and various other medications for her medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, worsening renal function, bleeding complications due to the gastrointestinal bleed, and cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially extubated but then reintubated due to the respiratory failure. The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and a history of aortic valve replacement. She is currently on various medications including anticoagulants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and statins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates difficulty in exchanging carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) in the lungs. This can lead to increased levels of CO2 in the bloodstream, affecting the pH balance and causing acidosis.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing dark guaiac positive stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to anemia, hypotension, and shock if not properly managed.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1.0 has increased to 1.7, indicating acute renal failure. This can be caused by factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has"

   Respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 improved following re-intubation.  Suspect
   component of COPD and pulmonary hypertension.  Concern for cardiac
   etiology for respiratory failure, such as cardiac ischemia
 pulmonary
   edema.  Also with valvular heart disease
 s/p AVR.  Need to optimize
   cardiac function.  Otherwise, need to consider trach if no obvious
   rapidly reversible etiology determined.

   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   Consider imaging to further assess.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's condition has shown improvement following re-intubation. There are concerns about the underlying cause of respiratory failure, including COPD, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac ischemia, pulmonary edema, and valvular heart disease post-aortic valve replacement (AVR). Optimizing cardiac function is essential. The patient also has anemia, bradycardia related to medication, atrial fibrillation, groin hematoma, renal failure, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and a past episode of digoxin toxicity. The patient requires nutritional support and is receiving it through tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and ongoing mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of AVR and suspected cardiac etiology for respiratory failure increase the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia.
3. Renal Complications: The patient is suspected to have renal failure, which may progress further due to inadequate renal perfusion and ongoing net diuresis.
4. Hematological Complications: The patient has thrombocytopenia and a groin hematoma, indicating a risk of bleeding complications.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: Given the patient's critical condition and prolonged immobility, there is a risk of stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to the invasive lines and tubes in place.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient requires nutritional support, but there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia and poor nutritional status leading to further complications.

Please note that these potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on non-invasive ventilation but required invasive ventilation due to worsening respiratory failure. The patient also experienced bradycardia following beta-blocker dosing. The patient has multiple medical conditions including COPD, pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease after aortic valve replacement (AVR), anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, hypernatremia, and digoxin toxicity. The patient is also receiving nutritional support through tube feeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, pulmonary edema, further thrombocytopenia, worsening renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and infection related to the presence of various lines and tubes.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, cardiac function, renal function, and electrolyte levels. Appropriate measures should be taken to optimize the patient's cardiac function and address any underlying causes of respiratory failure. Regular assessment and management of the patient's nutritional needs are also important."

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD who presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was transferred to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been extubated multiple times but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

Her current medical conditions include acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, impaired skin integrity, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure, and a back wound.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/62 mmHg to 170/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including prednisone, carvedilol, lasix, prevacid, vancomycin, meropenem, fentanyl, midazolam, and simvastatin.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of sodium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, lactic acid, and troponin-T, while her hemoglobin has decreased from 28.7 to 25.6. Her platelet"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and previous surgeries (CABG and aortic valve replacement). She presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was transferred to this hospital for management of gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her current conditions include acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure, and a back wound.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and repeated episodes of respiratory failure suggest a high risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ARDS.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding poses a risk of anemia, hypotension, and further bleeding.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which could progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering her current gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and previous surgeries including CABG and aortic valve replacement. She presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was transferred to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation and extubation. She currently has a confirmed diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding and acute renal failure, as well as thrombocytopenia. The patient's atrial fibrillation has improved with IV metoprolol, and she has a history of coronary artery disease post CABG. She also has a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and has not been anticoagulated. The patient has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and evidence of diastolic congestive heart failure with volume overload.

Other medical issues include a back wound with a stage II ulcer and the need for wound care consultation. The patient is receiving nutrition through fibersource HN and has a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has arterial and PICC lines in place, along with prophylaxis measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of gastrointestinal bleeding, further deterioration of renal function"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG and aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She presented to OSH with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred to [**Hospital1**] for management of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory failure and has a history of dark guaiac positive stools since admission. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**11-10**] and her hematocrit dropped slightly overnight from 28.7 to 25.6 without any bloody BM. Currently, she is hemodynamically stable. The patient's platelet count has been increasing from a nadir of 56 to 113, and PF4 antibodies are negative this admission. She has impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.0 and currently 1.5, and diastolic congestive heart failure with volume overload on CXR. The patient also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a back wound with stage II ulcer from a burn injury. She is currently receiving various medications including prednisone, Vanc/[**Last Name (un)**], and carvedilol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of dark guaiac positive stools"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and recent aortic valve replacement. She presented with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. She also has renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and repeated episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Monitoring oxygenation, ventilation, and weaning from mechanical ventilation will be crucial.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing dark guaiac positive stools since admission. This suggests ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic status, blood products, and transfusion requirements is necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.0, but it increased to 1.5 yesterday. This indicates a decline in renal function. Close monitoring of renal function, fluid balance, and medication dosing adjustments are essential.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has had a low platelet count, which has improved from a nadir of 56 to 106. Monitoring platelet count and considering transfusion for platelets below 50 or active bleeding is important"

   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred here [**11-9**]
   for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and previous surgeries (CABG and aortic valve replacement). She presented to the hospital with hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for various complications including pneumonia, cardiac issues, COPD exacerbation, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains intubated on mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show some abnormalities in kidney function, liver function, electrolytes, and blood cell counts. She is receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including antibiotics for pneumonia, cardiac medications, and diuretics for fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation and symptoms suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to worsening pneumonia and respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous cardiac surgeries. Her symptoms of hypertension and tachycardia indicate potential cardiac complications that need close monitoring and management.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This may require further investigation and intervention to prevent or manage acute renal failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 improved following re-intubation.  Suspect
   component of COPD and pulmonary hypertension.  Concern for cardiac
   etiology for respiratory failure, such as cardiac ischemia
 pulmonary
   edema.  Also with valvular heart disease s/p AVR.  Need to optimize
   cardiac function.  Otherwise, need to consider trach if no obvious
   rapidly reversible etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor Hct
   serially.  No plans for endoscopy at this time.
   BRADYCARDIA
 pharmacological related.  Now off beta-blockers.
   A-FIB/FLUTTER -- recurrent A-fib, now flutter.  Rate control with
   Diltiazem.  Consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy.  Continue
   transfusion to Hct >28.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   Consider imaging to further assess.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor Digoxin level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. There are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac Etiology for Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to cardiac ischemia or pulmonary edema, especially considering the history of valvular heart disease after an aortic valve replacement (AVR). Optimizing cardiac function is necessary.

2. Tracheostomy: If no obvious rapidly reversible etiology for respiratory failure is determined, consideration should be given to performing a tracheostomy.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is clinically stable, but there is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring guiac stool and serial hematocrit levels should be continued. Endoscopy is not planned at this time.

4. Bradycardia: The patient experienced bradycardia, which was pharmacological-related. The patient is now off beta-blockers.

5. Atrial Flutter/Fibrillation: The patient has recurrent atrial flutter/fibrillation. Rate control with diltiazem is being used, and consideration should be given to anticoagulation.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy. Continued transfusion to maintain a hematocrit level above 28% is recommended.

7. Groin Hematoma: The patient has a larger left groin hematoma compared"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 improved following re-intubation.  Suspect
   component of COPD and pulmonary hypertension.  Concern for cardiac
   etiology for respiratory failure, such as cardiac ischemia
 pulmonary
   edema.  Also with valvular heart disease s/p AVR.  Need to optimize
   cardiac function.  Otherwise, need to consider trach if no obvious
   rapidly reversible etiology determined.
   GI BLEED -- clinically stable.  Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor Hct
   serially.  No plans for endoscopy at this time.
   BRADYCARDIA
 pharmacological related.  Now off beta-blockers.
   A-FIB/FLUTTER -- recurrent A-fib, now flutter.  Rate control with
   Diltiazem.  Consider anticoagulation.
   ANEMIA
 attributed to groin hematoma and phlebotomy.  Continue
   transfusion to Hct >28.
   HEMATOMA, Groin -- L >> R.  Clinically stable.  Attributed to
   thrombocytopenia, and perhaps instrumentation vs. spontaneous.
   Consider imaging to further assess.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect related to net diuresis (pre-renal).  Would
   hold on net diuresis, check Cardiac Echo.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- improving.  Attributed to medications.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- resolved.  Monitor Digoxin level.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have developed atrial flutter and are currently on diltiazem for rate control. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 175/70 to 120/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for hyperglycemia.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to a combination of COPD and pulmonary hypertension. There is also concern for cardiac etiology such as cardiac ischemia or pulmonary edema, especially considering the history of valvular heart disease post-aortic valve replacement (AVR). Optimizing cardiac function is necessary, and if no obvious rapidly reversible etiology is determined, tracheostomy may be considered.

2. GI Bleed: The patient is clinically stable, and no plans for endoscopy are currently being made."

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow

   tachycardia/afib. Has now failed extubation and weaning trials.  Is
   likely heading toward trach

   Agree with plan to;
        Continue to optimize volume and cardiac status, though would hold
   on additional diuresis for now and allow auto-diruesis.  Has developed
   sig resp alkalosis with known chronic CO2 retention which likely
   further prevented successful wean.  If unable to meet neg fluid balance
   would consider diamox.  As did not tolerate wean
would rest on ACV at
   this time.  Will taper prednisone and continue MDIs, sx, and pulm

        Renal failure improving slowly and now with good urine.
        Anemia stable (s/p 1 unit transfusion) suspect multifactorial
   etiology with slow GIB, hematoma, phlebotomy.  GI has signed off
   without plans for scope. Continue to guiac stool.  Monitor hematoma on
   groin and back.  Follow h/h, keeping active T and C, and consider
   obtaining abd/pelvic CT to eval for RP bleed if continued drop. Did
   show appropriate response to transfusion.
        Thrombocytopenia stable and felt likely [**12-22**] med effecrt.  Continue
   to monitor.
        Bradycardia recurrent after resuming BB and dilt for a-fib rate
   control.  Will decrease dilt dose and continue coreg for now monitoring
   closely.  Off dig (dig toxic at admit). Continue to hold anticoag given
   thrombocytopenia and anemia.
        Continue ICU prophylaxis.  Has picc line for access. .  Self-d/c'd

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post CABG and AVR, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the hospital for hypercarbic respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She has failed extubation attempts twice and is currently intubated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure put her at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which can lead to worsening renal failure and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be a result of gastrointestinal bleeding or other factors. If left untreated, it can lead to further complications like tissue hypoxia and poor tissue perfusion.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering her history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of anticoagulants.
5. Hyperglycemia: Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections and other complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hypergly"

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented to the hospital with hypercarbic respiratory failure and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to failure to extubate, likely caused by infectious pneumonia, cardiac issues such as hypertension and underlying congestive heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema, and COPD. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a back wound from a burn injury.

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with a history of coronary artery
   disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation and
   COPD on home oxygen who presented to OSH on [**2154-11-4**] with hypotension,
   bradycardia and hypercarbic respiratory failure transferred here [**11-9**]
   for management of gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] day 5 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -Increase Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Lasix Diuresis for net -1L
   -transfuse 1unit PRBCs for HCT >25 given evidence of end organ ischemia
   (cardiac)
   -possible to extubate patient on IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash
   edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.
   .
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable.  No EGD only evidence for GI
   bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - holding heparin products
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
    .
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   -start dilt 30 PO QID ([**11-21**] daily home dose)
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   .
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG and AVR, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. The patient presented to the hospital with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU for management of GI bleed.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory failure.
- Pneumonia: The patient is being treated empirically for nosocomial pneumonia with vancomycin.
- Cardiac optimization: The patient's beta-blocker dose has been increased, and diuretics are being used to optimize cardiac function.
- Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have returned to baseline, indicating improvement.
- Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has guaiac positive stool, indicating active bleeding. Transfusion and blood product support are being provided.
- Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is increasing after a nadir of 56. Heparin products have been held, and daily platelet checks are being performed.
- Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently not anticoagulated due to GI bleeding. Bradycardia and tachycardia fluctuations have been observed.
- Coronary artery disease: The patient had CABG surgery with LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA. EKG shows no ischemic changes.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She also has atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted from another hospital with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred for the management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient's initial vital signs were as follows: temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate (HR) of 78 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) of 135/54 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 70 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm was noted to be atrial flutter.

The patient has been receiving various medications including carvedilol, diltiazem, furosemide, lasix, lansoprazole, lactulose, midazolam, fentanyl, and insulin sliding scale. She is also on a ventilator with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 35%, and a pressure-controlled mode with a plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O.

   Assessment and Plan
Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]

   status to DNR. While consider trach for now if there is possibility of
   weaning patient off the vent. Otherwise, if unable to wean off vent,
   patient would prefer not to be on vent indefinitely and would prefer
   adding DNI/CMO status.
   Code status: DNR
   Disposition: in ICU while intubated
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted from an outside hospital (OSH) on [date] with hypercarbic respiratory failure and transferred to this hospital for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient has had multiple episodes of failure to extubate while admitted, including being extubated twice and then reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Her medical conditions include:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, involving infectious (pneumonia), cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia, and underlying congestive heart failure causing flash pulmonary edema), and COPD factors. She is quite alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine has returned to baseline at 1.0, with good urine output. She was previously thought to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN) but is now back to baseline.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is decreasing despite receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday."

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the operating room on [**11-4**] with hypercarbic respiratory failure and later transferred for management of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. She is currently on a combination of bipap and intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV).

The patient's current medications include carvedilol, diltiazem, furosemide (Lasix), lansoprazole, lactulose, midazolam (Versed), and fentanyl. She is also receiving insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and receiving enteral nutrition through Fibersource HN.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed. These include hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a back wound.

The plan of care includes optimizing cardiac function, managing COPD exacerbation, treating pneumonia, managing acute renal failure, treating gastrointestinal bleeding, addressing thrombocytopenia,"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABB and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Quite
   alkalotic on ABG today, likely contraction alkalosis from overdiuresis.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid 40 PO BID today, then 20 PO BID tomorrow
   continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t

   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, presenting for management of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation, including hypercarbic respiratory failure and pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient also has impaired skin integrity, likely due to a large ecchymosis surrounding her left upper leg. 

She has a history of acute renal failure, which has since returned to baseline, and thrombocytopenia, which is improving with ongoing monitoring. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently not being anticoagulated due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, but it is being monitored and managed with beta-blockers. 

Her coronary artery disease is being managed with ongoing medication adjustments, including the use of simvastatin and metoprolol/ Coreg for blood pressure control. 

The patient has a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and is not anticoagulated. 

She also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a back wound with a stage II ulcer. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through fiber source HN and glyc"

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid Pred 20 PO daily today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco (today is last day) /[**Last Name (un) **] day 7 (of 8) for empiric coverate of
   nosomial pna
   - sputum cx pending
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -cont Coreg to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - decreased dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox Diuresis for net -1L
   -if  extubatable, use IV nitro to prevent pulmonary flash edema.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 1.0, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT dwindling down w/ inc to 28 after 1 U
   PRBCs yesterday.   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large
   ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25 (t
fuse one unit today as above)
   - PO PPI daily
   - rpt PM Hct w/ Abd CT to assess for RP bleed if continues to decrease.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count increasing from nadir of 56. Now
   105.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient tachycardic overnight, but with recent
   bradycardia [**12-22**] beta blockers.
   - [**Month (only) 38**] dilt to 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA). EKG
   without ischemic changes and CE flat yesterday.
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -start diltiazem as above
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]
   - wound care consulted

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen.
- She presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient has been admitted multiple times and re-intubated due to failure to extubate.
- The current impression is that the hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, involving infectious, cardiac, and COPD factors.
- The patient has been started on steroids, antibiotics, and diuretics for management of these conditions.
- She also has acute renal failure, which is thought to be prerenal in origin and has improved with fluid resuscitation.
- The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed, with decreasing hemoglobin levels and a positive guaiac test on admission. No endoscopy is planned at this time.
- She has thrombocytopenia, which is increasing from a nadir of 56 to 105. PF4 antibodies are negative, and no heparin will be given due to her history of GI bleed.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with beta-blockers. Anticoagulation is not currently recommended due to the GI bleed.
- She has a history of coronary artery disease, including CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA), and her EKG is stable without"

   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid Pred 20 PO daily today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco finished /[**Last Name (un) **] day 8 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial

   - dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox x1 for diuresis today
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 0.9 today, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable today at 28.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping. DIC labs tomorrow am.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count once again trending down at 73
   today. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled
   - dilt 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. The patient presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient has had multiple episodes of reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely caused by a combination of factors such as infectious (pneumonia), cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia, and underlying congestive heart failure causing flash pulmonary edema), and COPD. The patient is currently on various medications including steroids, beta-agonists, antihypertensives, and antibiotics.

The patient also has acute renal failure, which is now improving, as well as thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 73,000/mm3. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, but it could be secondary to medications or another underlying condition.

Additionally, the patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, with no evidence of active bleeding but a positive guaiac test. The patient is being monitored closely, and further diagnostic tests may be ordered if the patient's hematocrit levels continue to drop.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently rate-controlled with diltiazem, and she"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. She was admitted for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated twice previously due to failure to extubate while admitted.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be multifactorial in nature, including infectious causes (pneumonia), cardiac issues (hypertension, tachycardia, and underlying congestive heart failure causing flash pulmonary edema), and COPD.

2. Pneumonia (Possible): Although sputum cultures showed no growth, the patient may still have a pneumonia contributing to her respiratory failure.

3. Cardiac Optimization: The patient requires improved blood pressure control, metabolic alkalosis management, and diuresis. She is currently on carvedilol and diltiazem.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable at 0.9. Consider starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) once extubated and hemodynamically stable.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by guaiac positive stool on admission."

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Continue steroids at 20 mg PO daily, taper tomorrow to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - completed 8 day course of Vancomycin and meropenem
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control. Metabolic alkalosis
   improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it earlier in
   the day.
   - cont Coreg to 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - dilt to 15 QID
   - additional dose of diamox today.
   Ventilation:
   - Repeat VBG with SBT today and extubation if passes SBT.
   - IV nitroglycerin during extubation to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   with removal of PPV.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping. DIC labs tomorrow am.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider anticoagulation.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled
   - dilt 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin tomorrow.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **].
   - Silvadene 1% cream to coccyx [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation. She had previous episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's current condition is stable, with improved blood pressure control and metabolic alkalosis. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been extubated twice but failed to wean off the ventilator successfully. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a back wound from a burn injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and previous episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a potential risk for recurring respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of guaiac positive stool on admission suggests active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function, which may require close monitoring and potentially dialysis if the condition worsens.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count raises concerns about bleeding risks,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Steroid Pred 20 PO daily today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - Vanco finished /[**Last Name (un) **] day 8 (of 8) for empiric coverate of nosomial
   pna
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization:
   -incr Coreg to 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - dilt to 15 QID
   -Diamox x1 for diuresis today
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 0.9 today, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable today at 28.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping. DIC labs tomorrow am.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count once again trending down at 73
   today. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled
   - dilt 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post CABG, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient had multiple episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure and was reintubated. She also has acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a burn wound on her back.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's repeated episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate difficulty in maintaining adequate ventilation and oxygenation. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's decrease in creatinine levels suggests improvement in renal function. However, close monitoring of renal parameters is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the patient's hematocrit levels are stable, the presence of guaiac positive stool indicates ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Active management is required to control the bleeding and maintain adequate blood volume.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. Monitoring platelet levels and considering transfusion if platelet count drops below 50 or in the presence of active bleeding is crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x2 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Likely multifactorial; both
   infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and
   underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -Continue steroids at 20 mg PO daily, taper tomorrow to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA:
   - completed 8 day course of Vancomycin and meropenem
   - sputum cx [**11-12**] no growth
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control. Metabolic alkalosis
   improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it earlier in
   the day.
   - cont Coreg to 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - dilt to 15 QID
   - additional dose of diamox today.
   - Repeat VBG with SBT today and extubation if passes SBT.
   - IV nitroglycerin during extubation to prevent flash pulmonary edema
   with removal of PPV.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Back to baseline Cr of 0.9 today, with good UOP.
   Thought to be [**12-22**] ATN.  No ACEI for now
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable today at 28.   No EGD only
   evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on admission. No scope
   indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding L upper leg.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping. DIC labs tomorrow am.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Unclear etiology.  Thought at outside hospital to be
   secondary to Zosyn.  Platelet count once again trending down at 73
   today. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - no heparin given hx of GI bleed
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled
   - dilt 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
   Will consider restarting next week if patient stable,
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - no ASA given GI bleed.
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension:
   - cont Coreg

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. She was admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation and presented from an outside hospital for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient had failed extubation twice while admitted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and required reintubation. Multifactorial causes such as infectious (pneumonia), cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia, and underlying congestive heart failure causing flash pulmonary edema), and COPD may contribute to her respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient had an incomplete 8-day course of Vancomycin and meropenem for suspected pneumonia. Although sputum culture showed no growth, the patient still has ongoing symptoms and signs of infection.
3. Cardiac Optimization: The patient's blood pressure needs to be controlled, and metabolic alkalosis improved with IV diamox. Additional doses of diamox were given today. Coreg was continued at 25 mg, and diltiazem was reduced to 15 mg QID.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had a previous episode of acute renal failure, but her creatinine"

   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -taper prednisone to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control on carvedilol. Metabolic
   alkalosis improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it
   earlier in the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID

    Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently

   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include infection,
   although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to failed extubation attempts. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 119/50 to 174/110 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) and has received fluids, blood products, and medications through it.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may recur if she is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has ongoing GI bleeding, as evidenced by guaiac positive stool and a decreasing hematocrit level. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage this condition.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post-coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. She was admitted from an outside hospital (OSH) for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has had multiple failed extubations, requiring reintubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy planned and do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and potential infectious causes may contribute to hypercarbic respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilation settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the patient has stable hemoglobin levels, there is evidence of GI bleeding as indicated by guaiac positive stool on admission. Active type and screen should be continued, and efforts should be made to identify and manage the source of bleeding.

   oxygen admitted from OSH for management of GI bleed, currently in
   hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring re-intubation yesterday.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Need to discuss restarting warfarin for AF (HCT been stable x3 days)
   - Patient was extubated and then had post-extubation ABG of 7.25/95/86,
   was then intubated once again.
   - Family discussion revealed that they feel patient would want to
   remain DNR/DNI; however, want to proceed with tracheostomy and PEG tube
   placement
   - Patient had cumulative fluid balance of -80 mL in 20 hours in the
   evening and thus further diuresis was not pursued
   - PM lytes and HCT were stable with slight decrease in sodium to 146
   and no change in creatinine follow diuresis during the day
   - AM CXR revealed that PICC line tip likely in azygous
   - Evening CXR showed that PICC line tip back in SVC following power

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -taper prednisone to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control on carvedilol. Metabolic
   alkalosis improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it
   earlier in the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - VBG shows appropriate ventilation. Continue current vent settings
   - NPO after MN for trach and PEG by IP in AM
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin tomorrow.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.

   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted from an outside hospital (OSH) for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to failure to extubate, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has a stable HCT and is not currently anticoagulated. The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely related to antibiotics, and has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is planned for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's repeated episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate difficulty in adequately ventilating and removing carbon dioxide from the blood. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent complications such as hypoxemia, increased intracranial pressure, and myocardial ischemia.

2. GI bleed: Although the patient has stable hemoglobin levels, the presence of guaiac positive stool suggests ongoing or recent GI bleeding. If not properly managed, this can lead to significant blood loss, hypotension, shock, and potentially death.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -stop steroids today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization:
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - Decrease vent settings to RR of 10 to correct alkalosis.
   - increase sedation, as agitated on the vent and ripping the skin on
   her hands.
   - to receive trach and PEG by IP today
   - start sedation wean (midaz to ativan or valium, fentanyl IV to patch)
   once trached.
   - start rehab screen
    Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics or PPI related. Stable in 70s.
   PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include
   infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - d/c PPI (can cause thrombocytopenia)
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - consider heme consult if platelets do not improve upon d/c of PPI.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   -cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who is currently admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has failed extubation three times and requires ongoing mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes a recent hospitalization for hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypertension, and a previous admission for flash pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to extubate and maintain adequate oxygenation suggests ongoing respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and management of ventilator settings, sedation, and weaning process are necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's stable creatinine levels indicate no acute deterioration, but close monitoring of renal function is required, especially considering the use of nephrotoxic medications and potential contrast exposure during procedures.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the patient's hematocrit has stabilized, there is evidence of oozing from the PICC site, and a large ecchymosis surrounding the left upper leg. Active type and screen should be initiated, and transfusion goals should be maintained above 25.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD
   on home oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while
   admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-22**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -taper prednisone to 10 mg PO daily
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization: Improved BP control on carvedilol. Metabolic
   alkalosis improved with IV diamox, and did have some diuresis with it
   earlier in the day.
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - VBG today shows appropriate ventilation (slightly alkalotic) .
   Continue current vent settings
   - NPO after MN for trach and PEG by IP in AM
    Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) if Hct remains
   stable.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
    .
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics related. Stable in 70s.  PF4
   antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include infection,
   although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
   Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   .
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   -cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   -cont dilt for now
   Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen presenting from outside hospital (OSH) for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate three times.

The patient has had multiple episodes of reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely multifactorial including infectious (pneumonia), cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia, and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary edema), and COPD. The patient's condition has been stabilized with improved blood pressure control on carvedilol, metabolic alkalosis improved with IV diamox, and some diuresis with it earlier in the day. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient also has acute renal failure with stable creatinine levels at 0.9, gastrointestinal bleed with stable hematocrit levels, thrombocytopenia with platelet count in the 70s, atrial fibrillation rate controlled with diltiazem, coronary artery disease s/p CABG, aortic valve replacement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a stage II ulcer on the back from a burn injury.

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Should attempt
   to wean from sedation today.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin. DIC labs
   negative. Patient had stable HCT for several days until drop this AM to
   24.9 in setting of ~200 mL coffee ground liquid output from new PEG
   tube. Received 1 U PRBC following discovery of coffee ground output. No
   other evidence of active bleeding. PPI had been discontinued [**2154-11-20**]
   due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restart PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possible antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued yesterday for
   this reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential
   GI bleed. Platelets are up to 122 today following platelet transfusion
   yesterday. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   Improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to 150s-160s.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on 11/20/2154. She also has a large ecchymosis surrounding her groin, which is not consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's platelet count has improved to 122 K/uL following a platelet transfusion yesterday. Her hemoglobin concentration dropped from 26.3 to 24.9 after experiencing bleeding around the tracheostomy and PEG sites. She received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to the bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is still on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including infectious causes (pneumonia), cardiac causes (hypertension, tachycardia, and underlying congestive heart failure causing flash pulmonary edema), and COPD. She has had multiple episodes of intubation and extubation.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had stable hematocrit levels until this morning when there was a"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-23**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -stop steroids today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization:
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID\
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - Decrease vent settings to RR of 10 to correct alkalosis.
   - increase sedation, as agitated on the vent and ripping the skin on
   her hands.
   - to receive trach and PEG by IP today
   - start sedation wean (midaz to ativan or valium, fentanyl IV to patch)
   once trached.
   - start rehab screen
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics or PPI related. Stable in 70s.
   PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include
   infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - d/c PPI (can cause thrombocytopenia)
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - consider heme consult if platelets do not improve upon d/c of PPI.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
    Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   - cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - cont dilt for now
    Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several procedures, including percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She also has thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by the presence of maroon coffee grounds in the PEG tube drainage and a decrease in hematocrit levels. Further evaluation and management are required to control the bleeding.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to COPD exacerbation. Continuous monitoring and optimization of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is currently being managed with rate control medications. Anticoagulation therapy may be considered after the procedures and once platelet counts recover.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, possibly due to antibiotics or PPI use. Close monitoring of platelet levels and appropriate management, including transfusion for platelets below 50,000/mm3 or active bleeding, are recommended.

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but
   re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then
   extubated [**11-11**], put on intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated [**12-23**] AMS
   and hypercarbic resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**],
   patient became progressively hypercarbic and required intubation.
   Likely multifactorial; both infectious (pneumonia) and cardiac
   (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF causing flash pulmonary
   edema) as well as COPD.
   For COPD:
   -stop steroids today
   -continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   For PNA: No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no fevers.
   Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   For Cardiac optimization:
   - cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **]
   - diltiazem to 15 QID\
   - runs even today
   Ventilation:
   - Decrease vent settings to RR of 10 to correct alkalosis.
   - increase sedation, as agitated on the vent and ripping the skin on
   her hands.
   - to receive trach and PEG by IP today
   - start sedation wean (midaz to ativan or valium, fentanyl IV to patch)
   once trached.
   - start rehab screen
   Acute Renal Failure: Cre stable at 0.9. Consider starting ACEI once
   extubated and hemodynamically stable.
   Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable at 28 x3 days.   Hct down to 26,
   stable on rpt, likely due to some oozing from PICC site repositioning.
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. No scope indicated per GI. Also has large ecchymosis
   surrounding L upper leg. DIC labs negative.
   - active type and screen
   - PICC access currently
   - transfusion goal > 25
   - PO PPI daily
   - monitoring hematoma. Low threshold to CT for RP bleed if HCT keeps
   dropping.
   - consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   - check B12, folate iron studies
   Thrombocytopenia:  Possible antibiotics or PPI related. Stable in 70s.
   PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include
   infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - daily PLT check
   - d/c PPI (can cause thrombocytopenia)
   - transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - consider heme consult if platelets do not improve upon d/c of PPI.
   Atrial Fibrillation:  Currently rate controlled  and hemodynamically
   stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed, but has been
   stable in Hct x3 days.
   - diltiazem 15 [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider restarting coumadin after procedures.
   - holding tykosin and digoxin
    Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - continue simvastatin
   - switched metoprolol to coreg [**11-13**] after bradycardia and hypotension
   [**11-12**].
   - consider restarting ASA
   Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic): Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   Hypertension: improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to
   150s-160s.
   - cont Coreg at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - cont dilt for now
    Hyperlipidemia:
   - simvastatin
   Back Wound:  Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and aortic valve replacement. She presented to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has had multiple failed extubation attempts and requires ongoing mechanical ventilation. She also has impaired skin integrity, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and organ failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, specifically hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can result in hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, and further deterioration of organ function.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infection and potential wound complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if the platelet count continues to decrease or if there are any additional bleeding events.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, further complications, and decreased organ function.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can result in hemodynamic instability, thromboemb"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, which indicates the severity of their condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation. The patient's temperature is within normal limits at 36.4°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of pain. The tracheostomy tube is in place, and the endotracheal tube has been removed. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or irregular heart rhythms detected. The respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with no wheezes or crackles.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 122 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 67. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history is significant for failed extubation three times, resulting in respiratory failure. They also have anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and a groin hematoma, all of which are being closely monitored. The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp failure (failed extubation X 3)
 s/p Trach.  Monitor.  Hope to
   continue work towards weaning from mechanical ventilation.  Obstacles
   include underlying COPD and CAD (suspect component of cardiac
   ischemia).
   COPD
 continue to optimized medical regimen.  D/C steroids.
   ANEMIA
 Continues gradual decline.  Suspect related recent groin
   hematoma, and now predominately to phlebotomy.  Monitor for eivdence of
   GI bleed.
   GI BLEED
 coffee grounds most likely related to PEG yeasterday, but
   need to monitor (as GI bleed was initial problem at time of transfer to
   [**Hospital1 54**]).
   GROIN HEMATOMA
 stable.  Monitor exam.
   CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA -- a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses.  Sensitive to
   pharmacological agents?  Consider Cardiology consult to assist in
   mangement.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 contribution from zosyn?; HIT neg.  Monitor plts

They have undergone several interventions including percutaneous tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. The patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy and tolerated these procedures well.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 142/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has atrial flutter with a regular rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal heart sounds. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, with no crackles or wheezes. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show trace edema, and there are no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and normal tone.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 122 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 67 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Should attempt
   to wean from sedation today.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin. DIC labs
   negative. Patient had stable HCT for several days until drop this AM to
   24.9 in setting of ~200 mL coffee ground liquid output from new PEG
   tube. Received 1 U PRBC following discovery of coffee ground output. No
   other evidence of active bleeding. PPI had been discontinued [**2154-11-20**]
   due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restart PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possible antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued yesterday for
   this reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential
   GI bleed. Platelets are up to 122 today following platelet transfusion
   yesterday. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   Improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to 150s-160s.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Ongoing attempt
   to wean from sedation today while managing her agitation and confusion.
   Decrease in FiO2 requirement yesterday to 35%.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD this admission. Only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin and
   extending up left flank. DIC labs negative. Patient had stable HCT for
   several days until drop [**2154-11-21**] AM to 24.9 in setting of ~200 mL
   coffee ground liquid output from new PEG tube. Received 1 U PRBC
   following discovery of coffee ground output and evening HCT check was
   28.4 on [**2154-11-21**]. This AM HCT was 27.0. No evidence of profuse active
   bleeding at this time as residuals on tube feeds without blood. Some
   slight oozing around peg tube site yesterday. PPI had been discontinued
   [**2154-11-20**] due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia,
   but was restarted on [**2154-11-21**].
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Continue PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possibly a medication effect due to antibiotics or PPI. PPI was
   discontinued [**2154-11-20**] for this reason; however, had to be restarted
   [**2154-11-21**] in setting of potential GI bleed with coffee ground appearing
   output from g-tube. Platelets up to 122 [**2154-11-21**] following platelet
   transfusion on [**2154-11-20**]. PF4 antibodies negative this admission.
   Other etiologies include infection, although appears to be recovering
   from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   With weaning of sedation, patient had systolic hypertension to the
   180s. Will need tighter control.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Can consider restarting home enalapril 10 mg daily
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on 11/20/2154. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including infectious, cardiac, and COPD-related causes. She has been extubated multiple times but requires reintubation due to progressive hypercarbia. Her current medications include carvedilol, diltiazem, Advair, ipratropium, and home xopenex. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, possibly related to medication effects, and is currently not anticoagulated after a GI bleed prior to presentation. She has a history of coronary artery disease, including CABG (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery), and bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. The patient's hypertension needs tighter control, and she has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including infectious, cardiac, and COPD-related causes. She requires close monitoring and ongoing ventilation support.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has evidence of GI bleeding, which could be due to various causes such as peptic ulcer disease, diverticulosis, or esophageal varices. She requires careful management of her PEG tube, and her blood products need to be closely monitored.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, possibly related to medication effects, particularly antibiotics and PPI. Platelet transfusion may be necessary if her platelet count drops below 50,000 or if there is active bleeding.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled with diltiazem. Anticoagulation may be considered once platelets stabilize and there is no evidence of ongoing GI bleed.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, including CABG and bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. Her cardiac status needs to be monitored closely.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that needs tighter control, especially as she is being weaned off sedation.
7. Back Wound: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury. Wound care is important, and the patient may require dressings as per recommendations.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessments and management."

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on

   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Ongoing attempt
   to wean from sedation today while managing her agitation and confusion
   with PRNs of benzos as zyprexa seemed to have little impact yesterday
   evening
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD this admission. Only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive
   stool on admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin and
   extending up left flank. DIC labs negative. Patient had stable HCT for
   several days until drop [**2154-11-21**] AM to 24.9 in setting of ~200 mL
   coffee ground liquid output from new PEG tube. Received 1 U PRBC
   following discovery of coffee ground output and evening HCT check was
   28.4 on [**2154-11-21**]. This AM HCT was 27.0. No evidence of profuse active
   bleeding at this time as residuals on tube feeds without blood. Some
   slight oozing around peg tube site yesterday. PPI had been discontinued
   [**2154-11-20**] due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia,
   but was restarted on [**2154-11-21**]. This AM on rounds report of large volume
   vomitus tinged with blood.
   - Hold tube feeds until etiology of blood in vomitus is determined
   - Consult GI for EGD to assess for UGI bleed
   - Follow PM HCT today
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal HCT > 25
   - Continue PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possibly a medication effect due to antibiotics or PPI. PPI was
   discontinued [**2154-11-20**] for this reason; however, had to be restarted
   [**2154-11-21**] in setting of potential GI bleed with coffee ground appearing
   output from g-tube. Platelets up to 122 [**2154-11-21**] following platelet
   transfusion on [**2154-11-20**]. Then platelets fell slightly to 94 this AM.
   PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies include
   infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated due to thrombocytopenia and history of GI bleed.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Continue carvedilol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN.
   # Hypertension:
   With weaning of sedation, patient had systolic hypertension to the
   180s. Will need tighter control.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Can consider restarting home enalapril 10 mg daily
   - Hold carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 TID for now while working up
   GI bleeding
   - Consider metoprolol IV and hydral IV PRN while tube use on hold in
   setting of potential GI bleed.
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for management of GI bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several extubations and reintubations due to her respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial and includes infectious, cardiac, and COPD-related causes. She has also had a tracheostomy and PEG placement.

The patient's current medical conditions include PNA (pneumonia), cardiac optimization, COPD, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and atrial fibrillation. The gastrointestinal bleeding is evidenced by coffee ground liquid output from the PEG tube and guaiac positive stool. The thrombocytopenia may be due to medication effects or infection. The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently rate-controlled with diltiazem but is not anticoagulated due to thrombocytopenia and history of GI bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial and includes infectious, cardiac, and COPD-related causes. It is important to continue optimizing cardiac status, managing COPD, and addressing any infectious causes.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has evidence of GI bleed, including coffee ground liquid output from the PEG tube and guaiac positive stool. It is"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   At OSH was extubated [**2154-11-5**], but re-intubated [**11-10**] at [**Hospital1 54**] for
   hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then extubated [**11-11**], put on
   intermittent bipap o/n and reintubated secondary to AMS and hypercarbic
   resp failure [**11-12**].  Attempted extubation on [**11-18**], patient became
   progressively hypercarbic and required intubation once again. Her
   respiratory failure is likely multifactorial; both infectious
   (pneumonia) and cardiac (hypertension, tachycardia and underlying CHF
   causing flash pulmonary edema) as well as COPD. Is s/p tracheostomy and
   PEG on [**2154-11-20**].
   1)       PNA:  No evidence of growth, leukocytosis resolving, no
   fevers. Compled 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem.
   2)       Cardiac optimization: Cont carvedilol 25  [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 15 mg
   TID, I/O goal of even today
   3)       COPD: Steroids discontinued [**2154-11-20**]. Continue advair,
   ipratropium, home xopenex.
   4)       Ventilation: Doing well with new tracheostomy. Should attempt
   to wean from sedation today.
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
   No EGD only evidence for GI bleed is guaiac positive stool on
   admission. Also has large ecchymosis surrounding groin. DIC labs
   negative. Patient had stable HCT for several days until drop this AM to
   24.9 in setting of ~200 mL coffee ground liquid output from new PEG
   tube. Received 1 U PRBC following discovery of coffee ground output. No
   other evidence of active bleeding. PPI had been discontinued [**2154-11-20**]
   due to concern that it was contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restart PPI
   - Consider restarting anticoagulatins (ASA, coumadin) after trach and
   if platelets improve.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   Possible antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued yesterday for
   this reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential
   GI bleed. Platelets are up to 122 today following platelet transfusion
   yesterday. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently rate controlled when comfortable with pain and anxiety
   control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable. Currently not
   anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem 15 TID
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):
   Not anticoagulated.  Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe
   pulm regurg and mild pulm HTN
   # Hypertension:
   Improved control (SBPs in 130s) with transient SBPs to 150s-160s.
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue carvedilol at 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue diltiazem 15 TID for now
   #Back Wound:
   Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at [**Location (un) **]. Wound
   care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped steroids (can
   contribute to skin thinning).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure, requiring intubation and tracheostomy. She also has a history of pneumonia, for which she completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and meropenem. Her cardiac status is optimized with carvedilol and diltiazem. 

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is evidenced by guaiac positive stool and coffee ground output from the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Her hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 28.5 to 24.9 following the bleeding episode. 

Thrombocytopenia is present, with a platelet count of 70, but it has improved to 122 after a platelet transfusion. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, currently being rate-controlled with diltiazem. She is not anticoagulated due to the recent gastrointestinal bleed. 

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, for which she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery. She also had aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve. 

Hypertension is partially controlled with carvedilol and diltiazem. 

The patient has a large ecchymosis surrounding the groin area, but disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) labs are negative. 

The patient has a history of COPD, for which she is on home oxygen. 

The patient's back wound is a stage II ulcer from a burn injury. 

In the ICU, the patient is receiving tube feeds through a PEG tube. Her glycemic control is being monitored. She has a PICC line in place for medication administration. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis."

   Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, failure to extubate
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had some blood-tinged vomit yesterday .  Her Hct remained
   stable at 27.0 in the am and 29.4 in the afternoon.  GI was contact[**Name (NI) **],
   but did not feel that the bleeding was an acute issue and did not want
   to scope her this hospitalization unless it worsened.  IP was told
   about his and offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want
   this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't
   think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind.
   - Her tube feeds have been held given the bleeding and her meds were
   changed to IV.
   - CXR showed improving left retrocardiac opacity (thought to reflects a
   combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis); no evidence of
   aspiration.
   - Patient had elevated SBP's.  Was given an additional 5 mg IV
   metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however her SBPs remained in
   the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given 10 mg IV hydralazine
   and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
 changed to IV
   yesterday
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restarted PPI yesterday
 with close monitoring of plt count
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Diltiazem changed to IV, BB changed to IV
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Switched metoprolol to carvedilol [**11-13**] after bradycardia and
   hypotension [**11-12**].
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Patient had elevated SBP's overnight  Was given an
   additional 5 mg IV metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however
   her SBPs remained in the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given
   10 mg IV hydralazine and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.
   BP
s now in 120
s-130
   - Will monitor closely as we liberate from sedation and narcotics
   - Continue IV CBB and BB for now with prn hydralazine
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. She presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure, with a failure to extubate three times while admitted.

The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin/meropenem. Her cardiac status is being optimized with a beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker (CCB) changed to IV yesterday. She is also receiving Advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, and steroids, which were discontinued on the 20th. 

The patient has stable hemoglobin (Hct) in the high 20s. A gastrointestinal consult was obtained, who agreed that the bleeding was not an acute issue and an emergent scope is not indicated unless the GI bleed worsens. The patient's family is okay with her getting a scope if the GI consult changes their mind.

The patient's platelet count is stable in the 90-100 range. Unclear causes include antibiotics or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) related, as the PPI was discontinued due to thrombocytopenia but had to be restarted today in the setting of potential GI bleed. The patient received a platelet transfusion two days ago"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing hypoxia and failure to extubate. They had blood-tinged vomit yesterday, with stable hematocrit levels. There were no acute issues identified by GI, and they did not recommend a scope during this hospitalization unless the bleeding worsens. The patient's tube feeds have been held, and medications have been changed to IV.

The patient's chest X-ray showed improving left retrocardiac opacity, which is thought to reflect a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, with no evidence of aspiration. The patient had elevated systolic blood pressures, and additional medications were given to lower them.

The patient's allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, review of systems, flow sheet data, respiratory support, physical examination, and labs/radiology results are all documented in the note.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's diminished breath sounds at the bases and rhonchorous breath sounds throughout may indicate aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Bleeding: The blood-tinged vomit and the lack of acute issues identified by GI suggest ongoing bleeding, which needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), indicates difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation, which can have serious implications.

 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
 changed to IV
   yesterday
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restarted PPI yesterday
 with close monitoring of plt count
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Patient had elevated SBP's overnight  Was given an
   additional 5 mg IV metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however
   her SBPs remained in the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given
   10 mg IV hydralazine and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.
   BP
s now in 120
s-130
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   - changed to po meds as above with prn hydralazine, titrate up as
   necessary
   #Agitation:   Was agitatioed last night at time of increaed bp
   recevied haldol with good effect
   -haldol prn for night time agitation
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

 screening for respiratory rehab
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure, with previous failed extubation attempts.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has blood-tinged vomit yesterday, but her hematocrit (Hct) remains stable. It is important to maintain close monitoring of the platelet count, and a type and screen should be kept active. Transfusion goal should be maintained above 25. The patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC).

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable in the range of 90-100 thousand/mm^3. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, but possibilities include antibiotics or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) related effects. PPI was discontinued due to thrombocytopenia, but had to be restarted today in the setting of potential GI bleed. The patient received a platelet transfusion two days ago, which increased her platelet count from 65 to 122 thousand/mm^3. PF"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient is currently mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy due to respiratory failure and has a history of failed extubation attempts. The patient has episodes of hypertension that require adjustment of antihypertensive medications. The patient also experienced coffee ground emesis, which has resolved, and a positive guaiac stool test, indicating potential gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has anemia, suspected to be related to recent groin hematoma and phlebotomy. There are concerns for ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient's hypertension needs to be managed. The patient has a skin burn on their back, which requires local care, as well as a stable groin hematoma. The patient is also experiencing cardiac dysrhythmia, including atrial flutter, bradycardia, and sinus pauses, and may require a cardiology consult for management. The patient has thrombocytopenia, possibly related to antibiotics, and is being monitored for platelet count. Nutritional support will be resumed via a new percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status and is currently in the ICU."

   RESPRIATORY FAILURE (failed extubation X 3)
 s/p Trach.  Hope to
   continue work towards weaning from mechanical ventilation.  Obstacles
   include underlying COPD and CAD (suspect component of cardiac
   ischemia).  Monitor progress, work towards trach collar trials.  Rehab
   screening in progress.
   COPD
 continue to optimized medical regimen.  D/C steroids.
   ANEMIA
 Suspect related recent groin hematoma, and now predominately
   to phlebotomy.  Last PRBC transfusion [**2154-11-21**].  Monitor for eivdence of
   GI bleed.  Currently stable.
   GI BLEED
 coffee grounds possibly related to PEG, now resolved.  Need
   to monitor closely for GI bleed, as GI bleed was initial problem at
   time of transfer to [**Hospital1 54**].
   HYPTERTENSION -- resume and adjust PO meds.
   SKIN BURN, BACK -- local care.
   GROIN HEMATOMA
 stable.  Monitor exam.
   CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA -- a-fib/bradycardia/sinus pauses.  Sensitive to
   pharmacological agents.  Consider Cardiology consult to assist in
   mangement.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 contribution from antibiotics (zosyn?); HIT neg.
   Monitor plts count.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 resume TF via new PEG.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy due to respiratory failure. The patient has experienced multiple episodes of hypertension and required adjustment of antihypertensive medications. There was also an episode of coffee ground emesis, which has resolved. The patient's stool was positive for guaiac, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is awake and interactive but has been experiencing some agitation, which responded to haloperidol.

The patient has a history of COPD and cardiac artery disease (CAD), and there are concerns about cardiac ischemia. The patient's anemia is suspected to be related to recent groin hematoma and phlebotomy. Blood transfusion was given on [**2154-11-21**]. The patient's skin burn on the back requires local care. The patient's groin hematoma is stable, and cardiac dysrhythmia, specifically atrial flutter with bradycardia and sinus pauses, is present.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to antibiotics (zosyn?); however, the patient is negative for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). The patient's nutritional support will be resumed via a new percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation"

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes: Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**] this
   morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be septic
   physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded to fluid
   boluses.  Other potential etiologies include hypoperfusion/ischemia,
   intracranial hemorrhage or CVA.
   - stat Head CT
   - hold antihypertensives until more stable
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Had been hypertensive requring IV Hydralazine.
   - hold antihypertensives while hypotensive; reintroduce medications
   slowly
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   #Agitation:   Previously managed well on PRN Haldol
   -haldol prn for night time agitation
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p CABG and AVR, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She presented to the ICU with management of GI bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated multiple times but failed to wean off the ventilator successfully.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hypotension/MS changes: The patient had an episode of mental status changes associated with hypotension. Other potential etiologies include hypoperfusion/ischemia, intracranial hemorrhage, or CVA. A stat head CT was ordered to investigate further.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously extubated but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has completed an 8-day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem. The plan is to optimize cardiac status with a beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker. She will continue to receive Advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, and steroids which were discontinued on 11/20.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had blood-tinged vomit yesterday, and her HCT was stable in the high 20s. A GI consultation obtained agreed that bleeding was not an acute issue, and an emergent scope is not indicated unless GI bleeding worsens. The patient has received a total of 4 units of packed red"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post CABG and AVR, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient has been intubated multiple times due to failure to extubate and has undergone a tracheostomy. She has completed an 8-day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem antibiotics. Her cardiac status is being optimized with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. 

The patient experienced blood-tinged vomit yesterday, and her hematocrit (Hct) was stable in the high 20s. A gastrointestinal (GI) scope is planned if her bleeding worsens. She has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). 

Her platelet count is stable in the range of 90-100,000/mm3, but the cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear. Possible causes include antibiotics or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) related, as PPI was discontinued due to thrombocytopenia but had to be restarted due to potential GI bleed. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation that is currently rate-controlled with pain and anxiety management. She is not anticoagulated after a prior GI bleed. 

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease post CAB"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
 changed to IV
   yesterday
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - Restarted PPI yesterday
 with close monitoring of plt count
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Patient had elevated SBP's overnight  Was given an
   additional 5 mg IV metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however
   her SBPs remained in the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given
   10 mg IV hydralazine and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.
   BP

 screening for respiratory rehab
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial flutter (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has had multiple extubation attempts due to failure to wean off mechanical ventilation. This could be multifactorial, involving factors such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure/flash pulmonary edema, and underlying COPD.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presented with blood-tinged vomit, and her hemoglobin concentration was stable in the high 20s. A gastrointestinal (GI) consultation was obtained, and it was determined that the bleeding was not an acute issue, so an emergent endoscopy was not necessary. However, the possibility of GI bleeding may still exist, and monitoring with guaiac testing of stools is recommended.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been stable in the range of 90-100 thousand/mm3. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, but potential causes include antibiotics or proton pump inhibitor (P"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, both acute and chronic. The patient remains mechanically ventilated via tracheotomy tube in IPS mode with PEEP set at 5. The patient experienced nausea and vomiting with the initiation of tube feeds and had a reduction in urine output that responded to an intravenous fluid bolus. During rounds, the patient had an abrupt reduction in mental status and was somnolent, difficult to arouse, and moving all four extremities purposefully in response to painful stimuli. This occurred in the context of relative hypotension with a systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. There was no significant improvement with resolving hypotension using intravenous fluid bolus. The patient's finger stick glucose level was within normal limits, and oxygen saturation was within normal range.

Medical History:
The patient has a medical history of COPD, CAD, and altered mental status. The patient has undergone a tracheotomy and is being weaned from mechanical ventilation. The patient is also receiving nutrition through tube feeds, which were held due to nausea and vomiting. The patient has experienced episodes of diarrhea, abdominal distention, and anemia. Additionally, the patient has had a groin hematoma, skin burn on the back, cardiac dysrhythmia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient also requires nutritional support.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes respiratory failure, COPD, altered mental"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been mechanically ventilated via tracheotomy tube due to failed extubation attempts. There is an ongoing effort to wean the patient from mechanical ventilation, but obstacles such as underlying COPD and CAD may hinder progress.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to medication effects or CO2 retention. A head CT is planned to assess for intracranial bleed, as concern for a new neurological event is present.

3. Abdominal Distention: The patient has evidence of air in the stomach and bowel, which raises the possibility of ileus. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube to gravity or suction is planned to decompress the abdomen.

4. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, and stool culture for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is necessary to check for infection.

5. Anemia: The patient is anemic, and it is suspected to be related to recent groin hematoma and phlebotomy. Monitoring for evidence of GI bleed is important, as GI bleed was initially encountered during transfer to the hospital.

6. GI Bleed: The patient had a coffee grounds-type GI bleed, possibly related to PEG, which has now resolved. However, close monitoring for GI"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes: Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**] yesterday
   morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be septic
   physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded to fluid
   boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.
   - will given higher hold parameters for her antihypertensives
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Patient vomited yesterday, but no blood
   in the vomit.  Hct was stable at 30.8.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded
   that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated
   inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG
   site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen
   and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok
   with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a
   total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 61 from 81 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued
   for this reason; however, had to be restarted in setting of potential
   GI bleed. PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although she has been afebrile without clinical
   evidence of infection.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po dilt and carvedilol as her BP tolerates
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed.
   # Hypertension: Had been hypotensive yesterday in the am, so her
   medications were held.  This am she has SBP in the 180
s so her regular
   am meds were given.
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates.
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

 screening for respiratory rehab
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She presented to the hospital for management of a gastrointestinal bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted multiple times and has undergone several interventions.

Key points from the progress note include:

1. Hypotension/MS changes: The patient had an episode of mental status changes associated with hypotension. A head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology. The patient responded to fluid boluses, and antihypertensive medications were held. The patient's mental status is being closely monitored.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously extubated but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This is likely multifactorial, involving post-nasal drip, congestive heart failure/flash pulmonary edema, and underlying COPD. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient vomited yesterday, but no blood was present in the vomit. Her hematocrit (Hct) level remains stable at 30.8. A gastrointestinal (GI) consultation was obtained, and it was agreed that the bleeding was not an acute issue. An emergent endoscopy is not indicated unless the GI bleeding worsens. The patient has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for management of GI bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She had previously failed extubation attempts twice and required reintubation. The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin/meropenem. She is s/p trach and PEG and has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury.

During her stay, the patient experienced hypotension associated with MS changes but responded to fluid boluses. A head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology. She also had a vomiting episode without blood in the vomit, and her Hct was stable at 30.8. A GIU c/s agreed that bleeding was not an acute issue, and an emergent scope was not indicated unless GI bleeding worsened.

The patient's platelet count decreased to 61 from 81, with previous platelet counts ranging from 61 to 122. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, with possibilities including antibiotics or PPI-related effects. The PPI was discontinued due to thrombocytopenia but had to be restarted in the setting of potential GI bleed.

The patient has been on high doses of antihypertensive medications, which were temporarily held due to hypotension. Her blood pressure is now controlled with dilt"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes: Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**] this
   morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be septic
   physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded to fluid
   boluses.  Other potential etiologies include hypoperfusion/ischemia,
   intracranial hemorrhage or CVA.
   - stat Head CT
   - hold antihypertensives until more stable
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach ane PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimiazing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Has blood tinged vomit yesterday.  Hct
   was stable in high 20
s.  GIU c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding
   was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB
   worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable in 90-100
s.  Unclear cause. Possibiilties
   include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued for this
   reason; however, had to be restarted today in setting of potential GI
   bleed. Patient received plt transfusion 2 days ago with bump to 122
   from 65/  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other etiologies
   include infection, although appears to be recovering from PNA.
   - Daily PLT check
   - Transfuse for platelets < 50 or active bleeding
   - Consider restarting anticoagulation for AF once procedures over and
   platelets recover.
   - Consider heme consult if platelets continue to downtrend
   - Restart tube feeds with predosing of Zofran from nausea
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Will need scope if bleeds with tube feeds
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - will change back to po dilt and carvediolol with tube feeds, titrate
   up as necessary
   - Consider restarting coumadin once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   - Holding tykosin and digoxin
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Restarted carvediolol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN
   # Hypertension: Had been hypertensive requring IV Hydralazine.
   - hold antihypertensives while hypotensive; reintroduce medications
   slowly
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   #Agitation:   Previously managed well on PRN Haldol
   -haldol prn for night time agitation
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

 screening for respiratory rehab
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypotension/MS changes: The patient had an episode of MS changes this morning associated with hypotension. Other potential etiologies include hypoperfusion/ischemia, intracranial hemorrhage or CVA. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of these symptoms.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient was extubated but later reintubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This could be multifactorial, including post-nasal airway obstruction (PNA), congestive heart failure (CHF)/flash pulmonary edema, and underlying COPD. It is important to optimize cardiac status with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, continue respiratory support, and consider other contributing factors.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has blood-tinged vomit, and Hct was stable in the high 20s. A GI scope was not performed emergently, as the bleeding was not considered acute. However, the family is open to a scope"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on November 20th. She has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and meropenem. The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, with the lowest level of 61. She received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC). Her blood pressure has been difficult to control, and her antihypertensive medications were held due to high readings. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently anticoagulated. She also has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) and saphenous vein graft (SVG) to right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is also hypertensive and has a history of a back wound with a stage II ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension. This could be due to various factors, including septic physiology, medication side effects, or underlying medical"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - TF were restarted, however she had some nausea and abominal
   fullness.  She was also started on reglan.  Given simethicone and
   zofran with decrease in her nausea so she was restarted on tube feeds
   again.
   - Heme-onc evaluated her for her persistent thrombocytopenia and
   recommended resending HIT Ab test and thought her thromboyctopenia may
   have been drug related as it appears she has had it to the 60's as long
   ago as [**2147**].  Their most likely candidates included simvastatin and
   diltiazem.  Simvastatin was stopped.
   - Her holding parameters were increased for her BP meds given her
   hypotension yesterday.
   - She was 1 L positive and her SBP's were elevated in the 170's so she
   was given 10 mg IV lasix (goal of 500 cc neg).
   - Had SBPs in the 180's overnight, asymptomatic.  Was given 10 mg of po
   hydralazine.  Her SBP went to the 200's shortly after and she was given
   10 mg of IV hydralazine with improvement of her pressures back to the
   180s and then later to the 140s.  Also changed her po dilt to 15 mg po

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and was initially managed in the ICU. The patient has undergone several medical interventions including cardiac catheterization with CABG and AVR, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and has a history of thrombocytopenia.

The patient's recent events include restarting tube feeds after experiencing nausea and abdominal fullness, which were managed with antacids and antiemetics. She also had an episode of hypotension with altered mental status, but responded to fluid resuscitation and did not show any signs of sepsis. The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, with a current value of 61,000/mm3, and she received a transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells.

The patient's current medical issues include hypertension, hypercarbic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and a history of back wound infection. She is currently receiving various medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include further deterioration of respiratory status, worsening of gastrointestinal bleeding,"

   # Hypotension/MS changes:Improving. Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**]
   2 days ago morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be
   septic physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded
   to fluid boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.
   Sommnolent this morning, but arousable, appeared very drowsy, got 1mg
   ativan at midnight likely causing this.
   - will give higher hold parameters for her antihypertensives
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - d/c ativan as not good medication in eldery
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely

   - SBT today with goal to come off vent onto trach mask
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >24 hours.  Hct was stable
   at 31.6.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding was not an acute
   issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP
   offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want this (however
   this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't think the
   blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her getting a scope
   if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 57 from 61 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued
   for this reason; however, had to be restarted in setting of potential
   GI bleed. [**Month (only) 60**] have also been secondary to zosyn, however this was
   stopped days ago.  PF4 antibodies negative this admission. Other
   etiologies include infection, although she has been afebrile without
   clinical evidence of infection, or consumption.  Per heme onc recs,
   likely chronic in nature, as far back at [**2151**].  Probably drug related,

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. She presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure, with repeated attempts at extubation while admitted. The patient has a complex medical history and is currently critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and pulmonary hypertension may contribute to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and close management are required.
2. GI Bleeding: The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, and conservative management is ongoing. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and continued transfusion goal of >25% are necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, and a platelet count of <20k warrants consideration for transfusion.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation is being held due to the recent gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient had a previous CABG and is currently on carvedilol. Aspirin is being held for the GI bleed.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and carvedilol dosage may need adjustment.
7. Potential infections: The patient's"

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes:Improving. Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**]
   2 days ago morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be
   septic physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded
   to fluid boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.
   Sommnolent this morning, but arousable, appeared very drowsy, got 1mg
   ativan at midnight likely causing this.
   - will give higher hold parameters for her antihypertensives
   - continue to monitor mental status
   - d/c ativan as not good medication in eldery
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely

 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimizing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - Will aim for 500 cc negative today, was (+) 1.5 L yesterday, CXR
   looks volume overloaded
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   - SBT today with goal to come off vent onto trach mask
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >24 hours.  Hct was stable
   at 31.6.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding was not an acute
   issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP
   offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want this (however
   this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't think the
   blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her getting a scope
   if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets decreased today to 57 from 61 (have
   been as low as 61 previously during this hospitalization and most
   recently as high as 122 after a plt transfusion.  Unclear cause.
   Possibiilties include antibiotics or PPI related. PPI was discontinued

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial flutter, COPD, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She presented from another hospital for management of GI bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for approximately one month.

The patient's current condition includes hypertension, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoxia. She has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement.

The patient's medical team is closely monitoring her vital signs, hemodynamic status, fluid balance, and respiratory support. She is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, and she has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells.

The patient's medication regimen includes carvedilol, diltiazem, pantoprazole, and lisinopril. Her antihypertensive medications have been adjusted to avoid hypotension. The patient is also on prophylactic antibiotics and has had a PICC line placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased to 57 from 61, indicating a potential risk of bleeding. This could be due to various factors such as antibiotics, PPIs, infection, or consumption.
2. Hypertension: The patient"

   issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP
   offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want this (however
   this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't think the
   blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her getting a scope

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 while admitted.
   # Hypotension/MS changes:Ipt
s mental status has greatly improved
   following the d/c of Ativan. Pt is alert and able to communicate with
   hand signals on how she is feeling. Pt had episode of MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7331**]
   2 days ago morning associated with hypotension.  Does not appear to be
   septic physiology without fevers or positive culture data.  Responded
   to fluid boluses.  Head CT showed no acute intracranial pathology.
   - continue to monitor mental status
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - optimizing cardiac status with betablocker and CCB
   - Will aim for even I/Os today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   - Will trial trachea mask today
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >48 hours.  Hct was stable
   at 30.9.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that bleeding was not an acute
   issue and emergent scope not indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP
   offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want this (however
   this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't think the
   blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her getting a scope
   if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   48 from 57 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**], discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy regarding
   the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear currently pending.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive as high as 205 overnight, responded well
   to IV hydralizine.  SBP
s this morning in 140
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - carvedilol currently at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], will consider increasing to 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if she continues to be hypertensive
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- She presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), hypoxia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.
- She was initially extubated but required reintubation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient's mental status has improved since discontinuing Ativan.
- She has a history of hypertension, which is currently being managed with medications.
- The patient has thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts decreasing from 57 to 48.
- A bone marrow biopsy is planned to investigate the cause of thrombocytopenia.
- The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled.
- She has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement.
- The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back from a burn injury.
- Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 140/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 35%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presented with GIB, and it is crucial to monitor for any signs of rebleeding or worsening of the condition.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may require ongoing management and monitoring to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, indicating potential bleeding risks. Close monitoring and appropriate management, including transfusion when necessary, are important.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be carefully managed to prevent complications related to uncontrolled hypertension.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm should be closely monitored, and anticoagulation may need to be restarted after the bone marrow biopsy.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of CAD and recent CABG surgery make her susceptible to cardiac complications such as myocardial ischemia or infarction.
7. Back Wound: The patient has a stage II ulcer on her back, which requires regular wound care to prevent infection or worsening of the wound.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypertension. He presented to the hospital with respiratory failure due to pneumonia (pna), congestive heart failure (CHF), underlying COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and a tracheostomy. The patient also has a gastrointestinal bleed, thrombocytopenia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and related to pna, CHF, underlying COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and a tracheostomy. There is a potential risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or extubation failure.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed with coffee-ground emesis. There is a potential risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current condition.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia with a platelet count below 20k. There is a potential risk of bleeding complications, especially with invasive procedures or surgeries.

4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has chronic kidney disease with elevated creatinine levels. There is a potential risk of worsening renal function and the need for renal replacement therapy.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output.
   # Low [**Doctor Last Name 2946**] Output: Over the past 24 hours pt [**Name (NI) 3622**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] output has
   been noted to be poor at approx 17cc/hr since MN. Upon review of pt
   prior vital signs it appears that intermittently her [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] output will
   decrease and the start to increase. Her Creatinine has remained stable
   to 0.8, a previous Creatinine prior to hospitalization appears to be
   1.1. A spec [**Last Name (un) **] obtained shows concentrated [**Last Name (un) **]. In spite of her
   normotensive state, stable Creatinine given the increase in [**Last Name (un) **]
   output with fluid as well as a high spec [**Last Name (un) **] I suspect that she is
   still slightly hypovolemic,
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  No vomiting in >48 hours.  Hct is
   currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that
   bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless
   GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive as high as 205 overnight, responded well
   to IV hydralizine.  SBP
s this morning in 140
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - carvedilol currently at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], will consider increasing to 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if she continues to be hypertensive
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output.
   # Oliguria: Over the past 24 hours has been 17cc/hr since MN. Cr stable
   at 0.8.  likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia though other vitals are stable.
   Received fluids overnight with increase in UOP.  UA grossly positive.
   Ucx from [**11-25**] with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - start empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await ucx
   sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a [**Year (4 digits) 793**] [**Year (4 digits) **] biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 plan for [**Year (4 digits) 793**] [**Year (4 digits) **] bx,
   possibly today
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone [**Hospital1 793**] [**Hospital1 **] biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial flutter, COPD, and aortic valve replacement. She presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has had multiple extubation attempts and is currently on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy. The patient's current concerns include oliguria, hypercarbic respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a back wound.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguria: The patient has minimal urine output, which can indicate renal dysfunction or dehydration. It is important to monitor creatinine levels and ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate ventilation can lead to further respiratory failure. Close monitoring of blood gases and regular tracheostomy mask trials should be considered.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the patient's Hct is stable, there is a risk of rebleeding or ongoing blood loss. Active type and screen should be maintained, and plans for a gastrointestinal scope should be considered if bleeding recurs.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a potential risk for bleeding. Vitamin B12 supplementation has been started, and a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia.

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output.
   # Low Urine Output: Over the past 24 hours has been 17cc/hr since MN.
   Cr stable at 0.8.  likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia though other vitals are
   stable.  Received fluids overnight with increase in UOP.  UA grossly
   positive. Ucx from [**11-25**] with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - start empiric cipro, await ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  Hct  No vomiting in >48 hours.  Hct is
   currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who agreeded that
   bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not indicated inless
   GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we
   want this (however this would not examine the entire abdomen and they
   don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her
   getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has recevieved a total of
   4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a [**Year (4 digits) 793**] [**Year (4 digits) **] biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: Hypertensive as high as 205 overnight, responded well
   to IV hydralizine.  SBP
s this morning in 140
   - Continue carvedilol and diltiazem as her BP tolerates with higher
   holding parameters.
   - carvedilol currently at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], will consider increasing to 25mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if she continues to be hypertensive
   - Close monitoring as weaning sedation and pain medication
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone [**Hospital1 793**] [**Hospital1 **] biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - Restarted carvedilol
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial flutter, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and gastrointestinal bleeding. She was admitted to the hospital for hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequent intubation. The patient's current condition includes oliguria/anuria, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, hypoxia, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Low urine output: The patient has a low urine output of 17 cc/hr, which may indicate renal dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Monitoring of creatinine and continued trend of urine output is recommended.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient had previous episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring reintubation. This could be due to underlying COPD, pneumonia, or flash pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of blood gases and continued use of minimal pressure support via tracheostomy tube is advised.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed, which resulted in a decrease in hemoglobin concentration. It is important to maintain active type and screen, PICC access, and transfusion goal of >25. PPI (proton pump inhibitor) should be continued.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing, and she is at risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelets, and transfusion for platelets"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial flutter, COPD, and aortic valve replacement. She presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to failure to extubate and is currently on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Low urine output: The patient's urine output has been noted to be poor at approximately 17cc/hr since morning. There is a possibility of oliguria/anuria, which could indicate acute kidney injury or urinary tract obstruction.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count continues to decrease, currently at 46. Chronic thrombocytopenia is likely, and the patient is awaiting further evaluation, including a bone marrow biopsy.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the bleeding appears to have stabilized, there is a risk of re-bleeding, especially since the source of bleeding has not been identified. The patient is at risk for further blood transfusions and potential complications related to PEG tube placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including pneumonia (pna), congestive heart failure (CHF), underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), status post percutaneous tracheostomy (perc trach), oliguria, gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed), thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension (HTN), and mental status changes.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to multiple factors related to pna, CHF, underlying COPD, pulm HTN, and s/p perc trach. He is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and spontaneous breath trials (SBT) with the goal of transitioning to tracheostomy mask ventilation. He is also receiving medications for his conditions such as Advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids, and tuberculosis (TBB) even though it is slightly negative.

The patient has oliguria with a dirty urine analysis (UA), indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). He is now on ciprofloxacin for presumed UTI and his Foley catheter needs to be changed. His fluid status should be monitored closely.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed) with"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and recent pneumonia put him at risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has been low, indicating possible acute kidney injury. Monitoring fluid status and addressing any potential urinary tract infection is crucial.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has had coffee-ground emesis and is being managed conservatively. Maintaining active type and screen, as well as PICC access, is important for potential transfusion if necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic low platelet count, and further workup including a bone marrow biopsy may be needed. Transfusion may be considered for platelet count below 20k.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is rate-controlled but requires anticoagulation post possible"

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
   # Oliguria: Over the past 24 hours has been 17cc/hr since MN. Cr stable
   at 0.8.  likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia though other vitals are stable.
   Received fluids overnight with increase in UOP.  UA grossly positive.
   Ucx from [**11-25**] with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - start empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await ucx
   sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask again today
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   46 from 48 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy yesterday regarding
   the possibility of a bone marrow biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 plan for bone marrow bx,
   possibly today
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, SPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial flutter, COPD, and previous CABG and AVR procedures. She presented to the hospital for management of GI bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has experienced multiple extubation failures and is currently on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy and decreased urinary output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has been experiencing a low urine output of 17cc/hr over the past 24 hours. This could be due to hypovolemia, and her creatinine levels are stable at 0.8. Further monitoring of creatinine and urine output is recommended.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has led to multiple extubation failures. She is currently on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy. Another attempt to transition to a tracheostomy mask will be made today.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has had gastrointestinal bleeding, but it is not considered an acute issue. Her hematocrit levels have been stable for the past four days. No vomiting has been reported in over 48 hours. A gastrointestinal consultation obtained agreed that the bleeding was not from the PEG site, and an emergent scope is not indicated unless the bleeding worsens.

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
   # Oliguria: Continues to be low at 10-20cc/hr persistenly. Neg 500cc
   yesterday. Cr stable at 0.8.  Likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia/hypoperfusion
   though other vitals are stable.   UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-25**]
   with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - start empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await ucx
   sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask after bone marrow bx
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Her platlets continued to decrease to a level of
   44 from 46 (have been as low as 61 previously during this
   hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a plt
   transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far back
   at [**2151**]. Appreciate heme onc recs will start pt on Vitamin B12
   supplementation whilst awaiting MMA given low normal B12 levels.
   Discussed with pt
s son who is the healthcare proxy regarding the
   possibility of a bone marrow biopsy which he agreed to. UPEP, SPEP,
   MMA, peripheral smear have been collected and are currently pending.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 plan for bone marrow bx,
   possibly today
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - SPEP negative
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI change to qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial flutter (AFLUTTER), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. The patient presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure, with failure to extubate multiple times during admission.

The patient's current medical conditions include oliguria/anuria (low urinary output), hypercarbic respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and placement of a PICC line.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 158/65 mmHg to 84/18 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Laboratory results indicate the presence of anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 0.8, and urine output is low. Other lab results are within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-inch tall and 46.4 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pneumonia (pna), congestive heart failure (CHF), underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension (pulm HTN), and status post percutaneous tracheostomy (perc trach). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, tracheostomy tube, FiO2 of 35%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 77.

The patient has been experiencing oliguria, with urine output of only 285 mL in the last 24 hours. A urinalysis (UA) is dirty, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is now on ciprofloxacin for presumed UTI and has had the foley catheter changed. The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored.

The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), with hematemesis last seen 5 days ago. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, and the gastrointestinal service is managing the condition conservatively. The patient's active type and screen, as well as PICC access, are maintained. The transfusion goal is set at >25. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is given"

    # Goals of Care: Patietn expressed that she did not want any further
   treatment/  Son [**Name (NI) 420**] last night, unable to come until this
   morning.  When arrives, will discuss goals of care.
   # Oliguria: Continues to be low at 10-20cc/hr persistenly. Neg 500cc
   yesterday. Cr stable at 0.8.  Likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia/hypoperfusion
   though other vitals are stable.   UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-25**]
   with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await
   ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask.
   - Trial trach mask after bone marrow bx
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 52 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 44.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy yesterday.  Of note, plts have been as low as 61 previously
   during this hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a
   plt transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far
   back at [**2151**].
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has out patient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - SPEP negative
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI change to qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled when comfortable with
   pain and anxiety control and is otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin once pt has undergone bone marrow biopsy
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial flutter (AFL), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. The patient presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has failed extubation attempts multiple times and is currently on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient has a low urine output (10-20cc/hr), which could be due to hypovolemia or hypoperfusion. A creatinine level of 0.8 indicates some degree of renal impairment. The patient also has a positive urine analysis for yeast colonization.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced repeated episodes of hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring reintubation. She was previously extubated but had difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to underlying COPD, pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF)/flash pulmonary edema, and possibly multifactorial causes.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count of 52, which has been fluctuating during her hospitalization. A bone marrow biopsy was performed to investigate the cause of chronic throm"

   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
    # Goals of Care: Patient expressed that she did not want any further
   treatment/  Son [**Name (NI) 420**] last night, unable to come until this
   morning.  When arrives, will discuss goals of care.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask. Of note, patien
ts baseline Bicarb appears to
   be in mid 30-s
 has been maintained here in 20
s which likely is
   inhibiting her ability to tolerate trach mask as not allowing
   permissive hypercapnia.  Will trial a decrease tidal volume and
   increase resp rate which will maintain minue ventilation but allow for
   lower alveolar ventilation and therefore keep patient
s CO2 slightly
   elevated.  This should ultimately allow her Bicarb to rise to her
   baseline of 36.
   - Trial trach mask  - if successful, patient may be more comfortable
   continuing with current plan of care, will discuss at family meeting
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Oliguria: Continues to be low at 10-20cc/hr persistently. Neg 500cc
   yesterday. Cr stable at 0.8.  Likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia/hypoperfusion
   though other vitals are stable.   UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-25**]
   with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await
   ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 52 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 44.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy yesterday.  Of note, plts have been as low as 61 previously
   during this hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a
   plt transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far
   back at [**2151**].
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has out patient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - SPEP negative
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI change to qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin
 when discuss goals of care with family
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

   to discuss goals of care this morning with son as patient has expressed
   wish for no further treatment and would like to come off ventilator
   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial flutter, COPD, and previous CABG and AVR surgeries. She presented to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated three times but has failed to wean off the ventilator.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, Advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, and steroids (which have been discontinued). She is also on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 128/58 mmHg, heart rate of 64 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. Her temperature is 36.1°C (96.9°F), and she has a regular heart rhythm of atrial flutter.

The patient has several medical complications, including oliguria (low urine output), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and anemia (low hemoglobin level). She also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to the use of anticoagulation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin"

   Patient's initial bicarbonate on admission was 36 suggesting that she
   had significant hypercapnia at baseline. Her failure to come off the
   ventilator may relate to the fact that she was being over-ventilated
   leading to the kidney excreting bicarbonate (serum bicarb now 28); she
   may not be able to sustain the ventilation required with that level of
   serum bicabonate. On rounds, I placed her on trach mask. So far, she
   looks comfortable. If she tires, would use ""sprint/rest"" weaning
   strategy to strengthen muscles.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 whilst admitted
   currently on minimal pressure support via trach and decreased urinary
   output
    # Goals of Care: Patient expressed that she did not want any further
   treatment/  Son [**Name (NI) 420**] last night, unable to come until this
   morning.  When arrives, will discuss goals of care.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Was extubated [**11-5**] at OSH and
   retubated here for hypercardibic resp failure, then again extubated and
   reintubated [**2069-11-9**] with failure extubattion attempt on [**11-18**].  Likely
   multifactorial
 PNA, CHF/flash pulmonary edema and underlying COPD.
   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].  Has completed 8 day course of
   Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was trialed on a trach mask however
   she was noted to a little somnelent and hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was
   then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10, PEEP 5). Will again attempt
   transition to trach mask. Of note, patien
ts baseline Bicarb appears to
   be in mid 30-s
 has been maintained here in 20
s which likely is
   inhibiting her ability to tolerate trach mask as not allowing
   permissive hypercapnia.  Will trial a decrease tidal volume and
   increase resp rate which will maintain minue ventilation but allow for
   lower alveolar ventilation and therefore keep patient
s CO2 slightly
   elevated.  This should ultimately allow her Bicarb to rise to her
   baseline of 36.
   - Trial trach mask  - if successful, patient may be more comfortable
   continuing with current plan of care, will discuss at family meeting
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex, steroids d/c
ed [**11-20**]
   # Oliguria: Continues to be low at 10-20cc/hr persistently. Neg 500cc
   yesterday. Cr stable at 0.8.  Likely [**12-23**] hypovolemia/hypoperfusion
   though other vitals are stable.   UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-25**]
   with >100,000 yeast, likely colonization.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue empiric cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**], await
   ucx sensitivities
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 52 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 44.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy yesterday.  Of note, plts have been as low as 61 previously
   during this hospitalization and most recently as high as 122 after a
   plt transfusion.  Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as far
   back at [**2151**].
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has out patient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - UPEP, MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - SPEP negative
   - Guaiac all stools
   - HIT antibody x 1 negative, other study is pending
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 4 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 29.6 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.    IP offered to do a scope to look at
   the PEG site if we want this (however this would not examine the entire
   abdomen and they don't think the blood is from the PEG site).  Her
   family is ok with her getting a scope if GI changes their mind. Has
   recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI change to qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required overnight for first time in a
   week.  Max bp 160
s.  Was started on lisinopril 5mg qd yesterday.
   Carvedilol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday.
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting coumadin
 when discuss goals of care with family
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post CABG and AVR, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. She presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated multiple times due to failure to extubate. The patient is currently on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy and has decreased urinary output.

The patient's goals of care are discussed, with the patient expressing that she does not want any further treatment. Her son is expected to arrive soon to discuss the goals of care.

The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin/meropenem and was previously on a tracheostomy mask trial, which was unsuccessful due to somnolence and hypercapnia. It is planned to decrease tidal volume and increase respiratory rate to maintain minute ventilation while allowing for lower alveolar ventilation, aiming to raise her bicarbonate level to her baseline of 36.

The patient is oliguric with a urine output of 10-20 cc/hr and has a stable creatinine level of 0.8. A urine culture from 11/25 revealed >100,000 yeast, likely colonization. Empiric ciprofloxacin will be continued for a total of 7 days, and the patient will await UCx sensitivities. The goal is to achieve a urine output of >30 cc/hr.

The patient has thrombocytopenia"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 s/p trach placement
   whilst admitted currently on minimal pressure support via trach
   awaiting a bed at rehab.
    # Goals of Care: Discussion with the patient and son yesterday
   occurred and both agreed that she would be sent to rehab.  She has a
   bed at [**Hospital1 630**] for tomorrow.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].
   Had completed 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was
   trialed on a trach mask however she was noted to a little somnelent and
   hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10,
   PEEP 5).  Trial of trach mask did not go well yesterday as her WOBing
   increased.
   - Will check an ABG today to see if her bicarb is elevated (as it
   should be since she has COPD and at baseline should be hypercarbic).
   If WNL should decrease her ventilatory rate and or tidal volume to
   allow for some permissive hypercarbia.  This may improve her chances of
   doing well with a trach mask trial.
   - Trach mask trial once more awake.
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   # Oliguria/Fluid overload: Continues to be low with a total output
   yesterday of 343 cc.  As she is 23 L positive for her LOS and she has a
   history of systolic heart failure with a previous EF of 50% she may be
   going into CHF.  Diuresising her may improve blood flow to her kidneys
   and improve her UOP and Cr (which has increased to 1.1 today, had been
   1.0)  UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-28**] with pansensitve
   klebsiella.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**]
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   - Diurese with 20 mg IV lasix x 1 with a goal of 500 cc to 1 L negative
   today.  Will check her I/Os this afternoon and given more lasix prn.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 63 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 52.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy two days ago. Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as
   far back at [**2151**].  HIT Ab x 2 neg.  SPEP and UPEP negative.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has outpatient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 5 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 27.7 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.  Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required recently.  Max bp 140
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Patient had stopped anticoagulation as an outpatient months before
   admission.  Will not restart as this was agreeded upon with her PCP as
   an outpatient likely due to her fall/bleeding risk.
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen. The patient presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, with multiple medical complications including oliguria/fluid overload, thrombocytopenia, GI bleed, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a back wound. The patient is currently on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy and is awaiting a bed at a rehabilitation facility.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has COPD and is on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy. There is a risk of worsening hypercarbia if the patient does not tolerate a trial of tracheostomy mask or if there are issues with weaning from mechanical ventilation.

2. Oliguria/fluid overload: The patient has a low urine output and is at risk of developing acute kidney injury due to fluid overload. This can further complicate the management of her other medical conditions.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding,"

   Patient very lethargic today; has not slept in 3 days. Probably cannot
   do trach mask trials today. Will begin diuresis; has evidence of total
   body volume overload and large pleural effusions, which are likely
   contributing to ongoing respiratory failure. Check ABG and VBG
   simultaneously. I am still concerned that we may be overventilating her
   relative to what would be ideal for her. With a higher PaCO2, the
   minute ventilation she will need to generate will be less. Need acid
   stimulus to get kidney to generate bicarbonate.  Creat up slightly;
   watch with diuresis. Potassium up to 5; may relate to low urine output.
   Recheck later today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, COPD, and pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleeding, and chronic ineffective coping. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated potassium levels. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, CHF, oliguria/anuria, and chronic thrombocytopenia. The patient is unable to provide history due to being ventilated. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the mechanical ventilation settings are not adjusted properly or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially considering his history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of bleeding signs and appropriate management"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with CAD s/p CABG and AVR, AF, and COPD on home
   oxygen, presenting from OSH for management of GI bleed, and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, with failure to extubate x3 s/p trach placement
   whilst admitted currently on minimal pressure support via trach
   awaiting a bed at rehab.
    # Goals of Care: Discussion with the patient and son yesterday
   occurred and both agreed that she would be sent to rehab.  She has a
   bed at [**Hospital1 630**] for tomorrow.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:   Is s/p trach and PEG [**2154-11-20**].
   Had completed 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem. On [**11-27**] pt was
   trialed on a trach mask however she was noted to a little somnelent and
   hypercapneic on ABGs, pt was then placed back on minimal PSV (PS 10,
   PEEP 5).  Trial of trach mask did not go well yesterday as her WOBing
   increased.
   - Will check an ABG today to see if her bicarb is elevated (as it
   should be since she has COPD and at baseline should be hypercarbic).
   If WNL should decrease her ventilatory rate and or tidal volume to
   allow for some permissive hypercarbia.  This may improve her chances of
   doing well with a trach mask trial.
   - Trach mask trial once more awake.
   - continue advair, ipratropium, home xopenex
   # Oliguria/Fluid overload: Continues to be low with a total output
   yesterday of 343 cc.  As she is 23 L positive for her LOS and she has a
   history of systolic heart failure with a previous EF of 50% she may be
   going into CHF.  Diuresising her may improve blood flow to her kidneys
   and improve her UOP and Cr (which has increased to 1.1 today, had been
   1.0)  UA was grossly positive. Ucx from [**11-28**] with pansensitve
   klebsiella.
   - Will continue to trend Creatinine and monitor UOP
   - continue cipro for total of 7 days to end on [**2153-12-4**]
   - goal UOP >30cc/hr
   - Diurese with 20 mg IV lasix x 1 with a goal of 500 cc to 1 L negative
   today.  Will check her I/Os this afternoon and given more lasix prn.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt 63 this [**Last Name (un) 3241**] up from 52.  Got bone marrow
   biopsy two days ago. Per heme onc recs, likely chronic in nature, as
   far back at [**2151**].  HIT Ab x 2 neg.  SPEP and UPEP negative.
   - heme onc following, appreciate recs
 has outpatient f/u
   - Continue to trend plts
   - Transfuse for platelets < 20 or <50 if actively bleeding
   - Holding ASA and anticoagulation.
   - MMA, peripheral smear ordered and pending
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Gastrointestinal Bleeding:   Hct stable for 5 days.   No vomiting in
   >48 hours.  Hct is currently stable at 27.7 today.  GI c/s obtained who
   agreeded that bleeding was not an acute issue and emergent scope not
   indicated inless GIB worsened.  Has recevieved a total of 4units pRBC.
   - Maintain active type and screen, PICC access
   - Transfusion goal > 25
   - PPI qd
   # Hypertension: No iv medication required recently.  Max bp 140
   - Continue carvedilol, diltiazem and lisinopril, titrate up ACE-I as
   needed
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled and is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable. Currently not anticoagulated after GI bleed
   prior to presentation.
   - Continue po carvedilol as above
   - Patient had stopped anticoagulation as an outpatient months before
   admission.  Will not restart as this was agreeded upon with her PCP as
   an outpatient likely due to her fall/bleeding risk.
   # Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD and SVG to RCA).
   - carvedilol as above
   - Consider restarting ASA once platelets are stable and no evidence of
   ongoing GI bleed
   #Back Wound: Patient with stage II ulcer on back from burn injury at
   [**Location (un) **]. Wound care seen, appreciate recs. Dressings per recs. Stopped
   steroids (can contribute to skin thinning).
   # Aortic Valve Replacement (bioprosthetic):  Not anticoagulated.
   Performed in [**2147**]. TTE here with EF 50%, severe pulm regurg and mild
   pulm HTN.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented to the hospital for management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and completed an 8-day course of antibiotics. However, she has failed three extubation attempts and is currently on minimal pressure support via tracheostomy. The patient's goals of care include sending her to rehabilitation, and she has a bed available at Hospital1 starting tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is characterized by increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and potentially worsen her condition. The healthcare team plans to monitor her blood gases and adjust ventilatory settings accordingly.

2. Oliguria/Fluid Overload: The patient has low urine output, with a total output of 343 cc yesterday. She also has a history of systolic heart failure and a previous ejection fraction (EF) of 50%. These factors increase her risk for congestive heart failure (CHF). Diuretics may be used to improve her urine output and reduce fluid overload.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of confusion in the morning and persistent bradycardia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/47 to 171/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is 46.4 kg, and height is 60 inches. The patient has received various medications including Heparin sodium, RISS, Peridex, Reglan, Diltiazem, Lisinopril, Coreg, Atrovent, Prevacid, simethicone, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating chronic respiratory failure. Weaning trials should be conducted, and the pleural effusions should be addressed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is chronic and stable.
3. Chronic kidney failure: The patient has oliguria/anuria, suggesting chronic kidney failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of benign hypertension, which is currently controlled.
5. Atrial flutter: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter, which is rate-controlled.
