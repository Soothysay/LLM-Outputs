","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease (PUD), angioectasias, and previous radiation therapy. He presents with hematemesis, and the source of bleeding is still unclear. The patient has received pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion, erythromycin, and morphine sulfate. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is alert and oriented, but there is evidence of fatigue. The abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness without guarding. The patient has crackles in the chest and peripheral edema in both extremities.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 44.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 15.8%, platelet count of 152 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 149 mg/dL, potassium level of 7.2 mEq/L, sodium level of 113 mEq/L, chloride level of 25.3%, and magnesium level of 1.5 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of PT/PTT/INR, calcium, and phosphate.

The patient's assessment includes unclear source of hematemesis, possible PUD, angioectasias, or another cause. The plan includes continuing pantoprazole infusion, inserting four large-bore peripheral intravenous lines, crossmatching at least four units of blood, keeping the patient nil per os (NPO), and monitoring the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. A repeat scope is planned today to further evaluate the source of bleeding and discuss the need for intubation with the gastroenterology team. If pain persists without visual findings on endoscopy, a computed tomography (CT) scan will be performed to evaluate the etiology of the pain. The patient's hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and gout are being managed accordingly. The patient's anemia and MDS are also being addressed."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and prior gastrointestinal bleeding due to angioectasias. He presents with hematemesis, which is likely upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from multiple possible sources including peptic ulcer disease (PUD), arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or Dieulafoy's lesion. 

The patient has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and started on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and erythromycin. An endoscopy was attempted but was unsuccessful due to a large clot burden in the stomach and a possible aspiration event. The patient required intubation for future scopes. 

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has fallen from 20.5 to 15, and he has received a total of six units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain a target hemoglobin level of 24. 

The patient also has hyperkalemia, which has been treated with calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, kayexalate, and furosemide. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.9Â°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 116/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. 

Physical examination reveals epigastric tenderness, crackles in the chest, and trace edema in the extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and hyperkalemia. 

The patient's plan includes continued PPI infusion, nasogastric tube placement, transfusion of additional PRBCs, urgent gastrointestinal scope in the ICU, and surgical consultation. Further imaging may be necessary if pain persists and no findings are seen on endoscopy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, respiratory distress, and further electrolyte imbalances."

   76 y/o M w/transfusion dependent MDS and GI bleeds of multiple
   etiologies who presents with hematemesis.
   1. Upper GI bleed:  Differential is broad especially given his multiple

   severe abd pain), AVMs, Dieulafoy's, gastritis.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable & not having further hematemesis.  Hct
   20->15->29->24 with 6 units.
   - GI following; plan for EGD this AM
   - Surgery following; no indication for OR at this point
   - KUB negative for free air
   - Check Hct q4h.  Crossmatch 4 additional units.
   - PPI infusion
   - check lactate but doubt mesenteric ischemia given how much better he
   looks today
   2. Acute renal failure:  Likely volume depletion in setting of GI
   bleed.  Will volume resuscitate & continue to monitor.
   3. Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to acute renal failure.  No significant
   ECG changes (perhaps mild peaked T's.)  Treated with kayexalate,
   insulin/D50, calcium.
   4. DM:  Insulin sliding scale.
   5.  HTN: Holding given GI bleed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and previous gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds who presents with hematemesis. The patient has been transfusion-dependent and has had multiple etiologies for his GI bleeds in the past. 

The patient's current assessment includes upper GI bleed, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and MDS. 

For the upper GI bleed, the differential diagnosis includes peptic ulcer disease (PUD), arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), Dieulafoy's lesion, and gastritis. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has not had further episodes of hematemesis. The plan is to proceed with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) this morning, and surgery is not indicated at this time. The patient will continue to be monitored for any signs of deterioration.

Regarding the acute renal failure, it is likely due to volume depletion in the setting of the GI bleed. The patient will be volume resuscitated and closely monitored.

The hyperkalemia is likely due to acute renal failure as well. There were no significant ECG changes, so the patient was treated with kayexalate, insulin/D50, and calcium.

For the DM, insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control.

As for the HTN"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds presenting with hematemesis. He underwent an endoscopy that was unsuccessful due to significant blood and clot in the stomach. The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight, resulting in a hematocrit response from 29% to 24%. His potassium level was 7.2, and he showed peaked T waves on the EKG. Calcium, lasix, insulin/D50, and kayexalate were administered. The patient has allergies to NSAIDs and meningitis type. He is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion, morphine sulfate, dextrose 50%, insulin regular, and furosemide (Lasix). The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for mildly improved abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient's history of multiple GI bleeds and severe abdominal pain suggest a high likelihood of an upper GI bleed. Further evaluation through an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's presentation of volume depletion in the setting of a GI bleed indicates a potential risk for acute renal failure. Close monitoring and volume resuscitation are recommended.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o M w/transfusion dependent MDS and GI bleeds of multiple
   etiologies who presents with hematemesis.
   1. Upper GI bleed:  Differential is broad especially given his multiple
   GI bleeds in past, including PUD (highest on differential given his
   severe abd pain), AVMs, Dieulafoy's, gastritis.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable & not having further hematemesis.  Hct
   20->15->29->24 with 6 units.
   - GI following; plan for EGD this AM
   - Surgery following; no indication for OR at this point
   - KUB negative for free air
   - Check Hct q4h.  Crossmatch 4 additional units.
   - PPI infusion
   - check lactate but doubt mesenteric ischemia given how much better he
   looks today
   2. Acute renal failure:  Likely volume depletion in setting of GI
   bleed.  Will volume resuscitate & continue to monitor.
   3. Hyperkalemia:  Likely due to acute renal failure.  No significant
   ECG changes (perhaps mild peaked T's.)  Treated with kayexalate,
   insulin/D50, calcium.
   4. DM:  Insulin sliding scale.
   5.  HTN: Holding given GI bleed.
   6. MDS: transfusion dependent.  Will follow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, who presented with hematemesis and abdominal pain. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to significant blood loss and has a current hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 24.2%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has mild peaked T waves on the electrocardiogram (ECG).

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 44.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, potassium of 7.2 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29.2 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, glucose of 149 mg/dL, and platelet count of 152 K/uL. The ECG shows no significant changes except for mild peaked T waves.

The patient's physical examination reveals a JVP around 5, a third heart sound (S3), and crackles at the right lung base. The"
