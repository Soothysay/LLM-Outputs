","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She presented with an acute to subacute drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) most likely due to upper GIB. The patient remains hemodynamically stable with no signs of active bleeding. She is currently on IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and being closely monitored by the gastroenterology (GI) team for potential upper endoscopy (EGD) today or EGD + colonoscopy tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: There is a risk of rebleeding from the source of the upper GIB.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of various lines and tubes.
3. Cardiac issues: Given her history of CHF, there is a potential for cardiac complications such as worsening heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Renal dysfunction: As the patient has ESRD, there is a risk of worsening renal function, especially if she undergoes repeated hemodialysis sessions.
5. Thromboembolic events: Due to her immobilization and underlying risk factors, the patient is at an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She presented with an acute to subacute drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) likely due to upper GIB. The patient's current condition is stable without further melena overnight after two units of blood transfusion. She is hemodynamically stable with improved Hct. She is well-appearing, well-nourished, and without acute distress. Physical examination shows no significant abnormalities. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is alert and oriented with intact cranial nerves and normal strength in all extremities. Laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, platelets, and electrolytes, but elevated creatinine and lactic acid levels. The patient has been placed on proton pump inhibitors, and further endoscopy or colonoscopy will be considered. The plan includes continued close monitoring, blood transfusion if Hct drops below 25, and follow-up procedures.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's history of ischemic colitis, lower GIB, and ESRD, potential medical complications may include:
1. Re-bleeding: There is a risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further drops in hemoglobin levels and potentially worsen the patient's condition.
2. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She presented with an acute to subacute drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct), which was initially thought to be due to upper or right-sided GIB. The patient remains hemodynamically stable, and no signs of active bleeding were observed after receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's Hct has trended down, but she showed an appropriate jump following the PRBC transfusion.

The patient is scheduled for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) today, with the possibility of a colonoscopy tomorrow if no findings are seen during the EGD. The patient's ESRD management includes hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with a discussion needed regarding her true dry weight as she may be receiving excessive ultrafiltration.

The patient also has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and diabetes mellitus (DM), both of which are stable. In the ICU, the patient is receiving appropriate care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full, and she is currently located in Hospital Unit 44.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Re-bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic colitis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She presented with an acute to subacute hemoglobin concentration (Hct) drop, likely due to upper GIB. The patient remains hemodynamically stable with no signs of active bleeding. 

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of ischemic colitis and lower GIB suggests a potential risk for upper GIB. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to further bleeding and hemodynamic instability.
2. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a history of chronic systolic CHF. If her cardiac function deteriorates, it may result in worsening fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Diabetic complications: The patient has DM, which increases her risk for various complications such as hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hypoglycemia if not properly managed.
4. ESRD complications: As the patient is on HD, she is at risk for complications associated with ESRD such as electrolyte imbalances, uremic symptoms, and infections.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): Immobility in the ICU setting can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 81-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, and chronic renal failure. She presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed and has been hemodynamically stable. The patient received transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has increased appropriately. No bleeding source was visualized during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient will need to undergo a colonoscopy due to her history of ischemic colitis. She is expected to go for dialysis today and her electrolytes are within acceptable ranges without any acidosis. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving regular insulin for glycemic control. She has two peripheral IV lines and is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code and she is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding: Although no bleeding source was visualized during EGD, the patient's history of GI bleed and ischemic colitis may increase the risk of further bleeding during the colonoscopy.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's chronic renal failure puts her at risk for worsening kidney function, especially if there are complications during the dialysis process.
3. Infection"
