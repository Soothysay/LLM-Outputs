   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with history of CAD, subdural hematoma who presented to [**Hospital1 536**] on [**2108-11-24**] with epigastric abdominal pain, vomiting, and
   abnormal LFTs.
   #. Fevers / hypotension:
   Likely sepsis related to acute cholangitis given fevers, bandemia,
   abdominal pain, LFT elevations to the 200s, and MRCP findings of CBD
   debris. ERCP will be definitive treatment if this is acute colangitis;
   and patient is now agreeing to procedure. Additionally, could consider
   that patient has sepsis of urinary origin given she has a known UTI
   with gram positive cocci.
   - Appreciate ERCP recs
   - Keep patient on Zosyn for cholangitis and UTI coverage
   - Added Vancomycin [**11-25**] for additional empiric coverage for presumed
   cholangitis and sepsis of unclear etiology
   - Hold home antihypertensives
   - Titrate levophed dosing to acheive MAP > 65
   - Check CVP then consider bolus with IVF to attempt to liberate patient
   from levophed, however with good UOP, mentation now seems that patient
   is euvolemic
   - [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 **] blood and urine culture data
   - Obtain new urine and blood cultures here
   - obtain new aline
   #. Coronary artery disease:
   Patient received three troponins at [**Hospital3 474**]. The first two were
   only 0.03, though the third trop at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to 0.15. Possible that
   this was a trop leak in the setting of hypotension and resulting demand
   ischemia, though must rule out ACS as cause of hypotension and observed
   HCT drop.
   - EKG this AM
   - Continue home clopidogrel
   - Hold isosorbide mononitrate, lisinopril, atenolol while patient
   hypotensive and requiring pressors
   #  thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology though is on heparin sc
   - recheck in pm
   # goals of care: patient expresses passive refusal of procedures like
   ERCP as she states that she does not want to live any more.  She also
   endorses depression and crying spells.  Patient agrees to most specific
   procedures on ICU consent form though does not want compressions or
   shock because she states she witnessed a hospital roommate experience
   this.  Theses seem like two different issues and the team agrees that
   if the patient is refuses a potentially life-saving procedure, she
   should be made full aware of the risks and benefits and this should be
   discussed with her son, her HCP.  Regarding DNR status, it seems that
   this has been reached through thoughtful consideration on the patient
   part and we should facilitate the communication of this wish between
   patient and her HCP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and subdural hematoma who presented to the hospital with epigastric abdominal pain, vomiting, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with cholecystitis, likely secondary to acute cholangitis, as indicated by fevers, bandemia, abdominal pain, elevated liver enzymes, and MRCP findings of common bile duct debris.

The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, possibly of urinary origin due to a known urinary tract infection with gram-positive cocci. Empiric coverage for cholangitis, UTI, and sepsis is being provided with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin. The patient's condition is unstable with hypotension and requires vasopressor support with norepinephrine.

The patient has expressed passive refusal of procedures like ERCP, stating that she does not want to live anymore. She also endorses depression and crying spells. The patient agrees to most specific procedures on the ICU consent form but does not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The team agrees that if the patient refuses a potentially life-saving procedure, she should be made aware of the risks and benefits, and this should be discussed with her son and healthcare provider.

The patient's goals of care include avoiding procedures like ERCP, not wanting to experience cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, subdural hematoma, and diabetes who presented to the hospital with epigastric abdominal pain, vomiting, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis, acute cholangitis, urinary tract infection, and coronary artery disease. She is currently in the ICU requiring vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis of unclear etiology: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, including fevers, bandemia, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes. It is important to consider the possibility of sepsis of urinary or cholangitis origin. The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending.

2. Acute cholangitis: The patient's symptoms and MRCP findings suggest acute cholangitis. ERCP may be a definitive treatment if this is confirmed, but the patient is currently refusing the procedure.

3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recent troponin levels have shown some elevation. It is important to rule out acute coronary syndrome as a cause of the patient's hypotension and observed hematocrit drop.

4. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes and requires management with a diabetic diet, fingerstick glucose monitoring, and medication adjustment.

5. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive and required vasopressor support."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, subdural hematoma, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and cholecystitis. She presented to the hospital with epigastric abdominal pain, vomiting, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and was found to have sludge and stones in her bile ducts. A stent was placed during the procedure. Post-procedure, she experienced hypotension and required a pressor and fluid bolus. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, bacteremia due to gram-negative organisms, and acute cholangitis. She has been started on antibiotics for coverage against cholangitis and a urinary tract infection. 

The patient's blood cultures grew gram-negative organisms, and her urine culture showed the presence of gram-positive cocci. 

She has a history of depression and has expressed passive refusal of further aggressive treatment, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), but she may allow short-term intubation for a short period of time.

The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including clears for nutrition, diabetic diet, prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and pain management. Her blood pressure remains"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, subdural hematoma, who presented to the hospital with epigastric abdominal pain, vomiting, and abnormal liver function tests. She underwent an ERCP procedure and was found to have sludge and stones in her bile duct, for which a stent was placed. Post-procedure, she experienced hypotension and required pressor support. Blood cultures grew a gram-negative organism, and she is being treated with antibiotics for cholangitis and UTI coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTENSION: The patient has been experiencing hypotension post-ERCP procedure. It is important to closely monitor her blood pressure and provide appropriate fluid boluses or adjust levophed dosing to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
2. RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to potential acute renal failure, which can be a complication of sepsis and prolonged hypotension.
3. CHEST PAIN: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and chest pain should be evaluated promptly to rule out any cardiac complications.
4. SEIZURE: The patient has a history of seizure, and any new onset seizure symptoms should be evaluated and managed appropriately.

   benefits and this should be discussed with her son, her HCP.  Regarding
   DNR status, it seems that this has been reached through thoughtful

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, subdural hematoma, who presented to the hospital with epigastric abdominal pain, vomiting, and abnormal liver function tests. She has been diagnosed with acute cholangitis, GNR bacteremia, and acute renal failure. She is currently on antibiotics for cholangitis and UTI coverage, and additional empiric coverage for presumed cholangitis and sepsis. She also has hypotension, for which gentle fluid boluses are being administered, and her blood pressure is being titrated to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >65. She has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and cholecystitis. She has expressed passive refusal of procedures like ERCP, but agrees to most specific procedures in the ICU consent form, except for compressions or shock. She has been made DNR and her wishes regarding code status and intubation have been documented. She is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and subdural hematoma. She presented to the hospital with epigastric abdominal pain, vomiting, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The initial diagnosis was likely sepsis related to acute cholangitis, given her fevers, bandemia (low white blood cell count), abdominal pain, LFT elevations to the 200s, and ERCP findings of pustular exudate, stones, and sludge.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics for cholangitis and urinary tract infection coverage. Vancomycin was stopped as the patient remained afebrile. The patient also has coronary artery disease, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and diabetes.

The patient expressed passive refusal of procedures like ERCP, stating that she does not want to live anymore. However, she agrees to most specific procedures on the ICU consent form, except for compressions or shocks. The team agrees that if the patient refuses a potentially life-saving procedure, she should be made full aware of the risks and benefits, and this should be discussed with her son, her healthcare provider. The patient's DNR status has been reached through thoughtful consideration, and it should be facilitated to communicate this wish between the patient and her healthcare provider.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and subdural hematoma, presented to the hospital with epigastric abdominal pain, vomiting, and abnormal liver function tests. She was diagnosed with cholangitis and bacteremia caused by a Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteria, likely due to an ERCP procedure. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis related to acute cholangitis and GNR bacteremia. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be a result of sepsis or other underlying conditions. Gentle fluid boluses are being administered as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low but stable at 128. Monitoring of platelet levels and appropriate management will be necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD, which requires further evaluation and management. F/u echo results and hold of certain medications are mentioned in the progress note.
5. Diabetes: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 90 and low 200. Tight"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient was admitted with cholangitis and GNR sepsis and has been receiving a two-week course of antibiotics (Zosyn). The patient's blood pressure has improved to baseline levels, and there have been improvements in urine output and creatinine levels. The patient's white blood cell count is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock and subsequent development of acute renal failure indicates a potential complication of sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management will be necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypertension and current hypotension should be closely monitored, especially considering the previous episode of septic shock. Measures to maintain blood pressure within a normal range will be essential.
3. Infection: Despite receiving a two-week course of antibiotics, there is still a risk of ongoing or new infections. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms will help identify any potential infections.
4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which increases the risk for cardiovascular complications. Continuous monitoring of cardiac status and appropriate management will be necessary.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, which may require close monitoring of blood glucose levels and insulin therapy as part of glycemic control.
