","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, obesity, and gastric bypass surgery. She presented with pyelonephritis and urosepsis. She meets SIRS criteria with bandemia, tachycardia, and left ureteral fat stranding on imaging, as well as a urinary analysis indicating infection. The patient received 7 liters of normal saline in the emergency department and was placed on pressors. She has a right internal jugular (IJ) line and arterial line in place. She is now hemodynamically stable off pressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 92/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg. She has received various medications including cefepime, vancomycin, lansoprazole, and morphine sulfate.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely prerenal due to sepsis and hypotension, which is resolving with intravenous fluids. There is a question of cholecystitis, but it is unlikely given normal liver function tests and absence of left upper quadrant pain. The patient also has microcytic anemia, thought to be related to gastric bypass surgery, low B12, and low iron.

The plan includes continuing IV fluids, repleting electrolytes as needed, and maintaining a regular diet. Prophylactic measures include PPI, heparin subcutaneously, and a bowel regimen. The patient's code status is full code. Disposition information is provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient has already presented with urosepsis, which is a severe infection of the urinary tract that has spread throughout the body. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely prerenal in nature due to sepsis and hypotension. This can progress to intrinsic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Microcytic anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, which may be related to gastric bypass surgery, low B12 levels, and low iron levels. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms if not managed properly.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized in the ICU, there is a risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin are being taken, but close monitoring is necessary.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adherence to proper ventilation practices are essential to prevent this complication."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and obesity who underwent gastric bypass surgery. She presented with pyelonephritis and urosepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's low blood pressure and sepsis may have caused pre-renal acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
2. Microcytic Anemia: The patient's anemia is believed to be related to gastric bypass surgery, low B12 levels, and low iron. Further evaluation and management of anemia should be considered.
3. Cholecystitis: Although the patient has abdominal pain, it is unlikely to be caused by cholecystitis due to normal liver function tests and absence of left upper quadrant pain. Further imaging or intervention for cholecystitis may not be needed at this time.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Properly managing the patient's airway and implementing appropriate infection control measures are crucial.
6. Sepsis: The patient is already"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 year-old woman with a history of hypertension, obesity s/p gastric
   bypass presenting with pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
   # Urosepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with bandemia, tachycardia, and left
   ureteral fat stranding and UA with evidence of infection.  Received 7L
   of NS in ED and on pressors.  Right IJ and A-line in place.  Off
   pressors and now HD stable.
   - MAP > 60 and SV02 at goal (>70%)
   - blood cultures
   - cefepime pending cultures
   - can d/c vanc
   - f/u culture data
   - will defer pulling CVL back 2 cm as may become unstable on skin;
   likely will not need line beyond today
   # Acute renal failure:  Likely prerenal in setting of sepsis and
   hypotension.
   - resolving with IVFs
   # Question cholecystitis:  Unlikely given normal LFTs and absence of
   LUQ pain.
   - f/u surgery reccs
   - on antibx for sepsis
   - would not pursue further imaging
   # Microcytic anemia:  Thought to be related to gastric bypass, low B12,
   low iron.
   - guaiac stools
   - banana bag per surgery
   # Headache: similar to baseline headaches, will start ibuprofen
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, obesity, and gastric bypass surgery. She presented with pyelonephritis and urosepsis. She meets the criteria for urosepsis with bandemia, tachycardia, and left ureteral fat stranding on imaging, as well as urinary analysis indicating infection. The patient received 7 liters of normal saline in the emergency department and was on pressors but is now hemodynamically stable off pressors. She has a central venous line and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The plan is to switch to oral levofloxacin due to nausea with ciprofloxacin IV. Vancomycin can be discontinued, and culture data will be followed until finalized. The consideration for removing the central venous line today will be made. The patient also has acute renal failure likely due to sepsis and hypotension, which has resolved with intravenous fluids. Questionable cholecystitis is unlikely given normal liver function tests and absence of left upper quadrant pain. Microcytic anemia is thought to be related to gastric bypass, low B12, and low iron. The patient has a history of headaches, for which ibuprofen has been started. The patient's diet will be advanced, and she will continue with prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The plan is to remove the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis caused by Escherichia coli. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. He experienced nausea and dry heaving after receiving IV ciprofloxacin, so the medication was switched back to oral ciprofloxacin, which he had previously received. The patient received IV fluid boluses to improve blood pressure and was encouraged to increase oral intake. His allergies include Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim). The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and his last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are provided. Physical examination findings are not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's blood culture grew Escherichia coli (>100,000 organisms/mL). The assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, obesity, and gastric bypass surgery. She is currently admitted to the ICU with pyelonephritis and urosepsis. The patient meets SIRS criteria with bandemia, tachycardia, and evidence of infection in the left ureter. She has received 7 liters of normal saline in the emergency department and was on pressors, but is now hemodynamically stable. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to prerenal causes in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.
2. Microcytic anemia related to gastric bypass surgery, low B12, and low iron levels.
3. Headache similar to baseline headaches, which has been managed with ibuprofen.
4. Potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and central venous line (CVL) placement.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
6. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest and immobility.
7. Malnutrition and poor glycemic control due to inadequate nutrition support.
8. Clostridium difficile infection due to antibiotic use.
9. Delirium or cognitive impairment due to sepsis and ICU stay.
10. Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction or cardiac complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, obesity, and gastric bypass surgery. She is currently admitted to the ICU with pyelonephritis and urosepsis. The patient meets the SIRS criteria with bandemia, tachycardia, and left ureteral fat stranding on imaging, along with a urinary analysis indicating infection. She received 7 liters of normal saline in the emergency department and was on pressors, but is now hemodynamically stable off pressors. The patient has a central venous line (CVL) placed in the emergency department.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient is already experiencing urosepsis, which is a serious complication of a urinary tract infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely prerenal due to sepsis and hypotension. If not managed appropriately, it could progress to intrinsic renal failure.
3. Central venous line (CVL) infection: The patient has a CVL placed, which increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or local symptoms at the insertion site, is necessary.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability in critically ill patients increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophyl"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of GNR sepsis and pyelonephritis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently showing improvement. The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, s/p gastric bypass surgery, and multiple vitamin deficiencies. His allergies include Bactrim DS (oral), and he has received antibiotics such as vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/83 to 93/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg, with total input and output balanced. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, symmetric breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurological assessment is not complete due to limited assessment. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal glucose levels. Assessment and plan include sepsis with presumed pyelonephritis, stable hemodynamics, improving flank pain, targeted antibiotic therapy, removal of Foley catheter, management of iron deficiency anemia, pain control, and ongoing ICU care."
