   Assessment and Plan
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)
   80 yo male with no significant PMH, admitted with ALL, initial WBC 137
   with 88% blasts, uric acid of 22 on admission.
   #. Acute myeloid leukemia:
   Presented to hospital with approximately one week of fatigue, anorexia,
   and weight loss. Noted to have initial WBC count of 138k with 84%
   blasts. Was treated initially with leukopheresis and has received total
   of 4 doses of hydroxyurea. Course has been complicated by tumor lysis
   syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
   - Continue Hydroxyurea 2500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for two additional doses and then
   readdress additional chemotherapy as per bone marrow transplant team
   recommendations
   #. Tumor lysis syndrome:
   Laboratory evidence of tumor lysis has been worsening since initiation
   of treatment of AML. Has received rasburicase. Currently has potassium
   of 3, uric acid of 2.5, phosphate of 11.5, and LDH 2700.
   - Appreciate nephrology recs
   - Paradoxic decrease in potassium due to renal wasting and potassium
   should be aggressively repleted per nephrology recs
   - Maintain alkalemia with goal serum bicarb of 30 to 34
   - Maintain adequate urine output for renal protection
   - Continue Aluminum Hydroxide as well as allopurinol to control phos
   and uric acid leves
   .
   #. Hypotension:
   Likely caused by hypovolemia as patient has been fluid responsive with
   small boluses on the BMT floor. Additional supporting evidence is that
   patient has low urine output, thirst, and visibly dry mucous membranes.
   Patient is without ECHO evidence of systolic dysfunction.
   - Monitor closely during dialysis
   - Fluid bolus as needed to support blood pressure
   #. Hypoxia:
   Likely multifactorial with contributions from pneumonia, edema, and
   possible leukemic infiltrate. Patient with cough productive of thick
   yellow sputum at this time. Presented to the ICU on vancomycin and
   cefepime; however, his pneumonia likely a product of community
   exposure, so he should receive antibiotics for community pathogens. As
   far as edema is concerned, patient is clinically dry and has had
   relative hypotension, so diuresis would be difficult in this setting.
   - Treat AML as above
   - Send sputum for gram stain and culture
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime
   - Addition of levofloxacin 750 mg Q48H for coverage of
   community-acquired pathogens
   #. Disseminated intravascular coagulation:
   Currently with FDP 80-160, INR 1.7, PLT 11, Fibrinogen 181. Patient has
   not required cryoprecipitate or FFP at this point. Platelet count is
   rapidly falling, though no evidence of bleeding at this point.
   - Monitor Q6H PTT, INR, FDP, fibrinogen, platelets
   - Trend HCT while platelets dropping and elevated INR
   - Platelet transfusion now with post-transfusion PLT count
   - Treat fibrinogen < 100 with cryoprecipitate
   - Treat INR > 2.0 with FFP

   Disposition: ICU for blood pressure monitoring peri-dialysis
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He presented to the hospital with fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and a high white blood cell count. The patient has received leukapheresis and hydroxyurea treatment for his leukemia. However, he has developed tumor lysis syndrome and DIC.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, likely due to hypovolemia, hypoxia with possible pneumonia, and DIC. The patient's laboratory values show abnormalities such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low platelet count, and abnormal coagulation parameters.

The assessment and plan include continuing hydroxyurea treatment for leukemia, aggressive repletion of potassium due to renal wasting, maintenance of alkalemia, and adequate urine output for renal protection. The patient should also receive antibiotics for community-acquired pathogens, and close monitoring of his blood pressure during dialysis is recommended.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, ongoing tumor lysis syndrome, and persistent or worsening DIC. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for signs of worsening pneumonia. Additionally, the patient's bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy needs to be assessed regularly.

In summary, the patient is an elderly male with a history of ALL, acute renal failure, and DIC. He"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with no significant past medical history, admitted with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). He presented with fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and a high white blood cell count with a majority of blasts. He received leukopheresis and hydroxyurea treatment. The course has been complicated by tumor lysis syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): The patient has a high white blood cell count with 84% blasts, indicating AML. He has received hydroxyurea treatment and requires additional chemotherapy as per bone marrow transplant team recommendations.
2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient has shown laboratory evidence of worsening tumor lysis since initiation of treatment for AML. He has received rasburicase and currently has improved laboratory values. However, aggressive repletion of potassium and maintenance of urine output are required. Continued use of aluminum hydroxide and allopurinol is also necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to hypovolemia, as evidenced by fluid responsiveness and low urine output. Close monitoring during dialysis and fluid bolus administration as needed are recommended.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be caused by pneumonia, edema, or possible leukemic infiltrate. He should receive antibiotics for community-ac"

 DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION (DIC)
   80 yo male with no significant PMH, admitted with ALL, initial WBC 137
   with 88% blasts, uric acid of 22 on admission.
   #. Acute myeloid leukemia: Presented to hospital with approximately one
   week of fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. Noted to have initial WBC
   count of 138k with 84% blasts. Was treated initially with leukopheresis
   and has received total of 4 doses of hydroxyurea. Course has been
   complicated by tumor lysis syndrome and disseminated intravascular
   coagulation.
   - readdress additional chemotherapy as per bone marrow transplant team
   recommendations- will likely have 2 additional doses ordered beyond the
   single dose already ordered for today and then possibly Gemcitabine
   #. Tumor lysis syndrome:
   Laboratory evidence of tumor lysis has been worsening since initiation
   of treatment of AML but improved since dialysis. Has received
   rasburicase. Currently has potassium of 4.2, uric acid of 1.0,
   phosphate of 5.2, and LDH 2565.
   - Appreciate nephrology recs
   - Paradoxic decrease in potassium due to renal wasting and potassium
   should be aggressively repleted per nephrology recs
   - Plan was serum bicarb of 20-34 in order to excrete UA, but as UA
   decreased, ? if need to still give bicarb.  Will ask renal.
   - Maintain adequate urine output for renal protection: has been 30-130
   cc/hr
   - Continue Aluminum Hydroxide as well as allopurinol to control phos
   and uric acid leves
   #. Hypotension: Likely caused by hypovolemia as patient has been fluid
   responsive with small boluses on the BMT floor. Additional supporting
   evidence is that patient has low urine output, thirst, and visibly dry
   mucous membranes. Patient is without ECHO evidence of systolic
   dysfunction.
   - Monitor closely during dialysis
   - Fluid bolus as needed to support blood pressure
   #. Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial with contributions from pneumonia,
   edema, and possible leukemic infiltrate. Patient with cough productive
   of thick yellow sputum at this time. Presented to the ICU on vancomycin
   and cefepime; however, his pneumonia likely a product of community
   exposure, so he should receive antibiotics for community pathogens. As
   far as edema is concerned, patient is clinically dry and has had
   relative hypotension, so diuresis would be difficult in this setting.
   - Treat AML as above
   - Send sputum for gram stain and culture
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime
   - Addition of levofloxacin 750 mg Q48H (D1:[**1-8**]) for coverage of
   community-acquired pathogens
   #. Disseminated intravascular coagulation:
   Currently with FDP 80-160, INR 1.5, PLT 31, Fibrinogen 280. Patient has
   not required cryoprecipitate or FFP at this point. Platelet count is
   rapidly falling, and has been transfused X1 without evidence of
   bleeding
   - Monitor Q8H PTT, INR, FDP, fibrinogen, platelets
   - Trend HCT while platelets dropping and elevated INR
   - Treat fibrinogen < 100 with cryoprecipitate
   - Treat INR > 2.0 with FFP

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), admitted to the ICU for treatment. The patient presented with fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. The initial WBC count was 138k with 84% blasts. He has been treated with leukopheresis and received a total of 4 doses of hydroxyurea. The course has been complicated by tumor lysis syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's laboratory evidence of tumor lysis has been worsening since the initiation of treatment for AML but improved since dialysis. He has received rasburicase and is currently being managed with aggressive repletion of potassium, as well as controlling uric acid and phosphate levels.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's DIC is currently being monitored with regular PTT, INR, FDP, fibrinogen, and platelet counts. Treatment includes cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen levels below 100 and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for INR greater than 2.0.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely caused by hypovolemia. Fluid responsiveness has been observed with small boluses on the BMT floor. Close monitoring during dialysis and fluid bolus as needed are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who presented to the hospital with symptoms including fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. He was treated with leukopheresis and received a total of four doses of hydroxyurea. The patient's course has been complicated by tumor lysis syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of AML, characterized by an initial white blood cell count of 138k with 84% blasts. He has been treated with leukopheresis and hydroxyurea but requires additional chemotherapy as per the bone marrow transplant team.
2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient has laboratory evidence of tumor lysis that has been worsening since the initiation of treatment for AML but has improved since dialysis. He has received rasburicase and his labs are currently stable after stopping continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has DIC with stable fibrinogen, coags, and FDP levels. He has not required cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion so far. His platelet count is rapidly falling, and he may need another transfusion today. Monitoring of PTT, INR,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with no significant past medical history, admitted with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He presented with fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. His initial white blood cell count was 138k with 84% blasts. He received leukopheresis and hydroxyurea treatment. His course has been complicated by tumor lysis syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient has laboratory evidence of tumor lysis that worsened since initiation of treatment for AML but improved after dialysis. He received rasburicase. His labs are currently stable after stopping continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). 
   - Continue decreased dose of hydroxyurea today and tomorrow.
   - Readdress additional chemotherapy as per bone marrow transplant team, may plan for decitabine next week.
   - Appreciate nephrology recommendations.
   - Paradoxic decrease in potassium due to renal wasting should be aggressively repleted per nephrology recommendations.
   - Will alkalinize urine per renal recommendations to prevent uric acid crystal accumulation.
   - Maintain adequate urine output for renal protection.
   - Continue Aluminum Hydroxide as well as allopurinol to control phosphorus and uric acid levels.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely caused by hypov"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is being treated for DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), tumor lysis syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and potential complications such as hypoxemia and hypotension. The patient has been receiving hydroxyurea for AML treatment and is awaiting plans for further chemotherapy. They are also being monitored for DIC, with serial labs and appropriate transfusions as needed. The patient's tumor lysis syndrome labs have improved, but they will continue to monitor and alkalinize the urine. The patient's hypoxemia is being treated with antibiotics due to functional neutropenia, and their hypotension has resolved, likely due to hypovolemia. The patient is on a renal diet and has an order for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and they are being dispositioned to the floor for further care after consultation with the bone marrow transplant team."
