   # Tachypnea: Noted to have pulmonary edema on initial CXR, improved on
   follow up post intubation.  CTA showed severe bilateral ground-glass
   opacity representative of pulmonary edema and foci of nodularity
   superimposed, which may be consistent with an
   infectious pneumonic consolidation.  Last hospitalization [**Date range (1) 3069**]
   treated with 7 day course of Levo/Vanco for ? MRSA PNA.  All culture
   data from that admission is negative.  Currently intubated.
   - Will start empiric antibiotics based on CT read of possible
   infection.  Levofloxacin, Vancomycin for now.
   - Check sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - No anticoagulation as question of pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage.

   # Hypertensive urgency: Also an issue for him last admission.  Started
   on nitro gtt in the ED.
   - Continue nitro gtt.
   - Start oral antihypertensives as tolerated.  As an outpatient he takes
   Toprol, Nifedipine, Lisinopril.  Will start with Toprol as pt admitted
   with elevated potassium.
   - Consider checking echocardiogram to evaluate

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and poorly-controlled hypertension. He presented with dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency. He was initially treated for suspected MRSA pneumonia during his last hospitalization, but all culture data from that admission was negative. Currently, he is intubated due to pulmonary edema and possible infection. The patient has multiple medical complications including tachypnea, hypertensive urgency, anion gap acidosis, hyperkalemia, and ESRD requiring hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient's rapid breathing may be a result of pulmonary edema and/or an infectious pneumonic consolidation. Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed promptly to prevent further complications such as stroke or heart attack.
3. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's low blood pH indicates an acidosis condition. Further evaluation and management are required to determine the underlying cause and correct it.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Immediate treatment is necessary to lower the potassium levels and prevent complications.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Possible Infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and poorly-controlled hypertension. He presented with dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency. Initial chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, which improved after intubation. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed severe bilateral ground-glass opacity, indicating pulmonary edema and a question of pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. The patient's blood pressure was severely elevated. 

The patient also experienced hematemesis, and there is a possibility of coagulopathy due to uremia. He has an NG tube in place, and a GI consult has been considered if the bleeding persists. The patient is on hemodialysis per his outpatient regimen, three times a week. He is also on sevelamer for ESRD. 

The patient presented with anion gap acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure and uremia. Hyperkalemia was observed, with potassium levels ranging from 6.5 to 7.4. The patient received calcium, insulin, and glucose to correct the hyperkalemia. 

The patient has multiple medical issues, including hypertension, ESRD, pulmonary edema, and potential pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. He requires careful monitoring and management of his conditions, including blood pressure control, dialysis, electrolyte balance, and potential bleeding complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and hypertension urgency. They are sedated, intubated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent dialysis yesterday and has been diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are concerns about potential bleeding, possibly due to uremic platelets, and a CT scan is needed to determine if there is edema or hemorrhage. The patient has a history of cocaine use, and the presence of cocaine in their urine is noted. The patient's vital signs show high blood pressure and normal oxygen saturation. Fluid balance reveals a significant negative balance of 3,961 mL, indicating a loss of fluids. The patient's labs indicate elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and troponin T, while other values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This condition can lead to further lung complications and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure readings throughout the day suggest uncontrolled hypertension. If not managed properly, it may lead to organ damage or other cardiovascular events.

3. Bleeding: The presence of dark hem+ fluid in the OG tube suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. Given the patient's potential coagulopathy and history of cocaine use, there is a risk of additional bleeding episodes.

4. Infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and hypertension urgency. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/62 mmHg to 229/152 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has a history of intravenous drug use and cocaine use, as indicated by the presence of cocaine in the urine toxicology screen. The patient has also undergone dialysis yesterday and is currently receiving propofol infusion for sedation. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 467 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory acidosis.

The patient's physical examination shows well-nourished general appearance, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and symmetric chest expansion. The patient has a tunneled dialysis catheter in place, which appears fine. Abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and an orogastric tube with dark hemolytic fluid. Extremity examination shows absent peripheral pulses on the right side and present pulses on the left side."

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and poorly-controlled hypertension presenting with dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency. He has been intubated and is currently extubated. The patient has a history of hematemesis and has received an NG tube lavage. There are concerns about pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, as shown by a CT chest scan. The patient's electrolytes are imbalanced, with hyperkalemia and anion gap acidosis. He is on hemodialysis and requires optimization of blood pressure control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Alveolar Hemorrhage: The CT chest scan shows diffuse bilateral ground-glass alveolar opacity concerning for pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and hypoxemia.
2. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and if not controlled, it can lead to organ damage and other complications.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has presented with high potassium levels, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's blood pH is low, indicating acidosis, which can result in confusion, lethargy, and respiratory depression.
5. Uremic Toxins: Due to ESRD, the patient's kidneys are unable to effectively remove waste products, leading to the accumulation"

","Summary:
The patient's chief complaint is hypertension (HTN). The patient was extubated yesterday morning and had a minimal amount of blood in the NGT lavage. Antibiotics were stopped as there were no signs of infection. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/87 to 221/128 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight is currently 65.7 kg and height is 68 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 903 mL and output of 470 mL. The patient is off drips but taking gabapentin, ppi, lisinopril, metoprolol, and nifedipine. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some gastrointestinal issues mentioned below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has been diagnosed with a likely gastrointestinal bleed due to the OG tube. Although there were no reported episodes of vomiting or hematemesis, the presence of blood in the NGT lavage suggests a possible GIB. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent further bleeding.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show significant fluctuations, ranging from 119/39 to 221/128 mmHg. This indicates"
