   57 y.o. man with DM, HTN, and paranoid schizophrenia, presents from
   inpatient Psych facility altered mental status
   .
   # Altered mental status: This episode could certainly represent
   worsening of psychiatric disease, though other etiologies must be ruled
   out. Most concerned about primary CNS process, especially
   meningitis/encephalitis, other infection (though CXR clear and UA
   clear), medication effect (though no fever and not rigid as would
   expect from NMS), and seizure activity (though no prior history and
   unlikely to be status with patient's vocal outbursts and movements).
   Head CT normal and CSF reassuring.
   - Will discuss significance of macrophages on LP and elevated protein
   with Neurology.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to schitzophrenia.
   - D/C Vanc/Cef/Amp as meningitis unlikely
   - cover acyclovir 10 mg/kg q8h (700 mg) pending PCR results
   - MRI head later today, with Vecuronium for paralysis and increased
   propofol sedation
   - F/U neuron recs
   - goal to extubate post MRI
   - if agitation persists, could re-dose with haldol with close
   monitoring of QTc and aggressive lyte repletion
   - appreciate psychiatric input
   - Will r/o syphilis by RPR, CSF studies FTABS and VDRL
   - Will do EEG once off sedation.

   # Respiratory alkalosis: Resolved on intubation
   .
   # metabolic acidosis: Gap closed.  Acidosis is compensatory for acute
   respiratory alkalosis.  Lactate normalized
   .
   # Recent syncopal event:  Further history casts doubt on whether there
   was such an event.  Would consider Echo if concerned.
   .
   # Anemia: MCV low 80s, hct 33. Last Hct in our system several years ago
   38. Got IVF so likely dilutional but will continue to monitor.  Hct up
   today.  Ferritin was 200, does not need Iron.
   - trend Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Elevated CK: Trending down today.   Likely related to patient's
   struggling against restraints and tensing of muscles. Continue to trend
   with MB & troponin though cardiac ischemia unlikely.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Could also be related to muscle damage and unclear if
   normal at baseline. Does have slightly elevated ALT at [**Hospital1 5**] from [**2110**].
   If chronic, could be related to antipsychotic medications.
   - trend transaminases
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Would like to resume oral medications as soon as
   possible, especially clozaril.
   - resume medications PO when able

   # Altered mental status: This episode could certainly represent
   worsening of psychiatric disease, though other etiologies must be ruled
   out. Most concerned about primary CNS process, especially
   meningitis/encephalitis. Plan for head CT followed by lumbar puncture
   if no mass lesions. However, his current agitation precludes head
   imaging without intubation. Other reasons for this agitation/delirium
   could be other infection (though CXR clear and UA clear), medication
   effect (though no fever and not rigid as would expect from NMS), and
   seizure activity (though no prior history and unlikely to be status
   with patient's vocal outbursts and movements).
   - urgent head CT once intubated
   - plan for LP after head CT if no mass effect
   - cover for bacterial meningitis with vancomycin 1 g q12h, ceftriaxone
   2 g q12h, and ampicillin 2 g q6h
   - droplet precautions until rule out meningitis
   - cover acyclovir 10 mg/kg q8h (700 mg)
   - if CT/LP unrevealing, plan for MRI head later today
   - Neurology consultation for other etiology

   compensation with metabolic acidosis.

   # AG metabolic acidosis: compensatory for acute respiratory alkalosis,
   accompanied by elevation in lactate. Repeat ABG once intubated to make
   re-evaluate lactate and pH.

   # Recent syncopal event: ? etiology and workup that accompanied the
   event. Could be [**1-7**] hypovolemia though other considerations include
   intracranial pathology or cardiac pathology.
   - attempt to obtain records from [**Hospital1 586**]/[**Hospital1 587**]
   - head imaging as above
   - ECHO to evaluate LV function, valves

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, and paranoid schizophrenia admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure. He was intubated for acute psychosis and combativeness, and his CK level is elevated. A lumbar puncture was performed, and respiratory precautions were discontinued. The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to worsening psychiatric disease, a primary central nervous system process such as meningitis or encephalitis, medication effect, or seizure activity. Urgent head CT followed by lumbar puncture is planned if no mass lesions are present. The patient is also covered for bacterial meningitis with antibiotics and antiviral coverage is provided. Other potential causes for the altered mental status are being evaluated. The patient has respiratory alkalosis, AG metabolic acidosis, and anemia. The elevated CK level is likely related to struggling against restraints and muscle tension. Transaminitis may be related to muscle damage or antipsychotic medications. The patient's schizophrenia medication should be resumed as soon as possible. The patient has diabetes type 2, hypertension, and is currently normotensive. He is NPO for now, and his electrolytes should be repleted due to QT lengthening. Prophylactic measures such as SC heparin and bowel medications are being considered."
199781.0,271151,2113-08-17 07:45:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"24 Hour Events:
   - Had MRI yesterday and was extubated post procedure
   - Stopped all abx but continued acyclovir until HSV PCR clears
   - CSF showed macrophages with siderotic granules, still unclear on the
   significance of this
   - Echo was suboptimal but unrevealing
   - Got 25mg of IV Haldol and 4mg of IV Ativan without much improvement
   of agitation.
   - Then pt developed a fever to 101.9. Concern for NMS vs infection.
   Re-cultured and stopped any further injections of haldol.
   - Switched to Precedex.
   - At approx 5:30 am, pt settled down, but then became apneic, perhaps
   [**1-7**] to resp alkalosis.  Pressures were also low at that time, SBPs
   80s.  Stopped Precedex for 5 minutes and apnea resolved and pressures
   increased to 90s-100s.
   - More appropriate and less agitated this morning.  Reports that he is
   thirsty and tired.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with suspected HSV encephalitis. He underwent an MRI and was extubated post-procedure. Antibiotics were stopped, but acyclovir was continued until the HSV PCR results were available. A CSF analysis showed macrophages with siderotic granules, but the significance is unclear. An echo was suboptimal but unrevealing. The patient received 25mg of IV Haldol and 4mg of IV Ativan for agitation, but there was no improvement. He then developed a fever of 101.9, and there is concern for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) versus infection. Further injections of Haldol were stopped, and the patient was switched to Precedex. At around 5:30 am, the patient became apneic, possibly due to respiratory alkalosis, with low pressures and SBPs in the 80s. Precedex was temporarily stopped, and the apnea resolved with increased pressures in the 90s-100s. The patient is now more appropriate and less agitated this morning, reporting thirst and tiredness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): The patient's lack of response to Haldol and subsequent development of fever raises concern for NMS, which is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by adverse reactions to neuroleptic or antipsychotic"

   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

   1. Small bilateral subdural fluid collections, left greater than right,

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y.o. man with DM, HTN, and paranoid schizophrenia, presents from
   inpatient Psych facility altered mental status
   .
   # Altered mental status: Most likely delirium superimposed on chronic
   psychiatric illness, though other etiologies must be ruled out. Most
   concerned about primary CNS process, especially
   meningitis/encephalitis, other infection (though CXR clear and UA
   clear), medication effect, and seizure activity (though no prior
   history and unlikely to be status with patient's vocal outbursts and
   movements).
   - MRI only showed small bilat chronic subdurals and no ischemia.
   - Will discuss significance of macrophages on LP and elevated protein
   with Neurology.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to schitzophrenia.  Otherwise, CSF only
   significant for increased protein.  Gram stain and crypto antigen were
   negative.
   - D/C Vanc/Cef/Amp as meningitis unlikely
   - cover acyclovir 10 mg/kg q8h (700 mg) pending PCR results
   - Following extubation, pt was acutely agitated.  Attempted to treat
   with Haldol while closely monitoring QTc and lytes.  However, pt was
   too agitated to check lytes as needed.  Also, pt developed a fever.
   Due to concern of NMS, held Haldol.  However, most likely not NMS given
   his lack of rigidity.
   - Tried Precedex which provided good control for several hours.
   However, by early morning, his BP was no longer tolerating high enough
   doses to suppress his agitation.
   - Will follow up with psych regarding next best treatment.
   - RPR, CSF studies FTABS and VDRL- pending
   - Also, TSH pending per psych
   - Will do EEG once off sedation.

   # Respiratory alkalosis:
   - Had resolved when intubated, but worsened once extubated due to pt
   constant screaming and heavy breathing.
   # metabolic acidosis: Gap closed.  Acidosis is compensatory for acute
   respiratory alkalosis.  Lactate normalized
   .
   # Recent syncopal event:  Further history casts doubt on whether there
   was such an event.  Would consider Echo if concerned.

   # Anemia: MCV low 80s, hct 33. Last Hct in our system several years ago

   today.  Ferritin was 200, does not need Iron.
   - trend Hct
   - guaiac stools

   # Elevated CK: Trending down today.   Likely related to patient's
   struggling against restraints and tensing of muscles. Continue to trend
   with MB & troponin though cardiac ischemia unlikely.  Also, could
   signify NMS
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Could also be related to muscle damage and unclear if
   normal at baseline. Does have slightly elevated ALT at [**Hospital1 5**] from [**2110**].
   If chronic, could be related to antipsychotic medications.
   - trend transaminases
   .
   # Schizophrenia: Would like to resume oral medications as soon as
   possible, especially clozaril.
   - Can resume [**Hospital1 **] dosing of Clozaril when able to take po and when sure
   his BP can tolerate the med

   # DM2: Hold oral hypoglycemics. FS Q6h. Cover with RISS.

   # Hypertension: Not on meds at home. Has been slightly hypotensive with
   the precedex.  Continue to monitor.  Becomes tachycardic when acutely
   agitated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, and paranoid schizophrenia who presented from an inpatient psychiatric facility with altered mental status. He was initially intubated and received vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin for suspected meningitis. However, further tests including MRI, CSF analysis, and blood cultures did not reveal any evidence of infection or ischemia. The patient was extubated and acyclovir was started due to a suspicion of herpes simplex virus encephalitis, although the significance of macrophages in the CSF is still unclear. 

The patient's agitation post-extubation was unresponsive to haloperidol, leading to concerns of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Haloperidol was discontinued, and the patient was started on precedex, which initially controlled his agitation. However, his blood pressure could no longer tolerate the high doses, and precedex was stopped. The patient's fever resolved after stopping haloperidol.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80s/50s to 90s/60s, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is awake and alert but occasionally asks inappropriate questions. Physical examination findings include 2+ peripheral pulses, regular heart rhythm, clear lung sounds"
199781.0,271151,2113-08-17 07:45:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"24 Hour Events:
   - Had MRI yesterday and was extubated post procedure
   - Stopped all abx but continued acyclovir until HSV PCR clears
   - CSF showed macrophages with siderotic granules, still unclear on the
   significance of this
   - Echo was suboptimal but unrevealing
   - Got 25mg of IV Haldol and 4mg of IV Ativan without much improvement
   of agitation.
   - Then pt developed a fever to 101.9. Concern for NMS vs infection.
   Re-cultured, got a CXR, and stopped any further injections of haldol.
   - Switched to Precedex.
   - At approx 5:30 am, pt settled down, but then became apneic, perhaps
   [**1-7**] to resp alkalosis.  Pressures were also low at that time, SBPs
   80s.  Stopped Precedex for 5 minutes and apnea resolved and pressures
   increased to 90s-100s.
   - More appropriate and less agitated this morning.  Reports that he is
   thirsty and tired.

   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]:
   1. Small bilateral subdural fluid collections, left greater than right,
   as
   described above. These are most consistent with chronic subdural
   hematomas.
   2. No evidence for ischemia or infection.
   Assessment and Plan
   57 y.o. man with DM, HTN, and paranoid schizophrenia, presents from
   inpatient Psych facility altered mental status
   .
   # Altered mental status: This episode could certainly represent
   worsening of psychiatric disease, though other etiologies must be ruled
   out. Most concerned about primary CNS process, especially
   meningitis/encephalitis, other infection (though CXR clear and UA
   clear), medication effect (though no fever and not rigid as would
   expect from NMS), and seizure activity (though no prior history and
   unlikely to be status with patient's vocal outbursts and movements).
   Head CT normal and CSF reassuring.
   - Will discuss significance of macrophages on LP and elevated protein
   with Neurology.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to schitzophrenia.
   - D/C Vanc/Cef/Amp as meningitis unlikely
   - cover acyclovir 10 mg/kg q8h (700 mg) pending PCR results
   - MRI head later today, with Vecuronium for paralysis and increased
   propofol sedation
   - F/U neuron recs
   - goal to extubate post MRI
   - if agitation persists, could re-dose with haldol with close
   monitoring of QTc and aggressive lyte repletion
   - appreciate psychiatric input
   - Will r/o syphilis by RPR, CSF studies FTABS and VDRL
   - Will do EEG once off sedation.

   # Altered mental status: Most likely delirium superimposed on chronic
   psychiatric illness, though other etiologies must be ruled out. Most

   meningitis/encephalitis, other infection (though CXR clear and UA
   clear), medication effect, and seizure activity (though no prior

   - MRI only showed small bilat chronic subdurals and no ischemia.
   - Will discuss significance of macrophages on LP and elevated protein
   with Neurology.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to schitzophrenia.  Otherwise, CSF only
   significant for increased protein.  Gram stain and crypto antigen were
   negative.
   - D/C Vanc/Cef/Amp as meningitis unlikely
   - cover acyclovir 10 mg/kg q8h (700 mg) pending PCR results
   - Following extubation, pt was acutely agitated.  Attempted to treat
   with Haldol while closely monitoring QTc and lytes.  However, pt was
   too agitated to check lytes as needed.  Also, pt developed a fever.
   Due to concern of NMS, held Haldol.  However, most likely not NMS given
   his lack of rigidity.
   - Tried Precedex which provided good control for several hours.
   However, by early morning, his BP was no longer tolerating high enough
   doses to suppress his agitation.
   - Will follow up with psych regarding next best treatment.
   - RPR, CSF studies FTABS and VDRL- pending
   - Also, TSH pending per psych
   - Will do EEG once off sedation.
