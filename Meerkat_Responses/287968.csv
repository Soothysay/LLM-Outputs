","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH cirrhosis who presented with hematemesis. She underwent emergent endoscopy but was unable to tolerate it, and subsequently, an NG tube was placed. Despite receiving blood transfusions, the patient continued to have bright red blood in the NG output. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although her blood pressure is low. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. She is alert and oriented, with a slight yellow hue to her sclera. She has regular heart sounds and clear lung sounds. The patient's abdomen is soft but uncomfortable upon palpation of the RUQ. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding, and bowel sounds are present. She has warm and well-perfused extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient's primary concern is ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding from known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices. This condition requires close monitoring and management.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which can cause thrombocytopenia. It is important to monitor the platelet count and consider transfusion if it falls below a certain threshold.
3. Osteoarthritis: The patient takes oxycodone for osteoarthritis, but has been switched to fentanyl as an inpatient. It is important to manage her pain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis who presented to the ICU with hematemesis. She was unable to tolerate an emergent endoscopy and an NG tube was placed, initially draining dark blood but turning more red overnight. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) initially, followed by two more units due to persistent bright red blood in the NG tube. She is currently on octreotide drip, pantoprazole, midazolam, and fentanyl infusions. Her vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing discomfort on palpation of the right upper quadrant (RUQ). The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count. She has a known history of grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (due to esophageal and gastric varices)
2. Hypovolemic shock (due to significant blood loss)
3. Hepatic encephalopathy (due to worsening liver function)
4. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
5. Coagulopathy (elevated prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time/information ratio)
6. Renal dysfunction (due to hypoperfusion)
7. Infection (due to immunocompromised state)
8. Hepatic hydrothorax (accum"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, currently admitted to the ICU for TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) revision due to ongoing bleeding from esophageal varices. The patient underwent 8 sessions of variceal banding performed by interventional radiology (IR), and is currently hemodynamically stable.

The patient has a fever of 102.3°F (38.2°C) and is on multiple infusions including midazolam, octreotide, and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 107/57 mmHg to 201/108 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 100% on endotracheal tube ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 97-168 mg/dL.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 4.1 K/uL and platelet count (Plt) of 64. Other lab values such as hemoglobin (Hct), creatinine (Cr), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal the presence of an endotr"

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of esophageal varices and gastric varices who presented with hematemesis. She underwent TIPS revision and extensive coiling of IVC duplicated varices. She is currently sedated, hemodynamically stable, and appears to be doing well.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. GI bleed: The patient has known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices, which have been coiled with a [Last Name (un)] tube in place. Continuous monitoring and management of the tube, along with ongoing octreotide drip, are necessary to prevent rebleeding.
2. EtOH cirrhosis: The patient's MELD score is 12, indicating advanced liver disease. Management includes continuing rifaxamin and lactulose to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy and bacterial infections, discontinuing ciprofloxacin, and holding spironolactone.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is likely reduced due to cirrhosis. Transfusion should be considered if the platelet count is below 50,000 and there is active bleeding.
4. Osteoarthritis: The patient takes oxycodone for pain management. Fentanyl has been started as an inpatient, which will continue.
5. Fluid and electrolyte balance: Intravenous fluids should be given to maintain fluid balance and replete electroly"

","The patient is a 45-year-old lady with a history of variceal bleeding, who presented with hematemesis and underwent TIPS revision and extensive coiling of IVC duplicated varices. She is currently sedated and hemodynamically stable, appearing to be doing well. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her condition and treatment. These include:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices that are now s/p coiling with an [**Last Name (un) 4601**] tube in place. There was no bleeding overnight, but the plan is to untie the tube per hepatology, check CBC 3 hours post, continue octreotide drip at 50/hour, consult hepatology, and remain intubated while the tube is in place.

2. Fever: The patient is febrile overnight, which could be due to gut translocation and aspiration pneumonia. Repeat CXR is pending with [**Last Name (un) **] cultures. The plan is to follow cultures, fever curve, administer antibiotics as guided by culture data, remain intubated until pneumonia is ruled out, and consult hepatology.

3. EtOH Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of ethanol cirrhosis with a MELD score of 12 as of [**12-4**]. The plan is to continue rifaxamin, lactulose with the goal"

   A 45 year old lady with variceal bleeds presented with hematemesis now
   s/p TIPS revision and extensive coiling of IVC duplicated varices.  She
   is sedated, hemodynamically stable and appears to be doing well.
   1. GI Bleed: Known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices
   that are now s/p coiling with [**Last Name (un) 4601**] tube discontinued.  No bleeding
   overnight.
   -continue octreotide drip at 50/hour
   -consult hepatology
   -Pantoprazole 40 IV Q 12
   - Remain intubated and attempt to wean midaz and start propofol
   -Place NG tube in anticipation of OG tube
   -Q 6 hours HCT
   #.  Fever:  Patient febrile overnight, possible causes include gut
   translocation & aspiration PNA.  Repeat CXR with worsening of Right
   effusion, pan cultures pending.
   -          Follow Cultures, fever curve and stop Tylenol to see if
   spike
   -          Abx as guided by culture data
   -          Attempt paracentesis this afternoon to see if infection
   # EtOH Cirrhosis: MELD score as of [**12-4**] was 12.
   - continue rifaxamin, lactulose w/ goal of 3 BM per day
   -On Ceftriaxone
   -Hold spironolactone
   # Thrombocytopenia: Recent range 72-100,000.  Likley from cirrhosis.
   -          transfuse if plt ct < 50,000 and active bleeding
   -          Recheck PM platelets
   # Osteoarthritis: takes oxycodone as an outpatient
   -started on fentanyl as inpatient, will continue

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old lady with a history of variceal bleeds, currently admitted to the ICU for TIPS revision and extensive coiling of IVC duplicated varices. She presented with hematemesis but no bleeding overnight. The patient is sedated, hemodynamically stable, and appears to be doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices that were recently coiled. There is a risk of rebleeding, and ongoing monitoring is necessary.
2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be due to gut translocation, aspiration pneumonia, or another infection. Repeat chest X-ray shows worsening right effusion, and cultures are pending.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, likely due to cirrhosis. This increases the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusion should be considered if the platelet count is below 50,000 and there is active bleeding.
4. Osteoarthritis: The patient takes oxycodone for osteoarthritis, but she has been started on fentanyl as an inpatient. It is important to continue monitoring her pain management.
5. Fluid and Electrolyte Disorder: The patient has fluid and electrolyte imbalances that require ongoing monitoring and repletion.
6. Risk for Aspiration: The patient has an inability"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, resulting in hypotension and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient was resuscitated and intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and inability to protect own airway. 

Overnight, the patient developed a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (100.9 degrees Fahrenheit). Despite receiving platelet transfusion, the platelet count did not increase, so another unit of platelets was transfused. The patient also received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a drop in hemoglobin from 32 to 28 in six hours. 

An orogastric lavage did not reveal evidence of continued bleeding, but the patient continues to have melanotic stools. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 121/62 mmHg, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a FiO2 of 40%. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, platelet count of 47 K/uL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4. 

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, and octreotide.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 45-year-old lady with a history of variceal bleeds. She underwent a TIPS revision and extensive coiling of IVC duplicated varices. Currently, she is sedated and hemodynamically stable. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices that are currently being managed with an [**Last Name (un) 4601**] tube in place. It is important to monitor for any signs of rebleeding.
2. Fever: The patient developed a fever overnight, which could be due to gut translocation or aspiration pneumonia. Further evaluation, including repeat chest X-ray and culture, is necessary to determine the cause.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, ranging from 36,000 to 100,000. This could be attributed to her underlying cirrhosis. Close monitoring and transfusion if the platelet count falls below 50,000 and active bleeding is present.
4. Osteoarthritis: The patient takes oxycodone for pain management as an outpatient, but has been started on fentanyl as an inpatient. It is important to consider pain management options while ensuring the patient's safety.
5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has ongoing fluid losses through various routes, including NG tube drainage"

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices that were recently coiled. She is at risk for further bleeding, and it is important to continue octreotide drip at 50/hour to help reduce the risk of bleeding.

2. Fever: The patient has a fever overnight, which could be due to gut translocation or aspiration pneumonia. Pan cultures are pending, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered based on the culture data.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to cirrhosis. If her platelet count drops below 50,000 and she has active bleeding, transfusion should be considered.

4. Osteoarthritis: The patient takes oxycodone for osteoarthritis, but has been switched to fentanyl as an inpatient. It is important to continue monitoring her pain management needs.

5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which need to be carefully managed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, risk for aspiration, fever of unknown origin, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient underwent attempted paracentesis but had an insufficient fluid pocket. A repeat hematocrit (HCT) was performed, and a nasogastric (NG) tube was placed. The patient was transitioned off fentanyl/midazolam and onto propofol. Tylenol was stopped to monitor the fever curve, which remained at 99 degrees throughout the day. The patient has allergies to meperidine and unknown allergies. The last dose of antibiotics, ceftriaxone, was administered on 12/22/2164 at 09:08 PM. The patient is currently receiving propofol at 25 mcg/kg/min and octreotide at 50 mcg/hour. Morphine sulfate was added to the ICU medications on 12/23/2164 at 12:00 AM. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for noted below. 

Flow Sheet Data as of 12/23/2164 06:33 AM:
Vital signs: Temperature (Tmax: 37.4 C or 99.4 F; Tcurrent: 37.4 C or 99.3 F), Heart rate (HR: 92 bpm with a range of 76-112 bpm), Blood pressure (BP: 161/104 mmHg with a range of 89/43-161/114 mmHg), Respiratory rate (RR: 10 breaths per minute with a range of 8-18 breaths per minute), Oxygen saturation (SpO2: 100%). Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device are also documented.

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to patient's altered mental status and inability to protect airway. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 45,000/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 87,000/uL, and slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 16 mg/dL. Sodium, potassium, and chloride levels are within normal range. Liver function tests are also within normal limits. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with altered mental status, risk for aspiration, fever of unknown origin, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and gastrointestinal bleed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications due to the inability to protect the airway and risk for aspiration.
2. Infection or sepsis due to the presence of fever of unknown origin.
3. Electrolyte imbalance due to fluid disorder.

","The patient is a 45-year-old lady with a history of esophageal varices and gastric varices, who presented with hematemesis and is currently in the ICU. She underwent TIPS revision and extensive coiling of IVC duplicated varices. The patient is sedated, hemodynamically stable, and appears to be doing well. However, she has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed.

1. GI Bleed: The patient has known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices, which were coiled but are still at risk for bleeding. She is receiving octreotide to reduce portal pressure and prevent further bleeding. Pantoprazole is being given to reduce stomach acid production. The patient's NG tube has been placed in anticipation of an OG tube placement.

2. Fever: The patient had a fever overnight, which could be due to gut translocation and aspiration pneumonia. Repeat chest X-ray showed worsening right effusion, and cultures are pending. The patient's fever curve should be monitored, and antibiotics should be started based on culture data.

3. EtOH Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis with a MELD score of 12. She is being treated with rifaximin and lactulose to manage her condition. Spironolactone is being held.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, likely due to cirrhosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presenting with variceal bleeding. She underwent a TIPS procedure and extensive coiling of IVC duplicated varices. The patient is sedated but hemodynamically stable, and her recent Hct levels have remained stable. She was successfully extubated without difficulty. 

The patient has several ongoing issues that require management:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices that were coiled. No bleeding has occurred for the past two days, and her Hct levels have remained stable. She will continue octreotide drip at 50/hour and pantoprazole 40 IV Q 12. If the patient worsens, she may require repeat embolization and stabilization with the use of a [**Last Name (un) 4601**] tube.
2. Fever: The patient developed a fever overnight, which may be due to gut translocation or aspiration pneumonia. Cultures are pending, and the fever curve has plateaued. Antibiotics will be held except for SBP prophylaxis, and the patient will be monitored for any changes.
3. EtOH Cirrhosis: The patient has a MELD score of 12. She will continue rifaximin and lactulose to manage her condition. She is on ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of variceal bleeds, who presented with hematemesis and has undergone TIPS revision and extensive coiling of IVC duplicated varices. She is currently sedated but hemodynamically stable. The patient was extubated without difficulty and has shown no bleeding for the past two days, with stable Hct levels. She is being closely monitored for potential complications such as GI bleed, fever, electrolyte imbalances, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has known grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices, which were recently coiled. Although there has been no bleeding for the past two days, there is still a risk of rebleeding, especially if the coagulation factors are not fully normalized.

2. Fever: The patient developed a fever overnight, and possible causes include gut translocation and aspiration pneumonia. Repeat chest X-ray showed unchanged right effusion, and cultures are pending. The fever curve plateaued, and antibiotics will be held except for SBP prophylaxis while waiting for culture results.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -2,957 mL, indicating possible ongoing fluid losses. This could be due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes of fluid sequestration.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is sedated but not delirious. There"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-inch tall individual who was previously on invasive ventilation but has now been extubated and is pain apparently well controlled. The patient has allergies to Meperidine and unknown allergies. The last dose of antibiotics administered was Ceftriaxone on [**2164-12-22**] 09:08 PM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of Octreotide at 50 mcg/hour and Haloperidol (Haldol) since [**2164-12-23**] 10:00 AM. Additionally, the patient received a dose of Morphine Sulfate at [**2164-12-24**] 05:54 AM.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 74 bpm with a range of 70-127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/58 mmHg to 170/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute with a range of 9-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows sinus rhythm with no specific heart rhythm abnormalities. The patient's fluid balance indicates an input of 1,093 mL total, with 200 mL given intravenously. Output includes 4,050 mL of blood products, 1,160 mL of urine, 430 mL of nasogastric drainage, and a negative balance of -2,957 mL.

The patient is on respiratory support using a nasal cannula and PSV/SBT mode on the ventilator. The tidal volume is set at 506 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 0 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 0%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided. The minute ventilation is 4.3 L/min.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not performed, skin assessment not performed, and neurologic assessment not assessed.

Laboratory values show white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 2.5 to 4.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 28.6% to 32.8%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 36 to 47 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level at 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 70 to 121 mg/dL, and other lab results including PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests.

Assessment and plan include altered mental status, risk for aspiration due to inability to protect airway, fever of unknown origin, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and gastrointestinal bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications due to the patient's previous invasive ventilation and current use of a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery.
2. Infection or sepsis, as indicated by the fever of unknown origin.
3. Electrolyte imbalance and fluid disorder, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and renal dysfunction.
4. Gastrointestinal bleed, which may present with hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
6. Stress ulcer due to the patient's critical condition and ICU stay.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for these potential complications and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."
