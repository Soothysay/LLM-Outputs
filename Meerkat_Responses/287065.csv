   Getting aranesp only to avoid transfusions but family refused it last
   week (think causes inc secretions) so said maybe this week. Will give
   to him there if they will accept it. Baseline K 4.5-5.5. Baseline WBC
   [**11-21**]. Not been diuresing. No fevers. Had black tarry stools 2-3 weeks
   ago and was put on ppi but hct never dropped and thought might be
   related to intake not bleed. Scrotum always ""massive"". MS baseline is:
   opens eyes occasionally, non responsive. Will grimace to painful
   stimuli and occ flex legs. No spontaneous movement. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13877**] had
   talked to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2249**] on Friday to ask whether a stent would help but
   because it would have necessitated a transfer to ICU here for unclear
   benefit this was deferred however now that he's here if Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2249**] wants
   to do it that would be fine.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and anoxic brain injury. He was admitted with hypoxia that is now resolving and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's baseline hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is 28-29, and his potassium levels are 4.5-5.5. The patient has not been diuresing, and there are no fevers. He experienced black tarry stools two to three weeks ago and was put on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but his Hct never dropped and might be related to intake rather than bleeding. The patient's mental status (MS) baseline includes opening his eyes occasionally, being non-responsive, grimacing to painful stimuli, and occasionally flexing his legs. There is no spontaneous movement. The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and experienced anaphylaxis. He was started on invasive ventilation on 03/17/2018 at 10:19 AM, and a bronchoscopy was performed on the same day at 05:54 PM. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/73 to 171/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

 Would like to get him back to [**Hospital1 **] as soon as
   trach tube is replaced,
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and anoxic brain injury. The patient was admitted with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure at baseline with ABG showing a low oxygen level (7.33) indicates an underlying respiratory problem. Increased peak inspiratory pressures and plateau pressures suggest possible upper airway obstruction due to worsening tracheomalacia, trach malposition, or mucous plugging. This can lead to further respiratory distress and may require immediate intervention.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, but it has since resolved. The etiology and severity of the hypotension are unclear as there is no record of it from the rehab. The restart of anti-hypertensives should be closely monitored.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had hyperkalemia, which has since resolved. It is important to recheck potassium levels upon arrival to the floor and continue monitoring on telemetry.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been in sinus rhythm with rates between 45-80. It is important to monitor on telemetry and consider anticoagulation if necessary.

5. Chronic Foley Catheter and Inoperable Hernia: The patient has a chronic f"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and anoxic brain injury. He was admitted with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 151/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 66 mmHg, and PaO2 of 338 mmHg. His lab results indicate elevated potassium levels (K+ of 4.3 mEq/L), low hemoglobin (Hct of 24.5%), and elevated white blood cell count (WBC of 6.1 K/uL). 

The patient has a Foley catheter in place, and his urine output is within normal limits. His physical examination reveals no cyanosis, clubbing, edema, or warmth in the extremities. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure has worsened, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This is likely due to upper airway obstruction caused by worsening tracheomalacia, tracheostomy tube malposition, or mucous plugging. The patient's ABG values have improved after"

   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient with chronic respiratory
   failure at baseline with ABG on last admission 168/67/7.33. Increased
   peak inspiratory pressures and plateau pressures possible upper airway
   obstruction from either worsening tracheomalacia, trach malposition, or
   mucous plugging. Improved with suction (ABG 7.24/84/132 ->
   7.34/66/134), appears to be at respiratory baseline.  Bronch yesterday
   showed granulation tissue blocking trachea, which may intermittently
   cause episodes of respiratory distress.  IP plans to replace trach tube
   with new type which should cover this tissue.
   - IP replacement of trach tube
   - Continue nebs
   - D/C abx as no evidence of PNA
   - Suction PRN to avoid mucous plugging, being cautious not to
   manipulate tissue flap in a way that causes occlusion

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and anoxic brain injury. He was admitted with hypoxia now resolving and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, invasive ventilation, and bronchoscopy. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 151/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His ABG results show partial improvement, with a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 66 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 338. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for an enlarged scrotum with a Foley catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and current hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and timely intervention are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Tracheostomy Complications: The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, which carries the risk of complications such as infection, displacement, or obstruction. Regular assessment of the tracheostomy site and appropriate management are essential.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, anoxic brain injury, who was admitted with hypoxia now resolving and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He recently had his tracheostomy tube replaced and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The family wishes to take him home on a ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as maintaining proper oral hygiene and elevating the head of bed.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs (DVT) which can potentially travel to the lungs causing a life-threatening PE. Prophylactic measures like heparin injections should be continued.

3. Hypertension: The patient is on home regimens of amlodipine and prazosin for hypertension. Monitoring blood pressure regularly and adjusting medications if needed is important to manage this condition.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level has resolved, but it's crucial to monitor it regularly, especially during the transition to home care, as hyperkalemia can have serious cardiac complications.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been in sinus rhythm with"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo M with h/o chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, anoxic
   brain injury admitted with hypoxia now resolving and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient with chronic respiratory
   failure at baseline with ABG on last admission 168/67/7.33. Increased
   peak inspiratory pressures and plateau pressures possible upper airway
   obstruction from either worsening tracheomalacia, trach malposition, or
   mucous plugging. Improved with suction (ABG 7.24/84/132 ->
   7.34/66/134), appears to be at respiratory baseline.  Bronch yesterday
   showed granulation tissue blocking trachea, which may intermittently
   cause episodes of respiratory distress.  IP plans to replace trach tube
   with new type which should cover this tissue.
   - IP replacement of trach tube
   - Continue nebs
   - D/C abx as no evidence of PNA
   - Suction PRN to avoid mucous plugging, being cautious not to
   manipulate tissue flap in a way that causes occlusion
   # Hypotension: Currently resolved. Unclear etiology and severity as no
   record of hypotension from rehab.
   - Restart anti-hypertensives for now as slightly hypertensive at this
   point with strict holding parameters (amlodipine thrice weekly (MWF),
   prazosin 1mg PO daily)
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   - recheck K on arrival to floor
   - Recheck EKG
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Has been in SR with rates 45-80.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - No anticoagulation given other comorbidities, he is not on AC at home
   .
   # Chronic foley [**2-12**] inoperable hernia:  per outside records on
   continuous bladder irrigation constantly, unclear why
   - foley catheter, monitor UOP
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Injury: Baseline 2.0-2.2. Currently at baseline.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitory lytes, creatinine.
   .
   # Type Two Diabetes:
   - Continue ISS
   - hold glipizide for now while working out TF recs
   - Monitor FSBS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and anoxic brain injury admitted with hypoxia now resolving and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's tracheostomy tube needs to be replaced due to granulation tissue blocking the trachea, which may intermittently cause episodes of respiratory distress. The patient has had episodes of hypotension, hyperkalemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic foley catheter with continuous bladder irrigation, and chronic kidney injury. The patient also has type two diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and tracheomalacia can lead to increased peak inspiratory pressures and plateau pressures, causing upper airway obstruction.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension, but the etiology and severity are unclear. It is important to monitor blood pressure closely.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient initially presented with hypoxia, which has now resolved. However, it is essential to maintain adequate oxygenation levels.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient had an episode of hyperkalemia, which has resolved. Close monitoring of potassium levels and EKG changes is necessary.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but has been in sinus rhythm with rates between 45-80. Monitoring on telemetry"
