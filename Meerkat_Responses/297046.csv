","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of variceal bleeding. The patient underwent emergent TIPS procedure, paracentesis with 2 L ascitic drainage, and placement of an arterial line at interventional radiology. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level has been stable overnight. The patient received 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to low platelets and fibrinogen levels, which may indicate mild disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) from liver failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and multi-lumen catheterization. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated maximum temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius. The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is at risk for encephalopathy post TIPS procedure. Lactulose has been restarted to prevent encephalopathy. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is on prophylactic antibiotics, deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and has a full code status. The patient's disposition is in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include further bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis, and respiratory complications due to prolonged mechanical ventilation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU for acute variceal bleeding. The patient underwent an emergent TIPS procedure, paracentesis with 2 L ascitic drainage, and placement of an arterial line at interventional radiology (IR). The patient also received one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) overnight due to low platelets and fibrinogen levels, possibly indicating mild disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) from liver failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/54 to 145/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on invasive ventilation, using a multi-lumen tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 0 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 35, and the plateau pressure is also 15 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated bilirubin, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and creatinine. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is an intubated individual with a chief complaint of variceal bleeding. They underwent emergent TIPS procedure, paracentesis with 2 L ascitic drainage, and placement of an arterial line at interventional radiology (IR). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been stable overnight, and they have received a unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to low platelets, low fibrinogen, and possible mild disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) from liver failure. The patient is on several medications including propofol, pantoprazole (Protonix), octreotide, and ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis. They also have a history of cirrhosis and are on NPO (nothing by mouth) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding from esophageal varices: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, and there is a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the underlying cause of portal hypertension is not adequately managed.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.
3. Infection: The patient is in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other infections.

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with a gastric variceal bleed. She underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 122/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She remains hemodynamically stable.

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly low hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, slightly elevated white blood cell count of 6.2 K/uL, and normal platelet count of 51 K/uL. Liver function tests are within normal limits, except for an elevated INR of 1.7. Other lab results, including electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose levels, are within normal ranges.

The patient has been receiving ceftriaxone for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. She is also receiving octreotide for variceal bleeding control.

   1.  Variceal Bleed:  s/p TIPS.  HCT stable overnight.  Continued
   hematochezia, suspect old bleeding.  Hemodynamically stable.
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis
   - Abd ultrasound in 1 week to assure TIPS patency
   - discuss with GI re: discontinuation of octreotide
   - Continue to follow HCT; transfuse PRBC and products as needed.
   - Platelets > 50k, INR < 1.8 or bleeding; cryo as needed.
   2.  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated for airway protection in setting of
   upper GI bleed.  Bleed is stable.
   - Passed SBT today, will extubate shortly.
   3.  Cirrhosis: s/p paracentesis x 2L

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure due to variceal bleeding. The patient underwent paracentesis and received a blood transfusion overnight. She is currently hemodynamically stable, with stable vital signs and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is intubated for airway protection but has passed a spontaneous breathing trial today and will likely be extubated soon. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal Bleed: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, and although the bleeding seems to have stopped, there is ongoing hematochezia, indicating that the bleeding may have occurred in the past. Continued monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin levels and hematocrit is necessary. Close observation for any signs of rebleeding is important, as variceal bleeding can be life-threatening.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to the upper gastrointestinal bleed. However, she has passed a spontaneous breathing trial and is expected to be extubated shortly. Monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress or difficulty breathing after extubation is crucial.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which increases the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose, a medication used to manage hep"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis and previous upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding. She was transferred to the hospital for management of UGI bleed due to esophageal varices and subsequently underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.

The patient presented with acute bleeding from gastric varices, which required urgent TIPS procedures by interventional radiology (IR). Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped to a nadir of 24, and she received at least three blood transfusions at the outside hospital, with no further transfusions given in the current facility. Her Hct has remained stable overnight.

The patient is currently receiving IV pantoprazole, which is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and octreotide has been stopped per hepatology recommendations. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/42 to 158/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is extubated and breathing spontaneously, with a tidal volume of 401 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 6 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits, and her oxygen delivery device is a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is easily arousable, alert, and oriented x3, with no evidence of mucus or gastrointestinal bleeding. Her abdomen is soft, with mild distension and bowel sounds present. There is no evidence of edema or other abnormalities on the extremities.

Laboratory results show stable hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, with slight fluctuations over the past few days. Liver function tests indicate elevated levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes, while kidney function is within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are also within normal ranges.

The patient has a history of esophageal varices and gastric varices, which acutely bled. She underwent TIPS procedures and has received multiple blood transfusions. Her current assessment includes the following potential medical complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: This is likely due to liver disease, which can cause mixed coagulopathy. There is also a possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to liver disease, given the elevated prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), along with low platelet count and low fibrinogen levels.

2. Cirrhosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of ETOH cirrhosis and previous upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding. She was transferred to the ICU for management of acute UGI bleed due to gastric varices. The patient underwent an urgent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) was at a nadir of 24 during the procedure but has been stable since admission. She received at least three blood transfusions at the outside hospital and no transfusions in the current hospital. The patient's platelet count has been stable since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and underwent a TIPS procedure, which can increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. It is important to monitor her mental status and continue lactulose therapy to prevent encephalopathy.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or elevated white blood cell count, is essential.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia likely due to liver disease. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters, including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute bleeding due to gastric varices. The patient has a history of esophageal varices and cirrhosis. On admission, the patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level was at a nadir of 24, indicating significant blood loss. The patient received at least three units of blood transfusion at the outside hospital (OSH). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 108/42 to 158/68 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 915 mL and output of 2,580 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,665 mL. The patient is receiving pantoprazole infusion and other ICU medications. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated and sedated, with PERRLA (pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation), MMM (mouth mucosa moist and moist), RRR (regular rate and rhythm) with S1/S2 heart sounds, ventilated breath sounds in the lungs, soft abdomen with no blood stasis, and no edema in the"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who presented with a variceal bleed and has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/55 mmHg to 108/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is extubated and awake, following commands. 

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, white blood cell count of 5.9 K/uL, platelet count of 51 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and liver enzymes within normal range. Other lab values are provided in the note.

The patient's assessment includes gastrointestinal bleeding post-TIPS, resolved respiratory failure, and cirrhosis. The plan is to continue with close monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin levels, change protonix to IV bid, and administer ceftriaxone for one week. Lactulose will be given for cirrhosis management, and a RUQ ultrasound will be performed at 5-7 days post-TIPS.

In terms of ICU care, the patient will receive advanced nutrition as tolerated, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and discontinuation of femoral and arterial lines. Prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and vigilance against ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) since the patient is not intubated. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is transfer to the floor."

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with cirrhosis, admitted with a variceal bleed and now post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. The patient's current condition is stable, with no evidence of rebleeding and remaining extubated. The vital signs are within normal limits, including temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is awake, alert, and in no acute distress. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and normal neurologic status.

The laboratory results show stable hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, with a slight decrease in platelet count. Liver enzymes such as ALT and AST are within normal range. Electrolyte levels are also within normal limits. Imaging studies have been performed, but the results are not provided in the note.

The patient's plan includes transferring to the floor, continuing with lactulose for cirrhosis management, and monitoring the TIPS procedure. The patient will be on a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and advanced nutrition as tolerated. Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, infections, and respiratory problems."
