","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, presenting to the ICU with altered mental status, suspected intoxication, and high ethanol levels. The patient experienced a fever spike to 102.4Â°F, and persistent febrile state since 12pm. He was started on fosphenytoin for seizure disorder and developed back pain, leading to consideration of an epidural abscess. The patient's platelets are trending down, and he has low Hct and leukopenia. He also has a facial lac, repaired in the ED, and is unable to assess ligamentous neck trauma due to profound intoxication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is on fosphenytoin for it. Regular monitoring of seizure activity and phenytoin levels is necessary.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
3. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and recent spike suggest a possible ongoing infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelets are trending down, indicating possible thrombocytopenia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Possible epidural abscess: The patient's"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, presenting to the emergency department after being found intoxicated on the street. The patient's current condition includes a high temperature (102.4), persistent fevers since 12 pm, back pain, low white blood cell count (1.4), and low platelet count (119). The patient is also experiencing altered mental status and has difficulty cooperating with neuro exams. 

The patient has been started on fosphenytoin for seizure disorder, vancomycin and cefepime for broad-spectrum coverage, and diazepam (Valium) for agitation. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and EKG have been done, but results are pending. 

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and EtOH abuse. The patient's lab results show an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), low platelet count (Plt), and normal creatinine (Cr) level. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, with slightly low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++) levels. 

The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (HR), low blood pressure (BP), normal respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. 

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, and the neurologic examination is difficult to assess due to the patient's agitation and uncooperativeness. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever, back pain, and recent facial lacertion. The patient's flow sheet data shows an increased intake of fluids and outputs, including urine output. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers, despite antibiotic treatment, suggest a possible ongoing infection. The low white blood cell count may indicate leukopenia, which can be a sign of infection.
2. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and the use of fosphenytoin indicates an ongoing concern for seizures.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and current symptoms may suggest alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to seizures, delirium tremens (DTs), and other complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count (Plt) may indicate thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (BP) may require further investigation and management to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition, obtain additional diagnostic tests, and provide appropriate interventions to manage these potential complications and improve the patient's overall health status."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and suspected bipolar disorder.
- He presented to the emergency department after being found intoxicated on the street.
- The patient has high levels of ethanol in his blood, suggesting exceedingly high levels when found on the street.
- There is a concern for ingestion of a secondary substance, but serum osmolar gap is consistent with the degree of ethanol ingestion.
- The patient has altered mental status, but it is not consistent with delirium tremens (DTs) or seizures.
- He has a history of seizure disorder and was given IV thiamine, folate, and B12.
- The patient's temperature spiked overnight, reaching 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and he was pancultured.
- Blood and urine cultures are pending.
- The patient's platelet count is trending down, and he has low hemoglobin (Hct) and leukopenia.
- He underwent facial laceration repair in the ED and received a tetanus shot.
- The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and was started on Phosphenytoin for seizure disorder.
- He is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source and appropriate treatment.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and recent reduction in alcohol"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse and possible bipolar disorder. He presented to the emergency department after being found intoxicated on the street. The patient's condition includes intoxication, altered mental status, and a high level of ethanol in his blood. There is concern for the ingestion of a secondary substance, but serum osmolar gap is within the expected range for the degree of ethanol ingestion. The patient has a history of seizure disorder and may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

Medical Complications:
1. Intoxication: The patient has a high level of ethanol in his blood, suggesting exceedingly high levels when found on the street. This can lead to altered mental status and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and current symptoms, there is a concern for alcohol withdrawal, which can include seizures, tremors, hallucinations, and delirium tremens (DTs).
3. Infection: The patient has a fever and growing gram-negative rods in his blood cultures. This indicates a potential bacterial infection that needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Possible causes include infection, alcohol suppression, or medications.
5. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is currently on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, withdrawal seizures, and possible bipolar disorder. He was brought to the emergency department by EMS after being found intoxicated on the street in fair condition. The patient has shown improvement since admission, with stable vital signs and no acute distress. However, he has several medical complications that require attention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is low, indicating a possible infection. Blood cultures have been negative so far, but further monitoring is needed. The presence of GPRs in the blood culture suggests a possible diphtheroid contamination, but true infection should still be monitored.
2. Leukopenia: The patient's leukocyte count is also low, which may be due to infection, EtOH suppression, or medication effect (phenytoin). Neutropenic precautions should be initiated, and the patient should be monitored closely.
3. Spinal abnormality: The patient's lower extremity weakness and hyperreflexia could be attributed to a spinal abnormality. However, a CT of the lumbar spine did not reveal any spinal abnormalities or infectious focus.
4. EtOH withdrawal: The patient is at risk for complications related to alcohol withdrawal, such as seizures and delirium tremens. CIWA protocol with Valium should be initiated to manage withdrawal symptoms.
5. Thiamine deficiency: Given the patient's history of EtOH abuse"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, bipolar disorder, and withdrawal seizures. He was found intoxicated on the street and brought to the emergency department. He has been in the ICU since admission and is currently on several medications including thiamine, folate, nicotine patch, Dilantin, and lidocaine patch.

24-hour events include requiring only 10 mg of Valium yesterday. His allergies are significant for sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), unknown allergies to Keppra (oral levetiracetam), and psychosis. The patient received vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics on 02/25.

Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/63 to 126/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,660 mL, output of 2,405 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 745 mL. Respiratory support is not required, and the patient's ABG values are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular findings, clear breath sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, soft non-tender abdomen, and attentive neurologic status with increased tone and hyperreflexia.
