   This is a 58 yo male with history of morbid obesity, s/p gastric
   bypass, h/o DVT presenting with massive hemoptysis and found to have
   bilateral PEs.
   .
   # Massive Hemoptysis / PEs:  due to agitation unable to have a
   spontaneous breathing trial.  Continue to monitor hct and for further
   bleeding.
   -f/u antibodies to evaluate for vasculitis
   -holding aspirin
   -s/p IVC filter, no anticoagulation given massive hemoptysis
   - ECHO today to look for RH strain
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection.  Extubation
   largely limited by agitation.
   - diurese as tolerated
   - anxiolytics for extubation
   - scheduled MDI
   # HTN: Was HTN overnight. Was started on lisinopril as patient has DM2
   and fear of flash pulm edema when extubated.
   - hold lisinopril for now given attempted diuresis today
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Fever / bandemia: continue to f/u blood and sputum cultures.
   -treat w/ cefepime vanco given bandemia and fever, although more likely
   related to massive hemoptysis and pulmonary infarction related to Pess
   - narrow abx today to vanco and
   # Chronic Pain:
   -continue methadone
   # DM II: SSI.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, previous gastric bypass surgery, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presented with massive hemoptysis and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs). 

The patient's recent events include fever, elevated blood pressure, hemoptysis, and a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). He started taking lisinopril but is currently on hold due to attempted diuresis. The patient also required several boluses of propofol overnight for agitation during cleaning and subsequently became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 80-90 and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 52-60. The propofol infusion rate was decreased from 50 to 30 mcg/kg/min, and he was given 250 cc normal saline (NS) twice.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He received antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. His current infusions include propofol at 40 mcg/kg/min, famotidine (Pepcid), fentanyl, and lasix.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate (HR) of 80 beats per minute, SBP of 103/56 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. His weight is currently 122 kg, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,529 mL and a total output of 1,915 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 614 mL.

The patient is intubated and sedated, with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 36, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 8 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 180 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 12 L/min.

Physical examination reveals an intubated, sedated, obese male with normal heart sounds, clear lung exam, mildly distended abdomen, warm extremities, and no edema. Neurological examination shows sedation and movement of limbs.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.3 thousand/mm³, slightly elevated hemoglobin (Hct) of 34.8%, normal platelet count (Plt) of 122 thousand/mm³, and normal kidney function with a creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits or do not significantly impact the patient's current condition.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension, chronic pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hemoptysis, and pulmonary embolism (PE). He is expected to have further bleeding monitoring, evaluation for vasculitis antibodies, and an echocardiogram (ECHO) to look for right heart strain. Respiratory failure is being managed with intubation due to airway protection, and extubation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, hemoptysis, and a history of diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and he has been started on lisinopril. Overnight, the patient required several boluses of propofol for agitation during cleaning and subsequently became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 80-90 and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 52-60. Propofol infusion rate was decreased, and the patient was given two boluses of normal saline (NS). The patient has no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's current hypotension could be due to the use of propofol, which can cause vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's fluid status and consider adjusting the propofol infusion rate or discontinuing it if necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature, along with his recent infections, raises concern for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is necessary to assess the progression of sepsis and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms of hemoptysis and acute onset of symptoms may indicate a possible PE"

1. Massive Hemoptysis / PEs: The patient is being monitored for any signs of recurrence. He is holding aspirin and has undergone an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement without anticoagulation due to the massive hemoptysis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated with stable respiratory status.
3. HTN: The patient's blood pressure has improved since starting lisinopril.
4. Fever / bandemia: The patient had a low-grade fever yesterday. Sputum gram stain showed the presence of gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and gram-negative rods (GNRs). Blood and sputum cultures are being continued to monitor for any infections.
5. Chronic Pain: The patient is on methadone for chronic pain management.
6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) continues to trend down. He will be monitored for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, and active treatment for anemia will be pursued.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, previous gastric bypass surgery, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presented with massive hemoptysis and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions.

The patient successfully underwent extubation and is currently breathing on his own with the assistance of a nasal cannula. He is experiencing right trapezius pain and numbness in his fingertips, but he is refusing a neck CT scan.

The patient's ECHO shows moderate right ventricular (RV) dilation and moderate RV hypokinesis. His hemoglobin concentration (Hct) remains stable, and he has been taken off cefepime, switching to vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. The patient received 40mg of IV lasix, resulting in brisk diuresis. Seroquel has been discontinued, and the patient has been ordered percocet for pain management.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were cefepime on 03/13/2161 at 12:08 AM, vancomycin on 03/13/2161 at 08:02 AM, and ciprofloxacin on 03/14/2161 at 02:26 AM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate (HR) of 74 bpm (70-105 bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 149/62mmHg to 182/79mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute (19-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 122 kg, and his height is 71 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is at 10 mmHg (4-12 mmHg). Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,149 mL and output of 6,200 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -4,051 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), and slightly elevated platelet count (Plt).

The patient's imaging studies reveal right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis on the ECHO. There is no definite valvular dysfunction identified, and compared to the prior study, the right ventricular cavity is now smaller, and free wall motion is slightly improved.

Assessment and plan:
1. Massive Hemoptysis / PEs: The patient successfully extubated, no additional bleeding. ECHO shows improved RV dilation and hypokinesis.
- Follow-up antibodies to evaluate for vasculitis.
- Holding aspirin.
- Status post inferior vena cava"
