   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Maybe
   meningitis, although LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG today to rule out subclinical seizures
   - MRI to rule out stroke
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever today, culturing, is immunecompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia
   with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Not covering ESBLs.  Also
   not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - consider DVT as source of fever, f/u LENIs
   - hemodynamically stable, does not appear septic
   .
   # RUQ pain - unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy so not
   gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v. colitis vs.
   pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likley in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - start dilt gtt, transition to PO if GI access achieved
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**] (today).  Culture data
   only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic
   but oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**])
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR and CTA without changes, still with RLL PNA
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission. Unclear etiology to
   CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr 1.2 up from 1.1 yesterday (high was 1.3 this admission)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for AMS, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no SQ hep d/t SDH), PPI, pneumovax given at
   OSH
   .
   # Access: PICC line

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, frequent falls, severe peripheral neuropathy, acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and pneumonia following an unwitnessed fall. She was transferred back to the MICU after becoming non-responsive, febrile, and in atrial fibrillation. The patient has known pneumonia and is immunocompromised due to pulse steroids for MM. She is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AMS (Altered Mental Status) - unclear etiology, possible causes include infection, drug effects, or delirium due to pain.
2. Fever - possible causes include infection, especially given her immunocompromised state, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
3. RUQ pain - unclear etiology, could be due to gallbladder pain, rib fracture, pleural pain, colitis, or pneumonia pain.
4. Subdural hematoma - requires neurosurgical follow-up, no acute change from OSH imaging, and no changes in CT today.
5. Atrial fibrillation - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of fever and new infection.
6. Respiratory/Pneumonia - known pneumonia on chest X-ray, treated with vancomycin and cefepime. Culture data only positive for Gram-positive cocci in sputum.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Could be secondary to infection as patient is
   febrile.  Has known pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad
   spectrum abx.  Could be drug effect, although not on any sedating meds
   now except oxybutinin.  Is hemodynamically stable and should have
   adequate perfusion to brain.  Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   .
   # Fever - fever today, culturing, is immunecompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia
   with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Not covering ESBLs.  Also
   not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
   - consider DVT as source of fever, f/u LENIs
   - hemodynamically stable, does not appear septic
   .
   # RUQ pain - unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy so not
   gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v. colitis.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
   - consider abx
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - q4H neuro checks overnight
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.3, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin; was also on pregabalin but floor team was consider
   stopping it - will follow up with neuro recs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likley in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - start dilt gtt
   - echo in AM, TSH (of note had echo initially in hospitalization as
   part of syncope workup which was unrevealing except for pulm HTN)
   - consider CTA to r/o PE as cause of new afib
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   - trend CEs to rule out ischemia, although unlikely cause
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**] (today).  Culture data
   only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic
   but oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**])
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR to look for new, changing infiltrates; pleural effusions or other
   lung changes.
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, severe peripheral neuropathy, and frequent falls. She presents with acute on chronic subdural hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall. The patient was transferred back to the MICU due to becoming non-responsive, febrile, and developing atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AMS (Altered Mental Status) - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH (subdural hematoma). Monitoring CTs for changes as needed. Could be secondary to infection as the patient is febrile. Could be drug effect, although not on any sedating medications now except oxybutinin. Is hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to the brain.
2. Fever - fever today, culturing, is immunocompromised secondary to pulse steroids for MM (multiple myeloma). Being treated for HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia) and aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl). Not covering ESBLs (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria) or fungal infections. Follow-up cultures, continue current antibiotics, consider DVT (deep vein thrombosis) as a source of fever, follow-up LENIs (lower extremity ultrasounds).

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old woman admitted to the MICU with subdural hematoma (SDH) after a fall. She was also diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and has a chest X-ray showing an infiltrate. The patient presented with poor mentation, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, fever, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib RVR). She was started on a diltiazem drip, which lowered her heart rate from 140s to 100s but did not respond to lopressor. RUQ ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography (CT) were negative for any abnormalities. Lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds (LENS) were negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Lumbar puncture results were negative for meningitis. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed no pulmonary embolism but revealed right lower lobe pneumonia and possible pyelonephritis.

The patient's allergies are unchanged from admission. She is currently receiving diltiazem intravenously at a rate of 10 mg/hour, along with other medications such as ditropan, lyrica, dilantin, cefepime, and acetylcysteine.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for the mentioned conditions. Her vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.3"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Maybe
   meningitis, although LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG today to rule out subclinical seizures
   - MRI to rule out stroke
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever today, culturing, is immunecompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia
   with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Not covering ESBLs.  Also
   not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - consider DVT as source of fever, f/u LENIs
   - hemodynamically stable, does not appear septic
   .
   # RUQ pain - unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy so not
   gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v. colitis vs.
   pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likley in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - start dilt gtt, transition to PO if GI access achieved
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**] (today).  Culture data
   only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic
   but oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**])
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR and CTA without changes, still with RLL PNA
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission. Unclear etiology to
   CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr 1.2 up from 1.1 yesterday (high was 1.3 this admission)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for AMS, replete lytes PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old individual with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's preliminary EEG shows diffuse encephalopathy, and the MRI reveals a stable hematoma and chronic microvascular infarct but no acute changes. The patient has been transitioned from dilatant infusion to oral administration. The family is in agreement with the feeding tube, but the patient is unable to cooperate with the procedure, so an IR placement has been ordered. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin and cefepime. The patient is currently receiving infusions of diltiazem, furosemide, and lorazepam. Other medications include dilantin and metoprolol.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 beats per minute with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 116/66 to 158/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are noted. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination were not assessed.

Lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.4 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 22.2%, platelet count of 76 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, glucose level of 143 mg/dL, and troponin T level of 0.04 ng/mL. Other lab values such as PT, PTT, INR, CK, CKMB, ALT, AST, and electrolyte levels are also provided.

The patient has been diagnosed with anemia secondary to blood loss, abdominal pain, fever, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and has multiple lines including a PICC line and two peripheral IV lines. The patient is on ICU care with nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status and is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Less
   likely meningitis, LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG
 prelim read is normal
   - MRI to r/o CVA
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever again today, culturing, is immunocompromised secondary
   to pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime,.  Not covering ESBLs.
   Also not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - transitioned to PO dilt today, as NGT in place
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**]. Culture data only
   positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic but
   oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR stable
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21, rcv

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma who has been admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic subdural hematoma, pneumonia, and is currently non-responsive. The patient is febrile and in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute on chronic subdural hematoma: The patient has a history of falls and severe peripheral neuropathy, which may have contributed to the development of a subdural hematoma. This condition can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological decline if not managed appropriately.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has known pneumonia, which is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and cefepime. This infection needs to be closely monitored, and culture results are pending. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration.

3. Fever: The patient has had recurrent fevers, and cultures have been obtained to identify the cause. In an immunocompromised patient such as this one, due to pulse steroids for multiple myeloma, fever could indicate an ongoing infection or other underlying condition.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, likely secondary to the recent infection. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are relatively stable, but close monitoring is necessary. The patient's cardiac status should be assessed regularly, and antico"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The preliminary EEG and MRI results show diffuse encephalopathy, stable hematoma, chronic microvascular infarct, but no acute changes. The patient has been transitioned from intravenous diliazem to oral diliazem. The family is okay with feeding tube placement, but the patient has been unable to cooperate with the procedure, so an order for IR placement has been made. The HSV PCR from LP is pending, and all other results are unremarkable.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They have received doses of vancomycin and cefepime on 04/03/2157. They are currently on various infusions, including diltiazem at 15 mg/hour, furosemide (Lasix), lorazepam (Ativan), and dilantin. Other medications include metoprolol.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Flow sheet data as of 04/04/2157 05:55 AM shows vital signs with a maximum temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), current temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate ranging from 91-121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75/103-158/82 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 22-43 breaths per"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Maybe
   meningitis, although LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG today to rule out subclinical seizures
   - MRI to rule out stroke
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever today, culturing, is immunecompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration pneumonia
   with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Not covering ESBLs.  Also
   not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - consider DVT as source of fever, f/u LENIs
   - hemodynamically stable, does not appear septic
   .
   # RUQ pain - unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy so not
   gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v. colitis vs.
   pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likley in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - start dilt gtt, transition to PO if GI access achieved
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**] (today).  Culture data
   only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic
   but oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**])
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR and CTA without changes, still with RLL PNA
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission. Unclear etiology to

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, recent falls, severe peripheral neuropathy, and acute on chronic subdural hematoma. She presented with fever, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation. She has known pneumonia and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's recent MRI showed a stable hematoma and a chronic microvascular infarct but no acute changes. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/66 mmHg to 158/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, thrombocytopenia, and hyponatremia. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin build, black left eye, crackles in the chest, soft abdomen with tenderness in the right upper quadrant, absent peripheral pulses, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows non-purposeful movement and non-responsiveness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and fever could be indicative of delirium, which is common in older adults, especially those with underlying medical conditions.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and known pneumonia suggest a possible ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of a stroke. The MRI showed small superficial cortical, acute on subacute areas of likely embolic stroke in the right temporal and right frontal lobes, with no hemorrhagic conversion. The patient is currently receiving diltiazem infusion at 5 mg/hr, pantoprazole, dilantin, and other medications. 

24-hour events include starting diltiazem at 60 mg QID, which was increased to 90 mg QID and being weaned off Dilt gtt (at 5mg/hr as of 6 am). The patient has been on vancomycin and cefepime. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 102 bpm (81-112), blood pressure ranging from 140/81 mmHg to 142/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute (22-35), oxygen saturation of 95%, and atrial fibrillation.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Year (4 digits) 1978**].
   .
   # AMS - unclear etiology, CT of head negative for change in SDH and
   patient moving all 4 extremities.  Would continue to monitor CTs for
   changes as needed.  Neuro consult, checking dilantin levels and EEG.
   Could be secondary to infection as patient is febrile.  Has known
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Less
   likely meningitis, LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect,
   although not on any sedating meds now except oxybutinin.  Is
   hemodynamically stable and should have adequate perfusion to brain.
   Recent MRI showed nonobstruction flow.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
   - f/u LP cultures
   - EEG
 prelim read is normal
   - MRI to r/o CVA
   - LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - hold oxybutinin
   - follow up neuro recs
   - could be delirium in setting of pain
   .
   # Fever - fever again today, culturing, is immunocompromised secondary
   to pulse steroids for MM.  Being treated for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime,.  Not covering ESBLs.
   Also not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
   - continue current abx
 see if infection declares itself
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in CT today.
   - transfuse plt's with goal of >80, plt 96 now
   - INR 1.5, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; holding lyrica
   is in setting of no POs
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; IV dilt pushes work.
   - transitioned to PO dilt today, as NGT in place
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Has known PNA on CXR, treated from the start.  Abx
   treatment included vanco and cefepime started [**3-29**].  Did get one dose
   of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for atypical coverage on [**3-29**]
   which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started [**4-2**]. Culture data only
   positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation done.  Is tachypneic but
   oxygentating well.
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime for 7 days (until [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - CXR stable
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall.
   - tele
   - MRA of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   - monitor resp status
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with goal > 80K
   - Transfuse hct < 21, rcv
d one unit [**2157-4-4**] in AM
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission. Unclear etiology to
   CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr stable at 1.1
   .
   # FEN: NPO for AMS, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no SQ hep d/t SDH), PPI, pneumovax given at
   OSH
   .
   # Access: PICC line
   .
   # Code: Ok to intubate, patient declines resuscitation but son who is
   HCP says yes to intubation.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 82-year-old female with multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls, severe peripheral neuropathy, acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and pneumonia.
- She was transferred back to the MICU after becoming non-responsive, febrile, and in atrial fibrillation.
- The patient has known pneumonia and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime). She is also immunocompromised due to pulse steroids for multiple myeloma.
- She has a history of falls, and it is unclear if she experienced a loss of consciousness during one of the falls.
- The patient has pancytopenia related to myeloma and renal failure at baseline from the last admission.
- She has a small superficial cortical, acute on subacute area of likely embolic stroke in the right temporal and frontal lobes.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 102 bpm (81-112 bpm), blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg (93/60-142/98 mmHg), respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute (22-35 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is febrile and has known pneumonia. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but her immunocompromised state increases the risk of further infections.
2. Stroke: The patient has a small superficial cortical, acute on subacute area of likely embolic stroke in the right temporal and frontal lobes. This increases the risk of neurological complications and potential worsening of her condition.
3. Delirium: The patient is nonverbal and has a decreased level of consciousness. Delirium could be a result of various factors such as infection, medication effects, or due to the underlying medical conditions.
4. Bleeding: The patient has an acute on chronic subdural hematoma, which increases the risk of bleeding and potential neurological deterioration.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or hemodynamic instability.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   patient moving all 4 extremities. 24 hour EEG showing spikes that might
   represent subacute status epilepticus. Could be secondary to infection
   as patient is febrile and has known pneumonia.  MRI shows acute and
   subacute infarcts c/w infarcts, no hemorrhagic conversion, which has
   potential to contribute to the AMS. Recent MRI showed nonobstruction
   flow. [**Month (only) 8**] be c.diff in the setting of broad spectrum abx.  Less likely
   meningitis, LP initially negative.  Could be drug effect, although not

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls, and severe peripheral neuropathy. She presented with acute on chronic subdural hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall. The patient was transferred back to the MICU due to becoming non-responsive, febrile, and developing atrial fibrillation. She has been diagnosed with status epilepticus, fever, pneumonia, and a possible urinary tract infection. The patient's condition is complicated by pancytopenia, renal failure, and a history of falls with unclear etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and fluctuating levels of consciousness may indicate delirium, which can be caused by infections, medications, or metabolic disturbances.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection in the lungs, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and respiratory failure if not properly treated.
3. Seizures: The patient has been diagnosed with status epilepticus, indicating a continuous seizure activity. This can result in further neurological damage if not promptly managed.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient has risk factors for blood clots, such as immobility and pancytopenia, which can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, frequent falls, severe peripheral neuropathy, acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU after becoming non-responsive, febrile, and experiencing atrial fibrillation. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including altered mental status (AMS), fever, right upper quadrant pain, subdural hematoma, atrial fibrillation, respiratory pneumonia, diarrhea, falls/syncope, myeloma, pancytopenia, renal failure, and femoral nerve dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's febrile state and known pneumonia indicate a potential ongoing infection that needs to be closely monitored and treated.
2. Seizure: The 24-hour EEG showing variable duration spikes suggests the possibility of subacute status epilepticus. Phenytoin was bolused, and dilantin is being continued at an appropriately corrected level to prevent further seizures.
3. Bleeding: Although the patient's platelet count is low (30,000), there is no evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head. However, it is essential to monitor the patient closely for any signs of bleeding, especially considering the subdural hematoma.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status needs continuous monitoring due to pneumonia and the need to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
5. Renal failure:"

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls, severe peripheral neuropathy, acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and pneumonia. She was transferred back to the MICU after becoming non-responsive, febrile, and in atrial fibrillation. The patient has multiple medical complications including AMS (altered mental status) likely secondary to seizure activity, fever, oliguria (low urine output), RUQ pain, subdural hematoma, atrial fibrillation, respiratory pneumonia, diarrhea, falls/syncope, myeloma, pancytopenia (low blood cell counts), renal failure, and FEN (fluid and electrolyte imbalance).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient's altered mental status may be due to seizure activity, as indicated by the presence of variable duration spikes on EEG.
2. Subdural hematoma: The patient has an acute on chronic subdural hematoma, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deficits.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can progress to respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
4. Oliguria: The patient's low urine output may indicate acute kidney injury or dehydration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has received transfusions of platelets, antibiotics, and other medications. The patient's vital signs show fever, increased heart rate, and decreased blood pressure. The patient is also experiencing tachypnea and increased oxygen requirement, leading to increased fluid on the right side. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH level of 7.41, PaCO2 of 47, HCO3 of 136, and lactate level of 1.0. The patient's physical examination reveals atrial fibrillation, but no other significant findings. Lab results show an elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has been diagnosed with acute anemia secondary to blood loss, abdominal pain, fever, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's increased oxygen requirement and decreased PaO2/FiO2 ratio may indicate respiratory distress, putting them at"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1978**].
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 Likely secondary to seizure activity.  MRI showed
   acute on subacute embolic infarcts, which is likely contributing, in
   addition to SDH. LP cultures negative, which speaks against meningitis.
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 continue to be negative
   - EEG -continuing epileptiform activity, but improved
   - Neuro
 start Ativan on top of Dilantin and Lyrica; dilantin level
   still low, will f/u with Neuro
   - Change Dilantin to fosphenytoin so PICC line obstruction will not
   recur
   - D/c Oxybutinin as anticholineric effects may contribute to AMS, will
   not need as pt has Foley
   .
   # Fever
 Following fever curve, is immunocompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Finished treatment for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime ([**4-5**]).  Did not cover
   with ESBLs or antifungals.  LENIs and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u cultures
 so far negative
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   - Spiked T on [**2157-4-6**], pan cultured, U/A pos for WBC, LE, Bact ->
   restarted vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Oliguria
 Had UOP in 20s-30s over first few days. Patient appears to
   be volume up on exam.  Attempted to take off fluid
   - Was given Lasix x2 on [**4-11**] with UOP to 200-300/hr, however Cr incr
   from 1.2 to 1.5
   - Will hold Lasix until infection clears
   - Follow UOP
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain. Abdominal ultrasound
 negative. CT abd and
   pelvis did not show pathology which could account for pain; consider
   possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be well visualized
   on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH
   imaging, no changes in repeat CT
   - original plan was to transfuse plt's with goal of >80, but pt has no
   evidence of bleeding on recent MRI head, will hold off for now, unless
   NS has different indication
   - INR 1.4, s/p Vit K treatment
   - continue dilantin at an appropriately corrected level; restarted
   lyrica as patient has NGT
   -F/u with NSurg if repeat imaging needed
   .
   # Afib with [**Name (NI) 1978**] - unclear precipitating factor, likely in setting of
   fever and new infection.  BPs stable, HRs to 140s.  Not changed with
   metoprolol; responsive to diltiazem
   - Titrating dilt po dose per pharmacy recs
   - echo done earlier in admission, no need to repeat at this time
   - no PE based on CTA
   - EKG without signs of ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory/PNA: Abx treatment included vanco and cefepime started
   [**3-29**].  Did get one dose of ceftriaxone.  Was started on levo for
   atypical coverage on [**3-29**] which was stopped [**4-2**].  Flagyl was started
   [**4-2**]. Culture data only positive for GPCs in sputum, no speciation
   done.  Needed incr O2 on [**2157-4-6**], CXR showed incr patchiness on R>L c/w
   probable aspiration pneumonitis and probable fluid overload. Finished 7
   day course of  vancomycin, cefepime (stopped [**4-5**]) , flagyl d/c
   - oxygen to maintain sats >92%
   - F/u CXR, [**2157-4-7**], some improvement after Lasix and O2 requirement down
   to FiO2 35%
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Diarrhea: patient had an episode of diarrhea on [**2157-4-4**]
   - C. diff negative x1
   - F/u 2^nd C diff
   .
   # Falls/?Syncope: recent admit with extensive work-up attributing LE
   weakness and falls to cervical spondylosis and multilevel degenerative
   disease with myelopathy and neuropathy. Unclear if LOC with fall. MRA
   of neck done on last admit showing no flow limiting lesions
   - Cont. tele  and monitor resp status
   - dilantin as above for seizure ppx
   .
   # Myeloma: On pulse decadron as per heme-onc for tx of myeloma.
   - Next pulse due in 1 week.
   - will touch base with heme onc about next steroid dose
   .
   # Pancytopenia: [**3-7**] to myeloma.
   - Transfuse platelets with absolute goal > 50K; transfused 1U [**4-6**]
   - Transfuse hct < 21, rcv
d one unit [**2157-4-4**] in AM
   .
   # Renal Failure: At baseline from last admission: 1.1-1.2. Unclear
   etiology to CKD, but may represent complication from myeloma.
   - Trend Cr
   - Cr incr after Lasix x2
   .
   # FEN: NGT TF at goal, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots (no SQ hep d/t SDH), PPI, pneumovax given at
   OSH

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, recent falls, severe peripheral neuropathy, and acute on chronic subdural hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall. She was transferred back to the MICU after becoming non-responsive, febrile, and in atrial fibrillation. The patient is immunocompromised secondary to pulse steroids for MM. She finished treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia with broad-spectrum vancomycin and cefepime. The patient's fever curve is following, but she remains hemodynamically stable. She was restarted on vancomycin and Zosyn due to positive urine analysis (WBC, LE, bacteria) and elevated temperature. 

The patient has a history of oliguria, with urine output in the 20s-30s over the first few days. She appears to be volume overloaded on examination. Furosemide (Lasix) was given twice on [**4-11**], but her creatinine increased from 1.2 to 1.5. Lasix will be held until infection clears. 

The patient also experiences RUQ pain, which is stable but unclear etiology. She is post-cholecystectomy, so it is not gallbladder pain. It could be rib fracture, pleural pain, colitis, or pneumonia pain. An abdominal ultrasound was negative, and CT abdomen and pelvis did not"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing several health issues.

The patient's chief complaint includes altered mental status, fever, and abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea, elevated JVP, and low blood pressure. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated lactate levels, renal failure, and other abnormalities in electrolyte levels and liver function tests. The patient's platelet count is low, and there is evidence of infection with positive urine analysis for bacteria and yeast. 

The patient has received various treatments including antibiotics, transfusion of platelets, and diuresis. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an aerosol-cool device.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening renal failure, development of sepsis due to ongoing infection, further decline in mental status, and potential bleeding due to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important for the patient's healthcare team to closely monitor and manage these conditions to prevent any potential complications and improve the patient's overall health status."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 y/o F w/ multiple myeloma, frequent recent falls in setting of
   severe peripheral neuropathy who now p/w acute on chronic subdural
   hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall.  Transferred back to
   MICU after becoming non responsive, febrile and in afib with [**Telephone/Fax (3) 1978**].
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 Likely secondary to seizure activity.  CT of head
   negative for change in SDH and patient moving all 4 extremities. LENIs
   and CTA neg for clots
   - f/u pan cultures of blood, urine, stool
 so far negative
   - f/u LP cultures
 Neg prelim, neg Crypto
   - EEG
 f/u final read
   - Neuro
 start Ativan on top of Dilantin and Lyrica; dilantin level
   still low, will f/u with neuron; may take patient to Neuro step-down
   .
   # Fever
 Following fever curve, is immunocompromised secondary to
   pulse steroids for MM.  Finished treatment for HAP and aspiration
   pneumonia with broad spectrum vanco, cefepime ([**4-5**]).  Not covering
   ESBLs.  Also not covering fungal infections.
   - f/u cultures
 so far negative
   - remains hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Oliguria
 Patient appears to be volume up on exam.  Was bolused
   yesterday.  Will give lasix for diuresis today.
   .
   # RUQ pain
 stable, unclear etiology, patient is post cholecystectomy
   so not gallbladder pain.  Could be rib fracture v. pleural pain v.
   colitis vs. pneumonia pain.
   - f/u abdominal ultrasound
 negative
   - CT abd and pelvis did not show pathology which could account for
   pain; consider possible obstructing stone as cause as it would not be
   well visualized on CT
   - no abx for now
   .
   # Subdural Hematoma: Neurosurgery following, no acute change from OSH

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma, who presented with acute on chronic subdural hematoma and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall. She was initially unresponsive, febrile, and in atrial fibrillation. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient is likely experiencing encephalopathy secondary to seizure activity. EEG results show epileptiform activity, and the patient is being treated with antiepileptic medications.

2. Fever: The patient has a fever, which is likely due to an underlying infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but further cultures are pending to identify the causative organism.

3. Oliguria: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, as indicated by her physical examination findings. She has been given lasix for diuresis.

4. RUQ pain: The patient is experiencing right upper quadrant pain, which could be due to various causes such as rib fracture, pleural pain, colitis, or pneumonia. Further investigations are needed to determine the underlying cause.

5. Subdural hematoma: The patient has a subdural hematoma, which is being managed conservatively at present. Repeat imaging has shown no change, and the plan is to continue monitoring without surgical intervention unless there are new indications.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation,"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with multiple myeloma and has acute on chronic SDH now
   with readmission with A-Fib and RVR.  Her recent course has been
   complicated by recurrent fevers to >101.5 and only mild leukocytosis in
   U/A seen as possible source.   Patient has had evidence of intermittent
   pulmonary congestion in the setting of persistent atrial fibrillation
   which has been responsive to Lasix Rx--however, patient has modest
   worsening in renal function as defined by creatinine increase.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RASH
   Sub-Dural Hematoma
   -Dilantin
will check level and dose in coordination with Neurology team
   -EEG monitoring to continue
   -LP cultures negative
   Atrial Fibrillation
   -Diltiazem
   -Will need to increase as needed for rate control in the setting of
   fever but will have to let physiology of active infection be balanced
   with need for maintenance of adequate ventricular filling and SV by
   extension.
   Hypoxemia
Clearly a component of unilateral pulmonary edema and
   evidence of mulit-focal opacities consistent with aspiration
   pneumonitis.
   -Lasix as needed
only for refractory hypoxemia and bilateral effusions
   or edema given rising Cr and metabolic alkalosis likely contributed to
   by contraction.
   -Maintain aspiration precautions and npo status
   -Continue with antibiotics for possible pneumonia given concern for
   evolution from pneumonitis to pneumonia with continued fever.
   Sepsis-
   Vanco/Zosyn to continue
   Sputum if obtained
   Rx for possible UTI is in place but aspiration pneumonitis and
   pneumonia may be most clear stimulus for sepsis at this time

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has evidence of blood loss due to hemorrhage or bleeding, which has resulted in acute anemia.

2. Abdominal pain (including abdominal tenderness): The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which may indicate an underlying condition such as an infection or inflammation.

3. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has recurrent fevers, which could be due to an infection or another underlying cause.

4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient has altered mental status, but it is not specified as delirium. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

5. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is an abnormal heart rhythm. It needs to be managed with appropriate medication and rate control measures.

6. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels. This indicates acute renal failure.

7. Rash: The patient has developed a rash, which could be a reaction to medications or an allergic response.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of recent surgery, presenting with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint includes abdominal pain, fever, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. Laboratory results indicate anemia, renal failure, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's current medications include antiepileptic drugs, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. The patient has a tracheostomy and is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with decreased urine output and worsening mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This may be due to hypotension and blood loss during surgery.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, as indicated by the presence of wheezes and crackles on chest examination. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of significant blood loss during surgery, leading to anemia. There is also blood-tinged urine output, indicating"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multi-organ failure. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening mental status and decreased urine output. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on multiple medications including antiepileptic drugs, antibiotics, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of bleeding and is currently experiencing blood-tinged urine, indicating potential ongoing blood loss.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis. There is a concern for hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 2.2 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). This could be secondary to hypoperfusion during septic shock or direct renal damage from toxins.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and low albumin levels, suggesting possible liver involvement.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is below normal, and ABG results show respiratory acidosis. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is already diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of other"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with multiple myeloma, frequent falls, severe peripheral neuropathy, acute on chronic subdural hematoma, and pneumonia after an unwitnessed fall. The patient was transferred back to the MICU after becoming nonresponsive, febrile, and in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient is likely experiencing encephalopathy secondary to seizure activity. An MRI showed acute on subacute embolic infarcts, likely contributing to the subdural hematoma. The patient's diminished gag reflex and minimal response to pain indicate worsening mental status.

2. Fever: The patient's fever is being followed, and she is immunocompromised due to pulse steroids for multiple myeloma. Treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia has been completed with vancomycin and cefepime. Cultures are still negative, and the patient remains hemodynamically stable.

3. Oliguria: The patient had oliguric output in the 20s-30s over the first few days. She appears to be volume overloaded on examination. Lasix was attempted, but it increased creatinine from 1.2 to 1.5. Now the patient is oliguric again with hematuria and rising creatinine to 2.2, suggesting acute renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with multiple myeloma, recent falls, severe peripheral neuropathy, acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma, and pneumonia. She was transferred back to the MICU after becoming nonresponsive, febrile, and in atrial fibrillation. The patient has been diagnosed with encephalopathy, fever, oliguria, right upper quadrant pain, subdural hematoma, atrial fibrillation, respiratory/pneumonia, diarrhea, falls/syncope, myeloma, pancytopenia, renal failure, and fecal incontinence. She has been started on various medications including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and blood transfusions. The patient's condition remains unstable, with worsening respiratory effort, rising creatinine levels, and hematuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity due to subdural hematoma and encephalopathy.
