   anemia, presenting from her [**Hospital3 59**] facility with BRBPR likely
   [**2-11**] diverticular bleeding.
   .
   #. Low GI bleed: Likely diverticular bleeding, given history of
   diverticulosis and story of BRB/clots/maroon stools for past several
   days. Less likely PUD, given hemodynamic stability in setting of BRB
   and clots, though this is possible. HCT drop to 26 in setting of GI
   bleed, plus CVL placement, with adequate response to transfusion.
   - HCT q6hrs
   - If active bleeding continues, consider angio vs tagged RBC scan
   - If pt remains stable, plan for colonoscopy [**4-7**] (Monday)
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue NPO
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with Normocytic, normochromic anemia with normal RDW,
   who has history of PUD and diverticulosis and prior diagnosis of iron
   deficiency anemia on iron replacement therapy. Iron studies with

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of dementia, diverticulosis, and anemia.
- She presented with a likely diverticular bleed, as indicated by her history of diverticulosis and symptoms such as blood-tinged clots and maroon stools.
- Her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped to 26.0 overnight, but responded well to a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC), bringing the HCT back up to 28.5.
- She has been placed on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and is currently NPO (nothing by mouth).
- The plan is to monitor her HCT levels closely, with the goal of keeping them above 30.
- If active bleeding continues, consideration will be given to angiography or a tagged red blood cell scan.
- A colonoscopy is planned for [date] to further investigate the source of the bleed.
- The patient also has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and iron deficiency anemia.
- Her iron studies show elevated serum iron, normal total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and low ferritin levels.
- The patient's dementia is at baseline, and she will continue with her home medications.
- She has a history of hypertension, but beta-blocker therapy will be held until her HCT levels are stable.
- The patient also has a history of hypercho"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of dementia, diverticulosis, and anemia. She presented with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) likely due to diverticular bleeding. Her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped overnight, but responded well to a blood transfusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's physical examination shows pinpoint pupils, no oral lesions, and soft abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly. Her laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of diverticulosis and the presence of guaiac-positive stools suggest ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and HCT levels is necessary. If active bleeding continues, further interventions such as angiography or tagged red blood cell scan may be required.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to advanced age and dementia, making her more susceptible to infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is crucial.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of dementia, diverticulosis, and anemia. She presented to the hospital with bloody rectal bleeding, likely due to diverticular bleeding. Her hemoglobin level dropped to 26.0 overnight and was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells, increasing her hemoglobin level to 28.5. She has ongoing bloody stool and a positive guaiac test. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, with vital signs within normal limits. She is on prophylactic pantoprazole for stress ulcer prevention. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's history of diverticulosis and ongoing bloody stools, there is a risk of further bleeding. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of additional interventions such as angiography or tagged red blood cell scan may be necessary if active bleeding continues.
2. Anemia: The patient's previous diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia and elevated serum iron levels indicate ongoing issues with iron metabolism. Continued monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of iron replacement therapy may be required.
3. Hypotension: Although the patient is currently hemodynamically stable, there is still a risk of developing hypotension due to blood loss and potential for ongoing bleeding. Frequent assessment of blood pressure and appropriate fluid resuscitation if needed are essential.
4. Infection: Due to the insertion of a central line and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of dementia, diverticulosis, and anemia. She presented to the hospital with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which is now resolving. The likely source of the bleed is diverticular bleeding, given her history of diverticulosis and the presence of black, tarry stools (BRB/clots/maroon stools) for several days. Other possible causes such as peptic ulcer disease (PUD) have been ruled out due to the absence of abdominal pain and the patient's hemodynamic stability.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped to 26 during the GI bleed and central venous line (CVL) placement. She received a blood transfusion to maintain a target HCT of over 30%. The plan is to continue monitoring the HCT every 6 hours and transfuse accordingly. If the active bleeding continues, further interventions such as angiography or a tagged red blood cell scan may be considered. A gastrointestinal scope is planned for Monday.

The patient also has a history of peptic ulcer disease and diverticulosis and has been diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia while on iron replacement therapy. Her iron studies show elevated serum iron, normal total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and low ferritin, which is consistent with her history. The patient had no evidence of colorectal cancer on a previous scope 4 years ago. Her daughter states that her diet is adequate."

   Mrs. [**Known firstname 11620**] [**Known lastname 11621**] is a 88 YO F with a h/o dementia, diverticulosis, &
   anemia, presenting from her [**Hospital3 59**] facility with GI bleed.
   .
   #. Low GI bleed: Spontaneously resolving. Likely diverticular bleeding,
   given history of diverticulosis and story of BRB/clots/maroon stools
   for past several days. Less likely PUD, given no abdominal pain, also
   hemodynamic stability in setting of BRB and clots, though this
   diagnosis is also possible. HCT drop to 26 (?BL) in setting of GI
   bleed, plus CVL placement.  Minimal response to transfusion of 4 units
   RBCs total in setting of ~8 episodes of melena overnight.
   - HCT q6hrs, transfuse > 30 hct, type and screen (active), cross 2
   units
   - As pt continued to have active bleeding, tagged RBC scan ordered but
   unable to be completed as no tracer in hospital.
   - If pt remains stable, plan for scope [**4-7**] (Monday)
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Started on clears yesterday, per GI
   - CVL and PIV for access
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with normocytic, normochromic anemia with normal RDW,
   who has history of PUD and diverticulosis and prior diagnosis of iron
   deficiency anemia on iron replacement therapy. HCT drop in setting of
   acute GI bleed and CVL placement. Iron studies with elevated serum
   iron, normal TIBC, low ferritin, consistent with history. Pt had no
   evidence of CRC on scope 4 yrs ago. Pt's daughter states diet is
   adequate.
   - HCTs as above
   - EGD/Colonoscopy, as above
   .
   # Alzheimer Dementia: At baseline per daughter.
   - Continue home medications

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of dementia, diverticulosis, and anemia. She presented to the hospital with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has had multiple episodes of melena overnight and has shown minimal response to transfusion of 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs). Her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped to 26, indicating significant blood loss.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Re-bleeding: The patient has had multiple episodes of melena, indicating ongoing GI bleeding. This puts her at risk for re-bleeding and further blood loss.

2. Hypotension: Given the significant blood loss and low HCT, the patient may experience hypotension and low blood pressure.

3. Shock: In severe cases of blood loss, the patient may develop shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to vital organs.

4. Organ damage: Prolonged and severe bleeding can lead to organ damage, including kidney damage due to decreased blood flow and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

5. Infection: The patient has been in the ICU and has a central venous line (CVL), which increases the risk of developing infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infection.

6. Thrombosis: The presence of a CVL also increases the risk of developing blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary:
The patient in the ICU is being treated for a suspected diverticular bleed, with ongoing blood transfusions and monitoring of hemoglobin levels. They have received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) so far. The plan is to continue monitoring hemoglobin levels and consider an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the morning if bleeding persists. The patient's blood pressure remains high despite being on home blood pressure medications, so they have been started on a short-acting formulation. No tagged RBC scan could be performed due to the unavailability of tracer.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/62 mmHg to 181/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight remains unchanged from admission at 57.4 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2946 mL and output of 1810 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1136 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, blood products, and has had some urine output.

The patient's blood tests show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated hemoglobin levels, and stable platelet count. Kidney function appears to be normal, and electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Liver enzymes are within normal range,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 11620**] [**Known lastname 11621**] is a 88 YO F with a h/o dementia, diverticulosis, &
   anemia, presenting from her [**Hospital3 59**] facility with GI bleed.
   .
   #. Low GI bleed: Spontaneously resolving. Likely diverticular bleeding,
   given history of diverticulosis and story of BRB/clots/maroon stools
   for past several days. Less likely PUD, given no abdominal pain, also
   hemodynamic stability in setting of BRB and clots, though this
   diagnosis is also possible. HCT drop to 26 (?BL) in setting of GI
   bleed, plus CVL placement.  Minimal response to transfusion of 4 units
   RBCs total in setting of ~8 episodes of melena overnight.
   - HCT q6hrs, transfuse > 30 hct, type and screen (active), cross 2
   units
   - As pt continued to have active bleeding, tagged RBC scan ordered but
   unable to be completed as no tracer in hospital.
   - If pt remains stable, plan for scope [**4-7**] (Monday)
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Started on clears yesterday, per GI
   - CVL and PIV for access
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with normocytic, normochromic anemia with normal RDW,
   who has history of PUD and diverticulosis and prior diagnosis of iron
   deficiency anemia on iron replacement therapy. HCT drop in setting of
   acute GI bleed and CVL placement. Iron studies with elevated serum
   iron, normal TIBC, low ferritin, consistent with history. Pt had no
   evidence of CRC on scope 4 yrs ago. Pt's daughter states diet is
   adequate.
   - HCTs as above
   - EGD/Colonoscopy, as above

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of dementia, diverticulosis, and anemia. She was admitted to the hospital with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The GI bleed is likely caused by diverticular bleeding, given her history of diverticulosis and the presence of blood and clots in her stool. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has decreased to 26, indicating significant blood loss. Despite receiving 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs), there has been minimal response to the transfusion.

Plan:
- Monitor HCT every 6 hours and transfuse RBCs to maintain a HCT of over 30.
- Perform a tagged RBC scan to locate the source of bleeding.
- Plan for an upper endoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy next Monday.
- Continue pantoprazole IV to prevent stress ulcers.
- Start the patient on clear liquids.
- Maintain intravenous access through a central venous line (CVL) and peripheral intravenous (PIV) line.
- Resume home blood pressure medication, including metoprolol XL 50 mg daily.
- Switch to atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia while in the hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's HCT is still low, indicating ongoing blood loss. If the bleeding does not stop, it can lead to further deterioration in her hemodynamic"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with
   the note above, including the assessment and plan.  To that I would add
   the following:
   She has needed a total of 6 units pRBC
s so far. Area of bleeding in
   sigmoid colon appears to have stopped. Results of angiogram noted. She
   remains hemodynamically stable at this time but NPO.
   We will advance diet today and assess if bleeding recurs. If this
   should be the casem GI staff will opine regarding need for flex sig for
   therapeutic reasons. If not repeat attempts at therapeutic angiography
   or have surgical colleagues opine.
   If she remains stable, will transfer to Medical floor today.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of dementia, diverticulosis, and anemia who presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has had multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfused and has shown improvement in her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) levels. 

The initial assessment indicates that the patient may have a diverticular bleed, given her history of diverticulosis and the presence of blood and clots in her stool. However, the possibility of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) cannot be completely ruled out.

The patient underwent a tagged red blood cell scan, which revealed bleeding in the sigmoid colon. An angiogram was performed but did not find any active bleeding in the SMA, [Female First Name (un)], or abdominal aorta.

The patient's current condition is stable, and she is expected to be transferred to the medical floor later today if her Hct levels remain stable. The plan is to continue with the clears diet and monitor for any signs of recurrent bleeding. If necessary, a flexible sigmoidoscopy may be performed for therapeutic reasons. Surgical intervention may be considered if the patient remains unstable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent bleeding: Despite the current stability, there is a risk of further bleeding from the sigmoid colon. Close monitoring is essential to detect any signs of recurrent bleeding.

2. Infection: The patient's immune system may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to ongoing bleeding, with varying hematocrit (Hct) levels recorded. The patient has been started on clears per GI and the plan is to monitor Hcts and consider an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the morning if bleeding persists. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on home beta-blockers (BBs), so they were resumed in a short-acting formulation. A tagged red cell scan showed blood coming from the sigmoid colon that pools in the rectum, but no active bleed was found during an angiography. Hemostasis was achieved with digital compression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: Despite interventions, the patient continues to show evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further blood loss and potentially result in hypovolemic shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating potential hypotension. This can be a result of ongoing blood loss or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability state in critically ill"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 11620**] [**Known lastname 11621**] is a 88 YO F with a h/o dementia, diverticulosis, &
   anemia, who presented from her [**Hospital3 59**] facility with GI bleed.
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed: Resolving. Likely diverticular bleed, given history
   of diverticulosis and story of BRB/clots/maroon stools for past several
   days. Less likely PUD, given no abdominal pain, also hemodynamic
   stability in setting of BRB and clots, though this diagnosis is also
   possible. HCT drop to 26 (?BL) in setting of GI bleed, plus CVL
   placement.  Patient has had response to transfusion of 6 units RBCs
   despite ongoing maroon stools (have decreased overnigh) with today
   HCT 28.7.
   - As pt continued to have active bleeding, tagged RBC scan ordered
   which showed bleeding in sigmoid colon.  Angio done and no bleed found
   through SMA, [**Female First Name (un) **], abdominal aorta.
   - ? if GI plans to scope tomorrow
   - HCT q6hrs, transfuse > 30 hct, type and screen (active), cross 2
   units
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Started on clears yesterday, per GI
   - CVL and PIV for access
   - As stool output has decreased, and pt
s HCT and HDs have been stable,
   could c/o to floor later today.
   .
   # Anemia: Patient with normocytic, normochromic anemia with normal RDW,
   who has history of PUD and diverticulosis and prior diagnosis of iron
   deficiency anemia on iron replacement therapy. HCT drop in setting of
   acute GI bleed and CVL placement. Iron studies with elevated serum
   iron, normal TIBC, low ferritin, consistent with history. Pt had no
   evidence of CRC on scope 4 yrs ago. Pt's daughter states diet is
   adequate.
   - HCTs as above
   - EGD/Colonoscopy, per GI recs.
   .
   # Alzheimer Dementia: At baseline per daughter.
   - Continue home medications
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt on metoprolol XL 50 Daily at home.
   - resumed home BB [**4-4**] in short-acting formulation given persistent
   hypertension.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Pt on lovastatin.
   - Switch to atorvastatin while in house
   .
   #. H/o Breast cancer - In remision.
   - No BP or blood draws in R arm.
