   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3299**] is an 83 year-old man with a history of coronary artery
   disease and respiratory failure due to acute-on-chronic systolic CHF.
   1. Acute on chronic systolic CHF plus severe mitral regurgitation:
   - furosemide 80 mg IV bolus followed by 8 mg/hr drip; added Diural
   250mg for goal of net negative 100 cc/hr
   - cont amiodarone for beta blockade
   - Continue ACE, although have low threshold to d/c in case of worsening
   renal function
   - cycle enzymes to rule out acute infarction as cause of decompensation
   - low Na/fluid restricted diet
   - consider transfer to CCU service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4533**] is in agreement
   2. Hypoxemia: likely secondary to pulmonary edema and decompensated
   heart failure; lack of fever, sputum production, leukocytosis, bandemia
   all argue against pneumonia
   - hold further antibiotics for now
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need another ABG today as pt is hypercarbic but appears to be
   compensated
   3. Coronary artery disease:
   - cont home aspirin, clopidogrel, statin
   - cycle enzymes
   4. Atrial fibrillation:
   - cont amiodarone
   - hold warfarin given supratherapeutic INR and possibility of invasive
   procedure; if subtherapeutic, can use IV heparin
   5. Acute on chronic renal failure (baseline CKD IV): likely due to poor
   forward flow from decompensated CHF as above
   - urine lytes, urine eo
s- pending
   - diuresis as above
   6. DM2: on oral agents at home
   - sliding scale insulin
   7. Anxiety:
   - cont home citalopram; prn low-dose lorazepam

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and respiratory failure due to acute-on-chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with symptoms of hypoxemia, likely secondary to pulmonary edema and decompensated heart failure. There are no signs of pneumonia. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease stage IV. He is currently on various medications, including furosemide, amiodarone, ACE inhibitors, aspirin, clopidogrel, and statins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of CHF: The patient's symptoms, such as diffuse crackles in the chest and edema in the legs, suggest worsening heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiovascular status is crucial.
2. Pneumonia: Although the lack of fever, sputum production, leukocytosis, and bandemia argue against pneumonia, it cannot be completely ruled out. Monitoring for any changes in respiratory status and obtaining cultures if symptoms worsen.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline chronic kidney disease stage IV may worsen due to poor forward flow from decompensated CHF. Monitoring renal function through lab tests and adjusting diuretic therapy accordingly.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease increases the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease and respiratory failure due to acute-on-chronic systolic congestive heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected pneumonia, but it is unclear if he actually had pneumonia. He has been diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation, hypoxemia, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and anxiety. The patient is currently on multiple medications including furosemide, chlorthiazide, amiodarone, ACE inhibitors, aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, citalopram, and sliding scale insulin. He is also receiving IV fluids and has a nasogastric tube and various monitoring lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's current condition of acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure indicates an underlying cardiac issue. If his heart function deteriorates further, it could lead to worsening heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid accumulation, and decreased cardiac output.

2. Pneumonia: Although there is no clear evidence of pneumonia based on the lack of fever, sputum production, leukocytosis, and bandemia, it is still a possibility due to the patient's compromised respiratory function. Pneumonia can develop as a nosocomial infection or due"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient was previously on BiPap but was switched to an NRB facemask due to concerns for pneumonia. Antibiotics were considered but ultimately held off. The patient is currently receiving a Lasix drip and Diuril 250 mg. Blood cultures, ABG, and other tests are pending. The patient also received a low dose of Ativan for agitation and had a consultation with a cardiologist.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The infusion of Furosemide (Lasix) started on [**2137-8-14**] at 05:00 PM. Other medications and changes to medical and family history are not mentioned.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/61 to 131/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the non-rebreather mask. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe systolic heart failure, mitral regurgitation, and chronic renal failure. He presents with increasing shortness of breath over the past few weeks. In the emergency department, his blood pressure was 100/57 mmHg, and he was started on saline and levofloxacin. He also received IV lasix, then lasix drip, and diuril in the MICU. The patient has a history of LAD STEMI and cholecystitis with a cholecystomy tube. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for his shortness of breath. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/61 mmHg to 131/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on non-rebreather oxygen and bipap. The physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in both lungs, non-tender distended abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses. The patient's labs show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, among other findings. The patient has a large bilateral effusion on chest X-ray. The assessment and plan include respiratory distress due to congestive heart failure and cardiac asthma, continuation of lasix drip, and consideration of albuterol/atrovent for wheezing. An"
