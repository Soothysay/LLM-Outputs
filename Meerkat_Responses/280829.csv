   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female s/p recent complicated hospitalization presenting
   with acute altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status: Her overall picture is most consistent with a
   global toxic-metabolic insult given the degree of impairment and the
   lack of focal findings on physical examination.  She has impressive
   lower extremity clonus with increased tone/rigidity (predominantly in
   the legs).  Differential diagnosis includes HSV encephalitis vs.
   meningitis vs. pons lesion of unclear significance vs. seizure vs.
   serotonin syndrome vs. infectious etiology (C. Diff, PNA).
   --IR guided LP to r/o meningitis and HSV encephalitis
   --Empiric coverage for meningitis pending LP results.  Bacterial
   meningitis unlikely given lack of fever and leukocytosis.  Cefepime,
   Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Ampicillin
   --Empiric coverage for HSV encephalitis with acyclovir pending HSV PCR
   results
   --MRI brain to evaluate the pons lesion and septic emboli given
   possible endocarditis.
   --D/C celexa, hold aricept for now
   --24 hour continuous EEG monitoring. Continue Versed drip and bolus
   prn.
   -- tox screen, positive benzos
   --Appreciate neurology evaluation and recommendations
   --Infectious work-up: C. diff negative  pending, PNA see below.
   # Respiratory failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 6072**] was intubated in the setting of
   agitation, admission team felt unlikely asthma exacerbation. Final CT
   scan demonstrates diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly within
   upper lobes
 represent infection vs. aspiration. On admission being
   treated for healthcare associated pneumonia.
   --Treament for HCAP with Cefepime, Vancomycin and levofloxacin.
   Patient had completed 12 days of Zosyn prior to admission and clearly
   worsened on this medication, though not from cholangitis, which this
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**] was treating.
   -- Influenza negative
   -- Viral culture negative
   --Check urine legionella antigen
   --Standing albuterol nebs for now
   --Continue outpatient Advair
   # Anemia: HCT 25 from 28 on admission. Guaiac negative on admission.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Continue to trend. Transfuse for HCT < 21 or
   signs of active bleeding.
   # Endocarditis: mildly thickened MV leaflets on last echocardiogram
   without discrete vegetation. No further imaging was pursued as unclear
   if patient would be able to tolerate.  Consider TEE now that intubated,
   especially if febrile or positive blood cultures. MRI today can assess
   for septic emboli causing mental status changes.
   # Back pain: Complained of back pain past admission, no imaging to
   evaluate for disciitis/osteomyelitis as planned to treat with 6 weeks
   of antibiotics. Currently work-up of acute mental status change most
   important, consider MRI spine to r/o infection at later date. Continue
   ABx as above.
   # h/o NSTEMI: continue medical management with aspirin, betablocker and
   statin. HR well controlled.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent complicated hospitalization, presenting with acute altered mental status. She has impressive lower extremity clonus with increased tone/rigidity. The differential diagnosis includes HSV encephalitis, meningitis, pons lesion, seizure, serotonin syndrome, and infectious etiology such as C. Diff or PNA. Empiric coverage for meningitis and HSV encephalitis has been initiated, along with an MRI brain to evaluate the pons lesion and septic emboli.

The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia with cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. Her HCT has decreased from 28 to 25, indicating anemia. The hemolysis labs are negative. She has a history of NSTEMI and is being managed with aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin. The patient also complains of back pain, but imaging to evaluate for discitis/osteomyelitis is pending. She is on prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further work-up."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a recent complicated hospitalization who presented with acute mental status changes (AMS), increased Troponin T levels, hypotension, and decreased urine output. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, altered mental status, respiratory failure, anemia, possible endocarditis, and back pain.

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 75/23 mmHg to 90/37 mmHg. The etiology of hypotension is unclear and could be due to cardiogenic shock, sepsis, or sedation-related preload issues. The patient is currently on norepinephrine infusion to maintain blood pressure above 65 mmHg.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits global toxic-metabolic insult with impressive lower extremity clonus, increased tone/rigidity, and lack of focal findings on physical examination. Differential diagnosis includes infection (HSV encephalitis vs. meningitis vs. C. diff vs. HCAP), pons lesion of unclear significance, seizure, and serotonin syndrome. Empiric coverage for meningitis with acyclovir for HSV, along with cefepime, levofloxacin, and vancomycin for HCAP, has been initiated. Continuous EEG monitoring is planned to evaluate for seizures.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] year old female s/p recent complicated hospitalization presenting
   with acute altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status: Her overall picture is most consistent with a
   global toxic-metabolic insult given the degree of impairment and the
   lack of focal findings on physical examination.  She has impressive
   lower extremity clonus with increased tone/rigidity (predominantly in
   the legs).  Differential diagnosis includes HSV encephalitis vs.
   meningitis vs. pons lesion of unclear significance vs. seizure vs.
   serotonin syndrome vs. infectious etiology (C. Diff, PNA).
   --IR guided LP to r/o meningitis and HSV encephalitis
   --Empiric coverage for meningitis pending LP results.  Bacterial
   meningitis unlikely given lack of fever and leukocytosis.  Cefepime,
   Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Ampicillin
   --Empiric coverage for HSV encephalitis with acyclovir pending HSV PCR
   results
   --MRI brain to evaluate the pons lesion and septic emboli given
   possible endocarditis.
   --D/C celexa, hold aricept for now
   --24 hour continuous EEG monitoring. Continue Versed drip and bolus
   prn.
   -- tox screen, positive benzos
   --Appreciate neurology evaluation and recommendations
   --Infectious work-up: C. diff negative  pending, PNA see below.
   # Respiratory failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 6072**] was intubated in the setting of
   agitation, admission team felt unlikely asthma exacerbation. Final CT
   scan demonstrates diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly within
   upper lobes
 represent infection vs. aspiration. On admission being
   treated for healthcare associated pneumonia.
   --Treament for HCAP with Cefepime, Vancomycin and levofloxacin.
   Patient had completed 12 days of Zosyn prior to admission and clearly
   worsened on this medication, though not from cholangitis, which this
   [**Doctor Last Name 23**] was treating.
   -- Influenza negative
   -- Viral culture negative
   --Check urine legionella antigen
   --Standing albuterol nebs for now
   --Continue outpatient Advair
   # Anemia: HCT 25 from 28 on admission. Guaiac negative on admission.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Continue to trend. Transfuse for HCT < 21 or
   signs of active bleeding.
   # Endocarditis: mildly thickened MV leaflets on last echocardiogram
   without discrete vegetation. No further imaging was pursued as unclear
   if patient would be able to tolerate.  Consider TEE now that intubated,
   especially if febrile or positive blood cultures. MRI today can assess
   for septic emboli causing mental status changes.
   # Back pain: Complained of back pain past admission, no imaging to
   evaluate for disciitis/osteomyelitis as planned to treat with 6 weeks
   of antibiotics. Currently work-up of acute mental status change most
   important, consider MRI spine to r/o infection at later date. Continue
   ABx as above.
   # h/o NSTEMI: continue medical management with aspirin, betablocker and
   statin. HR well controlled.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition can be summarized as follows:

1. The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent hospitalization and multiple comorbidities, including endocarditis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, and chronic anemia.

2. The patient presented with acute altered mental status, hypotension, and increased serum tryptophan levels. The differential diagnosis includes infection (HSV encephalitis, meningitis, C. diff, HCAP), pons lesion, seizure, and serotonin syndrome. An MRI without clear cause was performed, and further evaluation is needed.

3. The patient has decreased urine output, which is unclear in etiology. Possible causes include contrast-induced nephropathy, prerenal azotemia, or sepsis. Monitoring of urine output and continuing therapeutic fluid administration is recommended.

4. The patient's hypotension is of unclear etiology, with suspicion for cardiogenic shock, sepsis, or sedation-related preload problem. The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the high 80s, and a trans-thoracic echo showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. Pressor support with norepinephrine is being provided, and weaning off sedation is planned.

5. The patient was intubated due to agitation and has a history of healthcare-associated pneumonia. The final CT scan showed diffuse ground-glass opacities within"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent hospitalization, chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, and endocarditis. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, decreased urine output, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. She is also receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine. Her laboratory results show acute renal failure, elevated troponin levels, and evidence of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including elevated white blood cell count and positive blood cultures. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and may require aggressive treatment.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and diffuse ground-glass opacities on imaging suggest the possibility of ARDS. ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and impaired oxygenation.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and elevated troponin levels indicate a possible cardiac cause for her shock state. Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest AKI. This condition can be reversible with appropriate management, but it requires prompt intervention to prevent"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, endocarditis, and renal failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypotension of unclear etiology, suspected cardiogenic shock or sepsis, and is currently on norepinephrine infusion. She also has decreased urine output, most likely due to prerenal azotemia or contrast-induced nephropathy. 

The patient's altered mental status is consistent with a global toxic-metabolic insult, and the differential diagnosis includes infection (such as HSV encephalitis or meningitis), a pons lesion, seizure, or serotonin syndrome. The patient is being treated empirically for meningitis with acyclovir for HSV, and coverage for healthcare-associated pneumonia with cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin.

The patient's respiratory failure is thought to be due to infection versus aspiration, with diffuse ground-glass opacities seen on a recent CT scan. She has completed 12 days of Zosyn prior to admission and clearly worsened on this medication.

The patient's anemia has an unclear etiology, with a baseline Hct of 28. There is no evidence of hemolysis, and the patient is being transfused with 1pRBC given possible demand ischemia.

The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but self-extubated and is now on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode set at 450 mL, PS 5 cmH2O, RR (set) 14, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 35%, PIP 11 cmH2O, and Plateau 22 cmH2O. Her SpO2 is maintained at 100%. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 117/43 to 149/87 mmHg, heart rate between 60 and 127 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 30900/uL, anemia with a Hct of 24.1%, elevated creatinine levels of 1.1 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T levels of 0.37. Other lab values indicate possible electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by a decrease in urine output and elevated creatinine levels. 

The assessment and plan include hypotension,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with multiple medical complications. The note outlines the following potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, but there is no indication of shock.
2. Anemia, chronic: The patient has a long-standing low hemoglobin level, suggesting chronic anemia.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]): The patient has experienced acute respiratory failure, but it is not specified as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient has a change in mental status, likely due to toxic encephalopathy secondary to medications. EEG results show diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy.
5. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient is showing signs of acute kidney injury, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy or pre-renal causes.
6. Endocarditis, history of: The patient has a history of endocarditis.
7. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]): The patient initially had respiratory failure, but it appears to be improving after discontinuing antibiotics and providing diuretic therapy.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based solely on the information provided in the progress note. A thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to confirm and manage"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a complex medical history, including chronic anemia, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, and a history of endocarditis. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. 

The patient experienced an unplanned extubation twice, requiring reintubation. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 117/43 mmHg to 149/87 mmHg and a heart rate between 56-127 bpm. Oxygen saturation remains at 100%. 

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with delirium and global encephalopathy observed on EEG. She has impressive lower extremity clonus with increased tone and rigidity, which is improving. The differential diagnosis includes infection, pons lesion, seizure, and serotonin syndrome. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, with decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels. A possible cause could be contrast-induced nephropathy or prerenal azotemia. 

Hypotension is also present, with unclear etiology, possibly due to cardiogenic shock, sepsis, or sedation-related preload-problem. 

The patient's respiratory status is being managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen. The recent CT scan shows diffuse ground-glass opacities within the upper lobes, which may represent infection or aspiration. 

Anemia is present, with unclear etiology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent hospitalization, complicated by acute altered mental status, hypotension, respiratory failure, and renal failure. She has a history of endocarditis and has been treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient's recent CT scan shows diffuse ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes, which may represent infection or aspiration. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been extubated twice due to agitation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains hypotensive and requires pressor support. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased troponin levels, and signs of renal dysfunction. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure and is receiving lasix for fluid management. Anemia and back pain are also noted, but their etiologies remain unclear. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate). Disposition is pending further work-up.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern due to the diffuse ground-glass opacities seen on the CT scan. This could indicate an ongoing infection or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure. Continuous monitoring of renal function and appropriate management of fluid balance and electroly"
