   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # Chest pain/hypotension: Patient with cancer, s/p radiation and
   chemotherapy with subtle diffuse EKG changes and new small pericardial
   effusion that is not impairing the homodynamic, but may be causing
   chest pain. This would be compatible with the picture of pericarditis.
   However, treatment cannot be given in the setting of low platelets. In
   the other hand, patient presented with sudden pain and with
   bradycardia, which may suggest esophageal spasm with posterior
   vaso-vagal in the setting of low intravascular volume, mostly in a
   patient with history of bad reflux and GI ulcers. Another possibility
   is anxiety or TRAP.
   -          Follow homodynamic parameters
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] be able to go to floor if stable in PM
   -          Measure CVP; goal [**4-26**].
   -          Fluids if hypotensive
   -          Continue antibiotics for now (cefepime for neutropenia in
   setting of possible infection)
   -          Continue levofloxacin for UTI
   # Thomrobycotpenia: transfuse with a goal of >10,000
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin.
   .
   # GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   -discuss w/ BMT team in a.m. further management for the patient's
   lymphoma
   .
   # ANEMIA: tx for hct < 21.  tx plts < 10.
   .
   # FEN:  regular diet, PPI as above
   .
   # Access  Central line, IJ
   .
   # PPx:  pneumoboots (no sc heparin as thrombocytopenic)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presenting with chest pain and hypotension after a platelet transfusion. She has undergone multiple treatment courses for her cancer, including radiation and chemotherapy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 95/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and is receiving fluids intravenously. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 16 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, elevated glucose level of 147 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 19 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, but peripheral pulses and neurologic assessments are not documented. The assessment includes multiple issues such as chest pain/hypotension, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal concerns, ongoing lymphoma treatment, anemia, and nutritional support. The plan involves monitoring hemodynamics, considering transfer to the floor if stable, measuring central venous pressure, administering antibiotics, transfusing platelets, continuing cancer treatment discussions, managing gastrointestinal concerns, and providing prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with chest pain and hypotension during a platelet transfusion. She has persistent hypotension and was initially planned for discharge to the floor but was unable to due to her condition. A steroid stress test was performed, and the patient was started on stress dose steroids. However, since the test was normal, treatment with lower-dose steroids was continued. A repeat chest X-ray showed left heart border opacification, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia. The patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime for broader coverage in the setting of febrile neutropenia and levofed drip. Despite attempts to come off the overnight, the patient's pressures continued to drop into the mid-80s. The patient has a history of allergies to cefepime and skin reactions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent hypotension and fever could indicate a potential septic response, especially considering her immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy for DLBCL.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and decreased cardiac output may suggest cardiogenic shock, possibly secondary to her underlying malignancy or complications from chemotherapy.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The left heart border opacification on the chest X-ray raises the possibility of pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency or anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and
   magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with
   IV magnesium however this was prolonged and after the infusion had
   stopped and the hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills /
   rigors or other symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but
   had also rec'd 10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.
   Transfusion reaction would not be expected to cause hypotension unless
   it were of an anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such
   as respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect
   clinically pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level
   measured yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which
   indicates likely relative adrenal insufficiency in a patient who has
   been on steroids in the past for chemotherapy.
   - given one dose stress dose steroid 50 IV yesterday, will continue at
   stress dose levels for now given hypotension, also suspect that iv
   steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical evidence
   of pericarditis
   - had to be restarted on iv levofed yesterday evening for blood
   pressures of 80s to maintain MAPs > 60, attempted to wean x4 but was
   unsuccessful, will attempt to wean again today
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis
   - added vancomycin yesterday in the setting of possible new infiltrate
   on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or alternatively and more
   likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking deep breaths secondary
   to pain
   -blood cultures pending
   -mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan given multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and immune suppression pending
   -Central venous line placed
   -maintained CVP of [**10-1**] even during repeated episodes of hypotension
   - AM CVP was 13
   - will check SvO2 again today and consider additional blood transfusion
   if low as crit still remains 24 in the setting of hypotension on
   pressors
   - follow-up with repeat EKG
   .# ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin for
   neutropenic prophylaxis.
   .
   # GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   -BMT recs to start iv steroids and possibly cover for pnuemonia as
   above, will follow-up with new thoughts today
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with repeated episode of chest pain in the same
   locatin which is worse with inspiration.  Pain is concerning for
   pericarditis, the patient also has a small but new pericardial effusion
   on chest CT and echo.  Also with diffuse ST segment changes.
   Hypotensive but pulsus is 4 and echo is negative for any signs of
   tamponade.  Pain may also be secondary to esophageal spasms in the
   setting of gastric ulcer and radiation, however this clinically does
   not fit with hypotension.   Another possibility is that patient is
   anxious and this represents a manifestation of that, however again this
   doesn
t clinically fit with hypotesnsion.
   -repeat EKG from yesterday looks the same as previous, put in for
   official ekg this am and will follow-up with results
   -prelim read CTA chest .
   No PE in main, lobar or segmental branches. Small pericardial effusion
   is
   new. No consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
   Appearance of the stomach similar with prominent folds. No acute
   abdominal
   process.
   -pain possibly related to gastric ulcer, however less likely given
   location
   -enzymes negative, telemetry monitoring, started tylenol for pain,
   cannot give aspirin given thrombocytopenia, in addition increased
   oxycodone dosing to 10 mg PO PRN
   -in addition patient felt anxious during this episode so this may be a
   possibility, and her pain initially improved w/ ativan
   .
   # ANEMIA: tx for hct < 21.  tx plts < 10
   - this Am platelets are 10, no active signs of bleed, will send PM CBC
   .
   # FEN:  regular diet, PPI as above, patient still without bowel
   movement although not eating much
   .
   # Access  Central line, IJ
   .
   # PPx:  pneumoboots (no sc heparin as thrombocytopenic), Ppi, colace,

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with chest pain and hypotension during a platelet transfusion. She has persistent hypotension despite treatment, including stress dose steroids, and requires continuous infusion of norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient is also receiving vancomycin and cefepime for broad coverage in the setting of febrile neutropenia, and levofed drip to manage blood pressure. Repeat chest X-ray shows left heart border opacification, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia. Blood cultures are pending, and mycologic blood cultures, beta glucan, and galactomannan are being considered due to multiple rounds of chemotherapy and immune suppression. The patient has a central venous line placed and is being closely monitored for SvO2 levels and blood transfusion needs. Additional diagnostic tests, including a repeat EKG and CT abdomen, have been ordered. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she will continue to be monitored in the ICU until her blood pressure normalizes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and fever could indicate septic shock, especially considering the recent platelet transfusion and febrile neutropenia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) have been initiated, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   an includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic,
   anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and magnesium prior
   to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with IV magnesium
   however this was prolonged and after the infusion had stopped and the
   hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills / rigors or other
   symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but had also rec'd
   10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.  Transfusion reaction
   would not be expected to cause hypotension unless it were of an
   anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such as
   respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and low grade temp of 99.6 infection is a
   possibility.  CTA was negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative
   ruling out cardiogenic as a process. EKG with diffuse ST elevations
   however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect clinically
   pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level measured
   yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which is adequate
   bump.
   - given one dose stress dose steroid 50 IV yesterday, changed to
   solumedrol 20 IV BID because [**Last Name (un) **] stim test showed appropriate
   response, also suspect that iv steroids will help with inflammation if
   patient with clinical evidence of pericarditis
   - had to be restarted on iv levofed yesterday evening for blood
   pressures of 80s to maintain MAPs > 60, attempted to wean x4 but was
   unsuccessful, will attempt to wean again today
   -UA neg LE or nitrate with 1 WBC, UTI unlikely
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic fever
   (hypotension)
   - added vancomycin yesterday in the setting of possible new infiltrate
   on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or alternatively and more
   likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking deep breaths secondary
   to pain
   -blood cultures pending
   -mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan given multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and immune suppression pending
   -Central venous line placed
   -maintained CVP of [**10-1**] even during repeated episodes of hypotension
   .
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin for
   neutropenic prophylaxis.
   .
   # GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   -BMT recs to start iv steroids and possibly cover for pnuemonia as
   above, will follow-up with new thoughts today
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with repeated episode of chest pain in the same
   locatin which is worse with inspiration.  Pain is concerning for
   pericarditis, the patient also has a small but new pericardial effusion
   on chest CT and echo.  Also with diffuse ST segment changes.
   Hypotensive but pulsus is 4 and echo is negative for any signs of
   tamponade.  Pain may also be secondary to esophageal spasms in the
   setting of gastric ulcer and radiation, however this clinically does
   not fit with hypotension.   Another possibility is that patient is
   anxious and this represents a manifestation of that, however again this
   doesn
t clinically fit with hypotesnsion.
   -repeat EKG from yesterday looks the same as previous, put in for
   official ekg this am and will follow-up with results
   -prelim read CTA chest .
   No PE in main, lobar or segmental branches. Small pericardial effusion
   is
   new. No consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
   Appearance of the stomach similar with prominent folds. No acute
   abdominal
   process.
   -pain possibly related to gastric ulcer, however less likely given
   location
   -enzymes negative, telemetry monitoring, started tylenol for pain,
   cannot give aspirin given thrombocytopenia, in addition increased
   oxycodone dosing to 10 mg PO PRN
   -in addition patient felt anxious during this episode so this may be a
   possibility, and her pain initially improved w/ ativan
   .
   # ANEMIA: tx for hct < 21.  tx plts < 10
   - this Am platelets are 10, no active signs of bleed, will send PM CBC
   .
   # FEN:  regular diet, PPI as above
   .
   # Access  Central line, IJ
   .
   # PPx:  pneumoboots (no sc heparin as thrombocytopenic), Ppi, colace,
   senna

","Summary:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) despite multiple treatment courses.
- She presents with chest pain and hypotension during a platelet transfusion.
- The patient has persistent hypotension and required a stress dose of steroids.
- She also has a fever and neutropenia, so broad-spectrum antibiotics were started.
- There is evidence of possible infection on a chest X-ray, so vancomycin was added.
- The patient's blood pressures are still in the 80s, and she is on a levofed drip.
- Other findings include lymphoma-related gastrointestinal issues and a small pericardial effusion on imaging.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to various causes, including distributive, obstructive, cardiogenic, or anaphylactic shock. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Infection: The patient's neutropenic fever and new infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggest a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and blood cultures are pending.
3. Pericarditis: The patient's chest pain that worsens with inspiration, along with the small pericardial effusion seen on imaging and diffuse ST segment changes on EKG, raise suspicion for pericarditis. Corticosteroids have been initiated to manage inflammation"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Overnight started on low-dose pressors [**12-20**] refractory hypotension --
   nadired at SBP ~70 in late afternoon. CVP ~11 at this time, increased
   to 13. Vanc was added given concern for possible left basilar pneumonia
   from chest x-ray overnight.
   She received one unit of pRBCs last night with Hct 24%. Her central
   venous sat yesterday evening was 62%, as well, which prompted the
   transfusion.
   Underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-stim test -- time zero her cortisol was 4, increased
   to 23 after ACTH. Received Hydrocortisone 50mg x 1 overnight.
   Finally she was started on Tylenol for pain and her PRN oxycodone was
   increased for persistent chest pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 51yo woman with NHL now day 16 s/p ICE chemo admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] yesterday with hypotension and chest pain. Chest pain does not
   appear to be ischemic in nature
 she has ruled out for a MI with
   serial enzymes. Pericarditis is a possibility but it is difficult to
   rectify this with her persistent hypotension.
   1)Hypotension: No e/o obstructive physiology as TTE and CTA do not
   reveal tamponade or PE. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility, however,
   she has ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and her TTE doesn
t reveal
   any RWMAs. Infection is a possibiility and she is on broad spectrum
   antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime) in the setting of her chemo-induced
   neutropenia. Her chest x-ray has a suggestion of a left basilar process
   that may be unimpressive given that she is neutropenic and unable to
   mount a significant inflammatory response. Will follow serial imaging,
   blood and putum cultures and continue empiric antbiotics at this time.
   Hypovolemia may be playing a role, however her CVP is [**10-1**]. She is s/p
   a blood transfusion last night without an expected increase in her Hct.
   No e/o acute blood loss. Will recheck SvO2 again this morning (was 62%
   last night) and transfuse again today if it remains <70%. Finally, her
   random cortisol was 4 yesterday c/w adrenal insufficiency; will dose
   her with stress-dose steroids and follow. Attempt to wean pressors as
   tolerated.
   -If no obvious rapid resolution will have to consider arterial catheter
   for truly accurate ABP monitoring given
   2)Chest Pain: Appears to have improved with increased analgesia.
   Although dificult to determine actual primary source
certainly to link
   it with the hypotension one is concerned about possible myocardial or
   pericardial involvement but on ECHO and CT that has not proven to be
   clear source at this time.  ECG is not changed from yesterday.
   -Expect improvement with in pericarditis with Hydrocortisone at 50mg q
   6 hours
   -Will re-review CT scan findings with radiology
   3) Anemia / thrombocytopenia: Will transfuse if SvO2 remains low this
   morning. Hold on platelets if she has e/o active bleeding or if
   platelets decrease to less than 10.
   4) F/E/N: Regular diet. Follow / replete
lytes. No need for standing
   IVF.
   5) Access: Right IJ.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who has been admitted to the ICU for hypotension and chest pain. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Her chest x-ray shows a possible left basilar process. The patient received a blood transfusion last night but did not show an expected increase in her hematocrit (Hct) level. She has low blood pressure and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 62%, indicating inadequate tissue perfusion. The patient's cortisol level was low, suggesting adrenal insufficiency, and she was started on stress-dose steroids. She is also taking Tylenol for pain and her oxycodone dose was increased for persistent chest pain. The patient's blood cultures came back negative. The EKG showed no changes from the previous day. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia will be managed accordingly. She is on a regular diet and does not require standing IV fluids. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate cardiogenic shock, infection, hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

She was started on low-dose pressors overnight and her blood pressure was still low at around 70 mmHg in the late afternoon. Her central venous pressure (CVP) was increased to 13. Vanc was added due to concern for possible left basilar pneumonia from the chest x-ray overnight.

She received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) last night with a hematocrit (Hct) of 24%. Her central venous saturation (CVP) was 62% yesterday evening, which prompted the transfusion.

 she has ruled out for a MI with
   serial enzymes. Pericarditis is a possibility but it is difficult to
   rectify this with her persistent hypotension.
   1)Hypotension: No e/o obstructive physiology as TTE and CTA do not
   reveal tamponade or PE. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility, however,
   she has ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and her TTE doesn
t reveal
   any RWMAs. Infection is a possibiility and she is on broad spectrum
   antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime) in the setting of her chemo-induced
   neutropenia. Her chest x-ray has a suggestion of a left basilar process
   that may be unimpressive given that she is neutropenic and unable to
   mount a significant inflammatory response. Will follow serial imaging,
   blood and putum cultures and continue empiric antbiotics at this time.
   Hypovolemia may be playing a role, however her CVP is [**10-1**]. She is s/p
   a blood transfusion last night without an expected increase in her Hct.
   No e/o acute blood loss. Will recheck SvO2 again this morning (was 62%
   last night) and transfuse again today if it remains <70%. Finally, her
   random cortisol was 4 yesterday c/w adrenal insufficiency; will dose
   her with stress-dose steroids and follow. Attempt to wean pressors as
   tolerated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who is currently admitted to the ICU. She was admitted yesterday with hypotension and chest pain. The chest pain does not appear to be ischemic in nature, as serial enzymes have ruled out myocardial infarction. 

The patient's hypotension persists despite fluid resuscitation, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is around 13, which suggests that hypovolemia may not be the primary cause. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 62%, indicating potential tissue hypoperfusion. 

She has been started on low-dose pressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics due to concern for possible left basilar pneumonia from the chest x-ray. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 19, and elevated lactate levels. 

Further assessment is needed to determine the cause of her persistent hypotension. Possible causes to consider include cardiogenic shock, infection, hypovolemia, or adrenal insufficiency. 

The patient's chest pain appears to have improved with increased analgesia. 

In terms of management, the patient's blood transfusion will be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency or anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and
   magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with
   IV magnesium however this was prolonged and after the infusion had
   stopped and the hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills /
   rigors or other symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but
   had also rec'd 10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.
   Transfusion reaction would not be expected to cause hypotension unless
   it were of an anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such
   as respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect
   clinically pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level
   measured yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which
   indicates likely relative adrenal insufficiency in a patient who has
   been on steroids in the past for chemotherapy.
   - on stress dose hydrocortisone started PM [**8-11**], also suspect that iv
   steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical evidence
   of pericarditis, also on [**8-12**] started on fludrocort in addition
   - s/p another 1 unit pRBC yesterday
   - off levofed
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis, added vancomycin  in the setting of possible
   new infiltrate on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or
   alternatively and more likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking
   deep breaths secondary to pain
   -blood cultures now growing yeast unspeciated in one bottle - consider
   adding anti-fungal coverage in addition
   -mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan given multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and immune suppression pending
   - SvO2 yesterday 61
   - EKG from [**8-11**] - ST-T wave configuration suggests acute
   injury/possible pericarditis
   Clinical correlation is suggested. Since previous tracing of the same
   date, no significant change
   - repeat echo [**8-12**] - Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is a very small
   circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   - chest x-ray from [**8-12**] - FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-11**],
   there is little change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
   silhouette since the study of [**8-10**]. This is consistent with the small
   pericardial effusion seen on the CT scan of [**8-10**]. Left pleural effusion
   and retrocardiac opacification persists. Right central catheter remains
   in place.
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin for
   neutropenic prophylaxis.
   .# GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   - cont to follow new onc recs
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with repeated episode of chest pain in the same
   locatin which is worse with inspiration.  Pain is concerning for
   pericarditis, the patient also has a small but new pericardial effusion
   on chest CT and echo.  Also with diffuse ST segment changes.
   Hypotensive but pulsus is 4 and echo is negative for any signs of
   tamponade on 2 consecutive echos.  Pain may also be secondary to
   esophageal spasms in the setting of gastric ulcer and radiation,
   however this clinically does not fit with hypotension.   Another
   possibility is that patient is anxious and this represents a
   manifestation of that, however again this doesn
t clinically fit with
   hypotesnsion. Pain may also be related to gastric process. Enzymes
   negative. Tylenol changed to PRN with LFT abnormalities, cannot give
   aspirin secondary to thrombocytopenia.
   - final read CTA
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Interval development of small pericardial effusion.
   2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
   3. Redemonstration of confluent soft tissue mass that appears to arise
   from
   the lesser curvature of the stomach and extends to surround the celiac
   axis,
   4. Left adrenal mass.
   5. Hypoattenuating splenic lesion stable.
   - cont oxycodone and tylenol PRN for pain

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who presents with chest pain and hypotension during platelet transfusion. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis versus adrenal insufficiency. The patient has received multiple treatment courses for DLBCL, which has progressed despite therapy. She has been on steroids in the past for chemotherapy.

24-hour events:
- Transthoracic echo performed at 04:21 PM, with repeat echo done yesterday due to concern over possible tamponade. Onc recommended checking LFTs as well. Levofed was discontinued yesterday after transfusion of another unit of packed red blood cells (CvO2 61%). The patient remained off pressors overnight with stable blood pressures. One blood culture is now positive for yeast. The patient reports improvement in chest pain, now stating further down in her abdomen where her more typical pain is. No shortness of breath or abdominal pain is reported. The patient tolerates oral liquids such as Ensure.

Allergies:
- Skin reaction to cefepime
- Rash from the last dose of antibiotics (vancomycin)

Infusions:
- Pantoprazole (Protonix) started at 08:00 PM on [**2133-8-12**]

   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes septic, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency.  Patient now with + blood culture for [**Female First Name (un) 474**].  Given
   neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo which was repeated
   yesterday. Cortisol level prior to [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was 3 which is low.
   With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which indicates likely relative adrenal
   insufficiency in a patient who has been on steroids in the past for
   chemotherapy.
   - on stress dose hydrocortisone started evening of [**8-11**], also suspect
   that iv steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical
   evidence of pericarditis, also on [**8-12**] started on fludrocort in
   addition
   - s/p another 1 unit pRBC yesterday
   - off levofed since yesterday PM
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis, added vancomycin  in the setting of possible
   new infiltrate on chest x-ray, however given + blood culture for
   [**Female First Name (un) 474**] will d/c anti-bacterial agents at this time
   - start caspofugin 70 IV today, then 50 IV q daily starting tomorrow
   morning for [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans
   - SvO2 yesterday 61
   - repeat echo [**8-12**] - Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency or anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and
   magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with
   IV magnesium however this was prolonged and after the infusion had
   stopped and the hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills /
   rigors or other symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but
   had also rec'd 10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.
   Transfusion reaction would not be expected to cause hypotension unless
   it were of an anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such
   as respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect
   clinically pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level
   measured yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which
   indicates likely relative adrenal insufficiency in a patient who has
   been on steroids in the past for chemotherapy.
   - on stress dose hydrocortisone started PM [**8-11**], also suspect that iv
   steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical evidence
   of pericarditis, also on [**8-12**] started on fludrocort in addition
   - s/p another 1 unit pRBC yesterday
   - off levofed
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis, added vancomycin  in the setting of possible
   new infiltrate on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or
   alternatively and more likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking
   deep breaths secondary to pain
   -blood cultures now growing yeast unspeciated in one bottle - consider
   adding anti-fungal coverage in addition
   -mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan given multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and immune suppression pending
   - SvO2 yesterday 61
   - EKG from [**8-11**] - ST-T wave configuration suggests acute
   injury/possible pericarditis
   Clinical correlation is suggested. Since previous tracing of the same
   date, no significant change
   - repeat echo [**8-12**] - Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is a very small
   circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   - chest x-ray from [**8-12**] - FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-11**],
   there is little change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
   silhouette since the study of [**8-10**]. This is consistent with the small
   pericardial effusion seen on the CT scan of [**8-10**]. Left pleural effusion
   and retrocardiac opacification persists. Right central catheter remains
   in place.
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin for
   neutropenic prophylaxis.
   .# GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.

   Imaging: CXR-Patient with evolution of bilateral peri-hilar fullness
   and suggestion of right sided effusion on film today.
   Microbiology: Blood Culture--single positive for yeast
   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo female admit with chest pain and paroxysms of hypotension
   requiring IV pressor support.  She did have recurrence of hypotension
   here which has been responsive to increased volume and ECHO, ECG and
   cardiac enzymes have failed to show clear evidence of myocardial or
   peri-cardial insult.
   1)Hypotension-
   -Will follow up culture results
   -Vanco/Cefepime
   -Hydrocortison/Fludricortisone started but role in sustaining BP is not
   clear
the argument is that cortisol was low initially and slow taper is
   suggested
   -Will treat for fungal infection with suggestion of candidemia as
   potential player-Caspofungin
   -
   2)Chest Pain-No evidence of myocardial injury or pericardial
   restriction or effusion on repeat ECHO.  [**Month (only) 8**] be GI related either with
   spasm or gastritis but would not explain the hypotension clearly.
   -She does have dyspnea
subtle this morning
and some pulmonary edema
   noted on CXR
   -Move to negative fluid balance today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female admitted to the ICU with chest pain and episodes of hypotension requiring IV pressor support. She has a history of allergies to cefepime and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/63 mmHg to 91/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She has been on levophed, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for fatigue and anemia. The patient's flow sheet data shows a balance of fluids, and she is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device. On physical examination, she appears alert, has symmetric chest expansion and resonant percussion notes, and her extremities show trace edema. Neurological examination reveals that she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals bilateral peri-hilar fullness and a right-sided effusion on chest X-ray. Blood culture results indicate a positive yeast infection. The patient's assessment and plan include treating for fungal infection with caspofungin, managing hypotension, addressing chest pain, and providing ICU care. Potential medical complications that"
