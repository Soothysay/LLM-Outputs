","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. They have been experiencing chest tightness, cough, wheezing, agitation, and tremors. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/65 mmHg to 140/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient has received Valium 100 mg PO over the last 24 hours and an additional 20 mg IV this morning. They also received ciprofloxacin at 05:29 PM on 09/16/2102. The patient is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium for DVT and stress ulcer prevention. Their lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's troponin-T levels are below the detection limit, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient's physical examination reveals diaphoresis and wheezing throughout the chest. The patient is attentive but not fully assessed neurologically. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of depression, bipolar disease, COPD, and active cigarette use. She was admitted to the ICU for ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal and active suicidality. The patient required 120 mg of Valium in the past 24 hours due to ETOH withdrawal symptoms such as tremor and tachycardia. Serum and urine toxicology tests were negative, except for benzos which she received in the hospital.

The patient has a history of ETOH withdrawal seizures in the past. She is currently being treated with Valium 10mg PO Q1hr for CIWA (>10) with PRN bolus if needed, MVI, thiamine, folic acid, fall precautions, and a social work consult for substance abuse counseling.

The patient also exhibits active suicidality, with a history of depression/bipolar disease and this episode being in the context of inquiring about her brother's death by suicide. She is sectioned so she cannot leave against medical advice. She will continue taking home Lexapro and Seroquel, and a psychiatric consult has been called but not yet seen. Another social work consult is planned.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) on day [**2-5**] of ciprofloxacin, and E. coli sensitivities are pending. She also has COPD, with wheezes on examination"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of depression, bipolar disease, COPD, and active cigarette use. She was admitted to the ICU for ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal and active suicidality. The patient's current condition includes ongoing diarrhea, agitation, and a desire to leave the hospital. She required 80 mg of diazepam for ETOH withdrawal symptoms, but her need decreased overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable with a slight tremor and tachycardia. Her labs show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, creatinine, and electrolytes. However, her platelet count is slightly low. The patient is currently on various medications including diazepam, citalopram, and quetiapine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of ETOH withdrawal seizures and is currently experiencing symptoms such as tremors and tachycardia. She requires close monitoring for any signs of worsening withdrawal symptoms or seizures.
2. Suicidality: The patient has a history of depression and bipolar disorder, and she is currently experiencing active suicidality. She has expressed a desire to leave the hospital, which poses a risk for self-harm or suicide. Close monitoring and appropriate psychiatric interventions are necessary to manage this risk.
3. UTI: The patient had a recent urinary tract infection (UTI) while on ciprofloxacin."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has a history of ongoing diarrhea. Stool analysis for C. diff has been sent. The patient was evaluated by a psychiatrist who recommended a 1:1 sitter for 24 hours and changing the medication from Lexapro to Celexa due to cost considerations. The patient required an increased dose of diazepam yesterday but showed a decrease in need overnight.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 85 bpm (84-108 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 91/64 mmHg to 130/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (12-21 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 543 mL, including 480 mL through the oral route, 63 mL intravenously, and 0 mL through total fluids. The total output is 1100 mL, consisting of 1100 mL through urine. The overall fluid balance is negative by 558 mL.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of depression, bipolar disease, COPD, and active cigarette use. She was admitted to the ICU for ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal and active suicidality. The patient has been experiencing ongoing diarrhea, and a stool test for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) came back negative. The patient required 80 mg of diazepam yesterday but had a decreased need overnight.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), a heart rate of 85 bpm (84-108 bpm), a blood pressure of 91/64 mmHg (70 mmHg range), a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (12-21 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's height is 68 inches, and her weight is not provided.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 543 mL, with 480 mL given through the oral route, 63 mL through intravenous fluids, and 0 mL of blood products. Output includes 1,100 mL of urine, 0 mL of NG (nasogastric) output, 0 mL of stool, and 0 mL of drain output. The fluid balance is -558 mL.

The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and an SpO2 of 94%. ABG results are not available. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment, all of which were not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.1-5.6 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 92 mg/dL, a platelet count of 168 K/uL, a creatinine level of 0.6-0.4 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels below 0.01 ng/mL. Other lab values include sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride of 101 mEq/L, calcium of 8.5 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL, and phosphate of 3.1 mg/dL. Additionally, albumin is at 3.9 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is 199 IU/L, and liver enzymes are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include management for ETOH withdrawal, active suicidality, urinary tract infection (UTI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular issues, nutritional needs, access for medication administration, pain management, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention, and code status. The patient is currently on a regular diet and is set up for pain management with Tylenol. She is also receiving MVI (multivitamins), thiamine, and folic acid. The patient is on a fall precaution, and a social work consult for substance abuse counseling has been ordered.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ETOH withdrawal: The patient requires close monitoring for symptoms such as seizures, tremors, tachycardia, and agitation. Valium has been prescribed to manage symptoms, but the patient's CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure) score should be regularly assessed and managed accordingly.
2. Active suicidality: The patient should continue to receive one-on-one sitter observation due to the high risk of suicide. Psychiatric follow-up recommendations should be implemented, and the patient's compliance with psychiatric medications should be monitored.
3. UTI: Since the patient is on ciprofloxacin, there is a risk of developing antibiotic-associated diarrhea or C. diff infection. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, urinary urgency, and increased frequency of urination is essential.
4. COPD exacerbation: Given the patient's smoking history and wheezing on examination, it is crucial to monitor her respiratory status closely. Nebulizer treatments and bronchodilators should be provided as needed, and smoking cessation strategies should be discussed.
5. Cardiovascular issues: The patient had a T-wave inversion episode, which was ruled out for myocardial infarction. Daily aspirin has been prescribed, and a stress test is recommended for further cardiac evaluation.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status should"
