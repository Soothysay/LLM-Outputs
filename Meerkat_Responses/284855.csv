   69M with CAD, CHF and MDS p/w hypotension, anemia, guaiac positive
   stool.
   #  GIB:  There was one report of black stool, which is suspicious for
   upper GI source.  Ddx includes PUD, gastritis.  On ED exam, rectal exam
   was gross blood, which could indicate brisk upper bleed versus lower
   source, ddx includes AVMs, diverticula, mass, hemorrhoids.  Pt has been
   hemodynamically stable since initial resuscitation. No further bleeding
   episodes in ICU.
   -GI c/s appreciated. Plan to EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday, NPO after MN sunday
   with clears during day and golytely prep.
   -Hold coumadin, give 1 dose vitamin K to reverse. No FFP unless
   re-bleeds or hemodynamically unstable.
   -Given significant cardiac history will continue ASA at lower dose
   (81mg daily) and clopidogrel.
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -H. pylori antibody
   -Surgery aware
   -2 PIVs in place
   -Q8 hour Hcts
   -Transfuse to goal of 30, hct after first unit PRBCs 25.5, will give
   another unit tonight and re-check.
   #  Hypotension.  Unclear how acute this is. The patient is not
   symptomatic with his low blood pressure in terms of lightheadedness or
   syncope.  BPs 90/40 at last clinic visit, this may be in part due to
   GIB as well as increase in ACEI and lasix recently
   -hold lasix and ACEI tonight, restart lasix preferentially, possibly in
   AM if stable overnight, may do more urgently if develops more fluid
   overload.
   -Consider decreased dose ACEI for discharge if it is re-started.
   -GIB management per above.
   -hold nitro patch for now.
   #  Anemia - Pt has known MDS and B12 deficiency with baseline HCT
   29-30.  Acute drop to 24.4 since [**5-29**] in setting of GIB.
   -transfuse per above
   -o/p f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 322**] for continued EPO and B12 injections.
   #  CAD. Prior CABG and last PCI at OSH 15 months ago.  Having some
   increased incidence of jaw pain which pt recognizes as anginal
   equivalent. No active jaw pain or chest discomfort since admission. CEs
   normal initially with unremarkable ECG.  No current evidence for active
   ischemia, but is high risk in setting of prior coronary disease and
   anemia.
   -continue ASA and plavix, if bleeds or is unstable can reverse with
   platelets.
   -Continue BB
   -CEs tonight and in AM.
   -d/c nitro patch given hypotension as above. Can use SL nitro prn if
   necessary.
   # [**Last Name (un) **] - acute on chronic renal insufficiency with baseline cr 1.5-1.6,
   recently 1.9. 2.3 on admission down to 2.2. Suspect chronic progressive
   renal disease with superimposed injury from hypotension/hypoperfusion.
   -Monitor after blood, hydration today
   -hold ACEI
   -monitor.
   # FEN: Lytes with am labs.  Low sodium cardiac diet.  Bolus PRN to keep
   systolic BP >90, UOP >30.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and myelodysplastic syndrome. He presented with hypotension, anemia, and guaiac positive stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has been hemodynamically stable since initial resuscitation and no further bleeding episodes have occurred in the ICU. 

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. BradyCardia: The patient's heart rate is low at 52 beats per minute.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed (GIB): The patient has black stool, which is suspicious for an upper GI source. Differential diagnoses include peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastritis. A rectal exam showed gross blood, suggesting a possible upper or lower source of bleeding. Diagnostic options include a GI consultation and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on Monday. The patient will be NPO after midnight on Sunday, with clear liquids during the day and a Golytely prep. Coumadin will be held, and one dose of vitamin K will be given to reverse its effects. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will only be administered if there is re-bleeding or if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. The patient will continue taking aspirin at a lower dose (81mg daily) and clopidogrel due to his significant cardiac history. An H. pylori antibody test"

   #  GIB:  There was one report of black stool, which is suspicious for
   upper GI source.  Ddx includes PUD, gastritis.  On ED exam, rectal exam
   was gross blood, which could indicate brisk upper bleed versus lower
   source, ddx includes AVMs, diverticula, mass, hemorrhoids.  Pt has been
   hemodynamically stable since initial resuscitation. No further bleeding
   episodes in ICU.
   -GI c/s appreciated. Plan to EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] on Monday, NPO after MN sunday
   with clears during day and golytely prep.
   -Hold coumadin, give 1 dose vitamin K to reverse. No FFP unless
   re-bleeds or hemodynamically unstable.
   -Given significant cardiac history will continue ASA at lower dose
   (81mg daily) and clopidogrel.
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -H. pylori antibody
   -Surgery aware
   -2 PIVs in place
   -Q8 hour Hcts
   -Transfuse to goal of 30, hct after first unit PRBCs 25.5, will give
   another unit tonight and re-check.
   #  Hypotension.  Unclear how acute this is. The patient is not
   symptomatic with his low blood pressure in terms of lightheadedness or
   syncope.  BPs 90/40 at last clinic visit, this may be in part due to
   GIB as well as increase in ACEI and lasix recently
   -hold lasix and ACEI tonight, restart lasix preferentially, possibly in
   AM if stable overnight, may do more urgently if develops more fluid
   overload.
   -Consider decreased dose ACEI for discharge if it is re-started.
   -GIB management per above.
   -hold nitro patch for now.
   #  Anemia - Pt has known MDS and B12 deficiency with baseline HCT
   29-30.  Acute drop to 24.4 since [**5-29**] in setting of GIB.
   -transfuse per above
   -o/p f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 322**] for continued EPO and B12 injections.
   #  CAD. Prior CABG and last PCI at OSH 15 months ago.  Having some
   increased incidence of jaw pain which pt recognizes as anginal
   equivalent. No active jaw pain or chest discomfort since admission. CEs
   normal initially with unremarkable ECG.  No current evidence for active
   ischemia, but is high risk in setting of prior coronary disease and
   anemia.
   -continue ASA and plavix, if bleeds or is unstable can reverse with
   platelets.
   -Continue BB
   -CEs tonight and in AM.
   -d/c nitro patch given hypotension as above. Can use SL nitro prn if
   necessary.
   # [**Last Name (un) **] - acute on chronic renal insufficiency with baseline cr 1.5-1.6,
   recently 1.9. 2.3 on admission down to 2.2. Suspect chronic progressive
   renal disease with superimposed injury from hypotension/hypoperfusion.
   -Monitor after blood, hydration today
   -hold ACEI
   -monitor.
   # FEN: Lytes with am labs.  Low sodium cardiac diet.  Bolus PRN to keep

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). He presented with hypotension, anemia, and guaiac positive stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has been stable since initial resuscitation, but further bleeding episodes in the ICU have been ruled out.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/38 to 125/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a regular rate and rhythm. Physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva, moist mucous membranes, clear lungs, a regular cardiac rhythm with normal S1 and S2, and a late systolic murmur. The abdomen is described as obese but soft, with normoactive bowel sounds and no rebound/guarding. The patient also has prominent non-pitting lower extremity edema, which has not changed from baseline.

Laboratory results show an increase in hematocrit from 25.5% to 26.2% over the past day, with troponin-T levels at 0.01. Other labs, including CK, CKMB, and troponin-T, are within normal ranges"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with hypotension, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been hemodynamically stable since initial resuscitation, with no further bleeding reported. However, the patient's hematocrit has not responded well to blood transfusions.

The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) in preparation for possible gastrointestinal (GI) scope today. His Coumadin was held and he was given vitamin K to reverse its effects. The patient's aspirin and Plavix were initially continued due to his cardiac history but were later held because of the lack of improvement in hematocrit levels. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be given, and IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will continue. Hematocrits will be followed up every 6 hours.

The patient also has hypotension, likely caused by gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of increased Lasix and ACEi use. These medications have been held. The patient's anemia is related to his history of myelodysplastic syndrome and vitamin B12 deficiency. His baseline hematocrit was around 30, and now it is 24.4. The patient will be transfused with blood.

The patient has a history of CAD and recently experienced jaw pain,"

   Critical Care
   I have seen and examined the patient, and was physically present with
   the ICU team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree
   with the note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   His INR is down to 1.7 and Hct stable at 29 after 4 units of pRBC
   His stool output is brown and he is now on clears. He will begin prep
   for EGD and colonoscopy for tomorrow. Other medications including PO
   lasix will be started today to help with edema and mild desaturation
   with exertion. He will leave the ICU today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with hypotension, anemia, and guaiac positive stool. The patient has been hemodynamically stable, with repeat Hcts being fairly stable. He is on a clear liquid diet and is expected to undergo gastrointestinal (GI) procedures such as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy next week. The patient has been given vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse the elevated INR of 1.8. Medications such as aspirin and clopidogrel have been held due to bleeding. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is being continued for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) is being monitored, and renal function is improving with blood and fluids. The patient's anemia is attributed to his history of MDS and B12 deficiency, with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) of around 30%. His baseline creatinine (Cr) levels were 1.5-1.6, which increased to 2.3 on admission and now stands at 1.7. The patient has experienced some jaw pain, considered an anginal equivalent, but has not had this pain since being in the hospital. Coron"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with hypotension, anemia, and guaiac positive stool. He was initially resuscitated and is currently hemodynamically stable. His hematocrit has not responded well to blood transfusions, and he has been kept NPO (nothing by mouth) for possible endoscopy. His Coumadin was reversed with vitamin K, and he has been given fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and continued on IV pantoprazole (Protonix). Further evaluation of H. pylori antibodies and frequent monitoring of hematocrits are planned. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), renal failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and pain control issues."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and myelodysplastic syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been hemodynamically stable with repeat Hcts being stable, on clear liquids, and awaiting GI scope on Monday. He has received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma to reverse INR to 1.8. Medications such as aspirin and Plavix have been held due to the bleed.

Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, which is indicated by a positive guaiac test and hypotension. The bleeding is likely due to increased Lasix and ACE inhibitor use.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to the gastrointestinal bleeding and increased Lasix and ACE inhibitor use.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome and B12 deficiency with a baseline hematocrit of approximately 30%. His current hematocrit level is 29.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and recently experienced jaw pain, an anginal equivalent. This pain has not recurred since being in the hospital.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.5-"
