","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a chief complaint of bowel perforation. She underwent an inguinal hernia repair one week ago and developed worsening abdominal pain, which led to the concern for bowel obstruction and perforation. A transverse colectomy was performed, and drains were placed two days ago, producing significant bilious fluid. The surgeons are worried about a new small bowel perforation and peritonitis.

The patient also has a history of hypertension, colon cancer status post resection, breast cancer resection, and radiation therapy. She is currently intermittently in atrial fibrillation and complains of abdominal pain.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 103/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. She is receiving metoprolol and diltiazem infusions. Her fluid balance is negative 1,010 mL since midnight, and she has received a total of 120 mL of intravenous fluids.

Physical examination reveals tenderness in the left lower quadrant, as well as the ostomy and Jackson-Pratt drains. Her breath sounds are clear, but she has not been assessed for peripheral pulses, movement, tone, or skin condition.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 31.1 K/uL, hematocrit of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of bowel perforation, recent inguinal hernia repair, transverse colectomy, and intermittent atrial fibrillation. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. She has been experiencing worsening abdominal pain, and imaging and examination suggest bowel obstruction and perforation. Surgeons are concerned about a new small bowel perforation and peritonitis. The patient also has a history of hypertension, colon cancer status post resection, breast cancer resection, and radiation therapy. She has no known drug allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bowel perforation with peritonitis: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings indicate the possibility of a second bowel perforation, which can lead to peritonitis. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation level (95%) suggests hypoxemia. This could be due to atelectasis and volume overload. Close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support may be necessary.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has intermittent atrial fibrillation. It is important to manage this cardiac arrhythmia to prevent complications such as stroke or further hemodynamic instability.
4. Infection: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics, indicating a concern for infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is crucial.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a significant negative fluid balance of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of recent left hernia repair and subsequent colostomy for bowel perforation. She was transferred from another hospital with abdominal pain, elevated white blood cell count, and bilious fluid in the abdominal drains. The patient's abdomen is acutely tender in the lower left quadrant, and she has a small right pleural effusion on chest X-ray. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, unclear history of myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently being treated with diltiazem, metoprolol, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely secondary to infection in the peritoneal cavity and possible obstruction. This could lead to further complications such as perforation or peritonitis.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count is likely related to the abdominal infection and possible bowel perforation. If left untreated, it could progress to sepsis or develop into another infection.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may worsen, potentially leading to hemodynamic instability or thromboembolic events.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may indicate underlying respiratory issues such as pneumonia, aspiration, or effusions from abdominal inflammation."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of hypertension and colon cancer, who underwent a colectomy due to significant bowel obstruction.
