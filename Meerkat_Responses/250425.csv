","Summary of the patient's progress note in the ICU:

The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to their improved mental status. They were extubated later in the day and remained stable overnight. The patient has allergies to amoxicillin and adhesive bandages, and they have a rash reaction to both. There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history mentioned.

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the addition of hyponatremia, which is currently being addressed by restricting oral fluid intake and rechecking labs. The sodium level has improved from 120 to 122.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/67 to 138/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight remains unchanged at 78.6 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 680 mL and output of 730 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 50 mL. Respiratory support is provided through CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume of 600 mL and spontaneous tidal volume of 1022 mL. The patient's oxygen delivery device is a nasal cannula, and the FiO2 is set at 50%.

Physical examination findings are not assessed in various areas, including peripheral vascular, skin,"

   # Recurrent altered mental status: DDX includes infection (less likely
   given this is the third episode in the last few weeks and work up for
   infection has been negative, currently leukocytosis or fevers), stroke
   or head bleed (unlikely for similar reason and prior CT x2 and MRI
   brain all negative), encephalopathy (likely), hyponatremia (could be
   contributing given sodium of 120 is lower than he has been given he
   restarted diuretics yesterday), sleep disorder (given all episodes
   occur first thing in the AM).
   -for hepatic encephalopathy- dose lactulose q2hrs until bowel movements
   then back down with goal bowel movements 5-6 per day, continue
   rifaximine
   -for hyponatremia- repeat labs in 4 hrs. If still hyponatremic, will
   need repletion. Hold diuretics.
   -sleep disorder- continuous oxygen monitoring, ABG when awake and
   extubated for baseline. sleep study needed but may not be able to do in
   house on the weekend. Consider auto titrating CPAP.
   -infection- unlikely but could consider diagnostic para if not
   improving. Two diagnostic [**Doctor First Name 3619**] this admission were negative
   # alkylosis: Would think with altered mental status, that his CO2 would
   be high causing an acidosis not alkylosis with low CO2. Could imply a
   sleep disturbance as cause. See above.
   -monitor ABG
   -currently changing to PS ventilation and will resend ABG in 30 mins.

   -has been extubated quickly on prior episodes.
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   -continue lactulose as above, continue rifaximine
   -hold diuretics
   -continue ppx cipro for SBP
   -follow up hepatology recs
   # Pulmonary HTN: continue sildenafil. [**Month (only) 51**] not be able to get iloprost

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), and hypothyroidism. He presented with his third episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, hyponatremia, and a potential sleep disorder. He is currently on lactulose, rifaximine, and sildenafil. The plan includes monitoring ABG (arterial blood gas), changing to PS ventilation, and weaning off the ventilator as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Although the workup for infection has been negative, it should still be considered as a possible complication due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
2. Stroke or head bleed: Previous CT x2 and MRI brain were negative, but recurrent altered mental status could be indicative of a stroke or head bleed. Further evaluation may be necessary.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, which can contribute to altered mental status. Treatment with lactulose and rifaximine is appropriate, but monitoring for worsening symptoms is crucial.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which can cause altered mental status. Repeating labs and repletion of sodium if still hyponatremic are necessary. Holding diuretics may also be needed.
5. Sleep disorder"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), and hypothyroidism. He presented with his third episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient's abdominal pain resolved after bowel movements, and a CT scan showed no evidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO), although ascites were present. His mental status has improved, and he is currently extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent Altered Mental Status: The differential diagnosis includes infection, stroke or head bleed, encephalopathy, hyponatremia, and sleep disorder. The most likely cause is hepatic encephalopathy, for which lactulose is prescribed every 2 hours until bowel movements are achieved, then reduced to maintain 5-6 bowel movements per day. Rifaximine will also be continued.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low at 120 mEq/L. Diuretics have been restarted, and it is planned to check potassium levels in the evening.

3. Sleep Disorder: Continuous oxygen monitoring and an ABG when awake and extubated are recommended. A sleep study is needed but may not be feasible at the moment. Consideration should be given to auto-titrating CPAP.

4. Infection: Although infection is less likely, it should be considered if the patient does not improve"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and required invasive ventilation. They were successfully extubated but experienced abdominal pain, which is concerning for small bowel obstruction (SBO) or ileus. The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and is at risk for varices and portal hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly elevated heart rate. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 50 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's laboratory results indicate alkalosis, hepatic encephalopathy, hypotension, and pulmonary hypertension. The plan includes obtaining an abdominal CT to assess for SBO or ileus, consulting surgery, initiating treatment for pulmonary hypertension, correcting hypotension, managing cirrhosis, and advancing nutrition. The patient's ICU care includes glycemic control, line management, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and communication with hepatology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SBO/Ileus: The patient's abdominal pain and concerns for SBO versus ileus need to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension needs to be managed to prevent complications like right heart strain or failure.
3. HypoNatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need to be corrected carefully to prevent dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, which was stopped without difficulty. The patient is now extubated and not using BIPAP overnight. He complains of abdominal pain, and there are concerns for small bowel obstruction (SBO) versus ileus. An abdominal CT scan and surgical consult have been planned. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and adhesive bandage (topical), as well as previous admissions for cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic hepatitis, pulmonary hypertension, and other medical conditions.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Ileus/SBO: The patient's abdominal pain and lack of bowel movements raise concerns for ileus or SBO. An abdominal CT scan and surgical consult will be obtained to further evaluate the situation. Nasogastric tube (NGT) placement may be considered if there is worsening of symptoms or if the CT scan shows a more concerning picture.
2. pHTN: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which is likely exacerbated by his NPO (nothing by mouth) status. He will be started on iloprost and will restart sildenafil as soon as possible.
3. HypoNatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, likely due to dehydration. He will be given normal saline (NS) at 100 cc/hr, and his sodium levels will be repeated this afternoon to ensure they are rising.
4. Cirrhosis: Once the abdominal CT scan does not show complete obstruction, the patient will be given lactulose to manage his cirrhosis.
Other issues will be addressed according to the housestaff notes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial chief complaint and primary concern is respiratory failure. If proper ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained, this could lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's abdominal pain and lack of bowel movements raise concerns for SBO. If left untreated or undiagnosed, SBO can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, and sepsis.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and current symptoms may predispose him to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status, confusion, and other cognitive impairments.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a pre-existing condition of pulmonary hypertension. If not managed appropriately, this could worsen his respiratory status and lead to right heart strain and failure.
5. HypoNatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need to be corrected to prevent potential complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infection: Given the patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures, he is at increased risk for developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections."

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism. He presented with his third episode of altered mental status, requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient also had abdominal pain, which was initially concerning for small bowel obstruction (SBO) but resolved after bowel movements. A CT scan showed no evidence of SBO but did reveal ascites. 

Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is currently improved, but there is a possibility of recurrent episodes. Differential diagnoses include infection, stroke or head bleed, encephalopathy, hyponatremia, and sleep disorder. Treatment includes lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, holding diuretics for hyponatremia, and considering a sleep study.
2. Abdominal pain/SBO: The pain has resolved after bowel movements, indicating no evidence of SBO. However, the presence of ascites should be monitored.
3. ESLD: The patient has ESLD due to Hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis. Management includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin, holding diuretics, and prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 41 yo M with pulmonary hypertension, ESLD on transplant list with
   Hep C cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hypothyroidism who presents with
   his third episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for
   airway protection.
   # Abdominal pain: Resolved.  Likely secondary to severe constipation.
   After drinking contrast patient had large volume stool output.  CT scan
   preliminarily no SBO, but ascities present.  Abdominal pain now
   resolved after BMs.
   - follow-up final CT abd/pelvis read
   # Recurrent altered mental status: Mental status currently at
   baseline.  Unclear why the patient continues to have these episodes of
   AMS that resolve quickly.  Per report he had been taking his lactulose
   on the floor prior to intubation.  No evidence for infections, stroke
   or intracranial hemorrhage.  Hyponatremia is stable and patient is
   currently mentating at baseline so likely not the explanation.  The
   patient could have a sleep disorder, though maintained his O2 sats
   throughout the night on telemetry monitoring.  Possible alkalosis
   evidence for this thus far.
   -Lactulose with goal of [**4-25**] BMs/day + rifaximine for hepatic
   encephalopathy prevention
   -for hyponatremia- see below
   -sleep disorder- ABG this am for baseline.  Needs sleep study.
   Consider auto titrating CPAP.
   -infection- unlikely but could consider diagnostic para if not
   improving. Two diagnostic [**Doctor First Name 3619**] this admission were negative
   # Hyponatremia: Stable in the low 120s.  Has been in the low 130s
   previously on this admission.  Patient got increased volume yesterday
   secondary to drinking PO contrast.
   - decrease fluid restriction to 1.2L
   # ESLD: Hep C and alcohol cirrhosis.
   -continue lactulose as above, continue rifaximine
   -hold diuretics
   -continue ppx cipro for SBP
   -follow up hepatology recs
   # Pulmonary HTN: continue sildenafil and iloprost.
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   # FEN: Low Na diet. Fluid restriction 1.2L.  Monitor lytes as above
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, PPI per home reg, bowel reg as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension, end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list due to Hep C cirrhosis and alcoholic cirrhosis, as well as hypothyroidism. He presented with his third episode of altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection. The patient has had episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent altered mental status, hyponatremia, and ESLD. He is currently receiving various treatments including lactulose, rifaximine, sildenafil, iloprost, levothyroxine, and prophylactic medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's ESLD and recurrent episodes of altered mental status indicate a risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring liver function tests and maintaining medication compliance is crucial.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and coma. Close monitoring of sodium levels and adjustment of fluid intake may be necessary.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's existing condition of pulmonary hypertension increases the risk of complications related to respiratory function. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and ensuring proper medication administration is essential.
4. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to ESLD, there is a higher risk of infections. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory values, and prompt treatment of any signs of infection are important"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a known history of cirrhosis. He was previously intubated but has now been extubated and is showing signs of improvement, including an improving mental status after receiving lactulose therapy and resuming active bowel movements. The patient has been diagnosed with encephalopathy, ascites, respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, and abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can cause confusion, altered level of consciousness, and other cognitive impairments. It may worsen if the patient does not continue lactulose therapy or if there is a recurrence of infections.
2. Ascites: The accumulation of fluid in the abdomen can lead to respiratory complications, such as difficulty breathing or pneumonia. Monitoring for recurrent fevers and considering a tap of fluid for further evaluation might be necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function should be closely monitored, especially considering the possibility of pulmonary hypertension and potential worsening of hypoxemia. Limited polysomnography (PSG) upon transfer to the floor may help assess sleep-related issues like REM sleep vulnerability. BIPAP may be considered if there is worsening of respiratory status.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, porto-pulmonary hypertension is likely. This condition can cause increased resistance in pulmonary circulation, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Further evaluation and management are"
