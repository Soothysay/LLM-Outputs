   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old Portuguese-speaking man with end-stage liver
   disease and stenosed TIPS, recurrent admissions for hepatic
   encephalopathy, now here with abdominal pain and a WBC of 21.3 with a
   neutrophil predominance.
 ASCITES
   Likely related to massive ascites [**1-23**] likely hepatorenal syndrome. No
   evidence of SBP given low WBC on diagnostic tap; tap appears bloody;
   most likely [**1-23**] coagulopathy, though consistent appearance of this
   finding might suggest hemoperitoneum from another process rather than
   from trauma from tap; CT apparently offers no obvious suspect. No sign
   of perf on CT scan. Surgery evaluating per ED request. Possible gastric
   outlet obstruction seen on CT scan; may improve w decrease in ascitic
   fluid.
   - appreciate surgery recs; tplant [**Doctor First Name **] service will follow
   - will give albumin per liver recs p HD per renal recs; albumin will
   also be provided by FFP needed for HD line placement
   - consider tx tap if renal function improves
   - NGT if not tolerating clears, emesis, etc
   - clear liquid diet for now
 Leukocytosis
   Unclear source. Concern for abdominal source but as above this is not
   clear after dx tap and CT abd/pelvis. I am underwhelmed by CXR but do
   make note of RLL opacity; hard to account for this degree of WBC with
   this small PNA though relative immune suppression of liver/renal
   failure may diminish inflammatory response. High WBC out of proportion
   to symptoms, with abd pain, in pt w multiple hospitalizations, raises
   special concern for c. diff though obvious colitis not seen on CT.
   - covering gram-negatives w zosyn; add vanco and flagyl if worsening
   - Bcx, Ucx pending
   - send c. diff given mult recent hospitalizations
 LIVER CIRRHOSIS, ETOH, w/ encephalopathy
   Hepatorenal syndrome worsens prognosis. Could have been precipitated by
   large volume tap on prior admission, though pt has tolerated similar
   (~5L) in the past. (Note: I initially believed this to have been 10L,
   this was in fact ~5L). Pt has been on transplant list. MELD on
   admission =  41.
   - abd U/S w doppler to eval TIPS stenosis, eval portal circulation
   - daily MELD labs
   - transplant surgery and liver services following, appreciate recs
   - octreotide and midodrine
   - regular lactulose at home dose
   - continue home rifaximin
   - PPI
   - will restart pt's outpt propranolol after completion of HD and
   stabilization of BP
   - hold pt's home diuretics
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely [**1-23**] hepatorenal syndrome, perhaps [**1-23**] large volume tap on last
   admission; vs change in hemodynamics [**1-23**] infection. FeNa on admission
   0.6.
   - HD tonight per renal, appreciate renal involvement and placement of
   HD line w VIP port
   - holding metformin
   - continue midodrine, Octreotide
   - f/u Bcx, Ucx as above
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Per family report, patient currently appears to have intact MS,
   however, appears confused at times, with mumbling and groaning on.
   Possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy (NH3 = 66 on admission) vs
   infection, UTI vs SBP, vs acidemia. Remains afebrile
   - Be alert for harmful behavior, use soft restraints if pt begins to
   pull on lines
   - lactulose 30mg PO TID
   - await fluid results from paracentesis, including gram stain, WBC, and
   cx
   - UA
   - holding metforming for lactic acidosis
   - trend lactate
 LACTIC ACIDOSIS
   Most likely [**1-23**] liver failure itself, though metformin toxicity in
   setting of new renal failure may also be responsible. Mesenteric
   ischemia could be culprit; no positive evidence for this at this point,
   but should follow closely.
   - Abd U/S w doppler as above
   - holding metformin and follow lactate as above.
   - follow lactate
   - guaiac stool
 DIABETES
   Holding oral antihyperglycemics based on low blood sugar in ED today.
   ISS alone for now. Has had more issues with high blood sugar than low
   in the past.
   - cont. ISS
   - check FSBG
 COAGULOPATHY
   Assoc w liver failure. Got 6U FFP for HD line placement. Holding
   coumadin for now.
   - continue to trend coags
   - give vit K for goal INR <2.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of end-stage liver disease, stenosed TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), recurrent admissions for hepatic encephalopathy, and now presenting with abdominal pain and a high white blood cell count. He has massive ascites likely due to hepatorenal syndrome, no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and a bloody ascitic fluid tap. There is also a concern for gastric outlet obstruction seen on CT scan. The patient has leukocytosis with an unclear source, possibly related to Clostridium difficile infection given multiple hospitalizations. He has liver cirrhosis with encephalopathy, on the transplant list, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome or a large volume tap on a prior admission. Additionally, he has altered mental status possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy or infection, and lactic acidosis most likely related to liver failure or metformin toxicity. The patient is holding oral antihyperglycemics for diabetes management and has a coagulopathy associated with liver failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with end-stage liver disease and stenosed TIPS, who has been admitted multiple times for hepatic encephalopathy. He is currently experiencing abdominal pain and has a white blood cell count of 21.3 with neutrophil predominance. The patient has massive ascites, which is likely related to hepatorenal syndrome. No signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) are present, but there is a concern for gastric outlet obstruction seen on CT scan. 

The patient also has leukocytosis with an unclear source, and there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection given his multiple hospitalizations. The patient's liver cirrhosis is exacerbated by alcohol use and encephalopathy. Hepatorenal syndrome has worsened his prognosis, potentially precipitated by a large volume tap on a previous admission. He is on the transplant list, and his Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is 41.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome, possibly due to a large volume tap or change in hemodynamics. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio (FeNa) on admission is 0.6.

Additionally, the patient has hypotension, possibly due to decreased venous return from abdominal pressure, infection, sepsis, or hypovolemia due to fluid seque"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old Portuguese-speaking man with end-stage liver
   disease and stenosed TIPS, recurrent admissions for hepatic
   encephalopathy, now here with abdominal pain and a WBC of 21.3 with a
   neutrophil predominance, lactic acidosis and hepatorenal disease.
   .
 ASCITES Likely related to massive ascites [**1-23**] likely hepatorenal
   syndrome. No evidence of SBP given low WBC on diagnostic tap; tap
   appears bloody; most likely [**1-23**] coagulopathy, though consistent
   appearance of this finding might suggest hemoperitoneum from another
   process rather than from trauma from tap; CT apparently offers no
   obvious suspect. No sign of perf on CT scan. Surgery evaluating per ED
   request. Possible gastric outlet obstruction seen on CT scan; may
   improve w decrease in ascitic fluid. U/S done, shows partial stenosis
   of the portal vein. No tap at this time due to risk of worsening
   hepatorenal syndrome, however, if worsening hypotension/renal failure,
   may need to tap due to compartment syndrome. Bladder pressure of 24
   yesterday.
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - f/u liver recs
 paracentesis of 5L
   - f/u nephrology recs  - HD tomorrow
   - albumin today 100g
   - NGT if not tolerating clears, emesis, etc
   - clear liquid diet for now
   .
 LIVER CIRRHOSIS, ETOH, w/ encephalopathy Hepatorenal syndrome worsens
   prognosis. Could have been precipitated by large volume tap on prior
   admission, though pt has tolerated similar (~5L) in the past. Pt has
   been on transplant list. MELD on admission =  41. U/S shows some
   stenosis from TIPS in protal circulation.
   - transplant surgery and liver services following, appreciate recs
   - octreotide and midodrine
   - regular lactulose at home dose
   - continue home rifaximin
   - omeprazole
   - add propranolol once completed HD and blood pressures stable
   - hold diuretics
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Likely [**1-23**]
   hepatorenal syndrome, perhaps [**1-23**] large volume tap on last admission;
   vs change in hemodynamics [**1-23**] infection; vs compartment syndrome from
   ascites causing pre-renal picture. FeNa on admission 0.6.
   - Cont zosyn
 d/c when cultures negative
   - Follow up on renal recs for HD plans
   - holding metformin - contributing to lactic acidosis
   .
HYPOTENSION Possibly due to decreased venous return due to abdominal
   pressure vs infection/sepsis vs hypovolemia due to fluid sequestration
   as ascites.
   - start levophed for SBP <80 titrate to MAPs > 65.
   - If patient becomes hypotensive consider tap to decrease
   intra-abdominal pressure
   - zosyn empirically for infection, consider adding flagyl/vanco if
   appears more toxic.
   .

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM) Per family report, patient
   currently appears to have intact mental status, however, appears
   confused at times, with mumbling and groaning on.  Possibly due to
   hepatic encephalopathy (NH3 = 66 on admission) vs infection, UTI vs
   SBP, vs acidemia. Remains afebrile
   - Lactulose - titrate to 3 BM per day
   - follow culture results
   - holding metformin
   - trend lactate
   - restraints if needed
   .
 COAGULOPATHY Assoc w liver failure. Got 6U FFP for HD line placement.
   Holding coumadin for now.
   - continue to trend coags
   - give vit K for goal INR <2.
   - consider FFP for procedures
   .
 LACTIC ACIDOSIS Most likely [**1-23**] liver failure itself, though
   metformin toxicity in setting of new renal failure may also be
   responsible. Mesenteric ischemia could be culprit; no positive evidence
   for this at this point, but should follow closely.
   - trend lactate
   - hold metformin
   - quaiac stool
   - follow AG
   .
 Leukocytosis Unclear source. Concern for abdominal source but as
   above this is not clear after dx tap and CT abd/pelvis, RLL opacity;
   hard to account for this degree of WBC with this small PNA though
   relative immune suppression of liver/renal failure may diminish
   inflammatory response. High WBC out of proportion to symptoms, with abd
   pain, in pt w multiple hospitalizations, raises special concern for c.
   diff though obvious colitis not seen on CT. Resolved since admission.
   - f/u urine, blood and ascites cultures, c.diff toxin
   - continue empiric gram negative coverage with zosyn per liver's
   request
   - consider adding vanco and flagyl if clinical status is worsening
   - trend with CBC with diff
   .
Hyperkalemia Likely in the setting of renal disease at admission, has
   resolved from 6.5 to 5.6. Currently stable at 5.0.
   - Check lytes q12h
   - Check EKG if K+ increases
    .
 LACTIC ACIDOSIS Most likely [**1-23**] liver failure itself, though
   metformin toxicity in setting of new renal failure may also be
   responsible. Mesenteric ischemia could be culprit; no positive evidence
   for this at this point, but should follow closely.
   - trend lactate
   - hold metformin
   - quaiac stool
   - follow AG
   .
 DIABETES Holding oral antihyperglycemics based on low blood sugar in
   ED today. ISS alone for now. Has had more issues with high blood sugar
   than low in the past.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with end-stage liver disease, stenosed TIPS, and recurrent admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. He presents with abdominal pain, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of lactic acidosis and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is on the transplant list. He has been admitted multiple times for hepatic encephalopathy. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 104/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen, positive asterixis, and lower extremity edema. Lab results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia. Imaging studies indicate large amounts of ascites, coarsened liver architecture, and no evidence of focal lesions. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical complications including liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension, acute renal failure (likely hepatorenal syndrome), altered mental status (possibly hepatic encephalopathy), coagulopathy (associated with liver failure), lactic acidosis (likely due to liver failure or metformin toxicity), and leukocytosis (unclear source).

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old Portuguese-speaking man with end-stage liver
   disease and stenosed TIPS, recurrent admissions for hepatic
   encephalopathy, now here with abdominal pain and a WBC of 21.3 with a
   neutrophil predominance, lactic acidosis and hepatorenal disease.
 ASCITES
   Likely related to massive ascites [**1-23**] likely hepatorenal syndrome. No
   evidence of SBP given low WBC on diagnostic tap; tap appears bloody;
   most likely [**1-23**] coagulopathy, though consistent appearance of this
   finding might suggest hemoperitoneum from another process rather than
   from trauma from tap; CT apparently offers no obvious suspect. No sign
   of perf on CT scan. Surgery evaluating per ED request. Possible gastric
   outlet obstruction seen on CT scan; may improve w decrease in ascitic
   fluid. U/S done, shows partial stenosis of the portal vein. No tap at
   this time due to risk of worsening hepatorenal syndrome, however, if
   worsening hypotension/renal failure, may need to tap due to compartment
   syndrome. Bladder pressure of 24 yesterday.
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - f/u liver recs
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - NGT if not tolerating clears, emesis, etc
   - clear liquid diet for now
 LIVER CIRRHOSIS, ETOH, w/ encephalopathy
   Hepatorenal syndrome worsens prognosis. Could have been precipitated by
   large volume tap on prior admission, though pt has tolerated similar
   (~5L) in the past. Pt has been on transplant list. MELD on admission =
    41. U/S shows some stenosis from TIPS in protal circulation.
   - daily MELD labs
   - transplant surgery and liver services following, appreciate recs
   - octreotide and midodrine
   - regular lactulose at home dose
   - continue home rifaximin
   - omeprazole
   - add propranolol once completed HD and blood pressures stable
   - hold diuretics
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely [**1-23**] hepatorenal syndrome, perhaps [**1-23**] large volume tap on last
   admission; vs change in hemodynamics [**1-23**] infection; vs compartment
   syndrome from ascites causing pre-renal picture. FeNa on admission 0.6.
   - Cont zosyn
   - Follow up on renal recs for HD plans
   - holding metformin - contributing to lactic acidosis
HYPOTENSION
   Possibly due to decreased venous return due to abdominal pressure vs
   infection/sepsis vs hypovolemia due to fluid sequestration as ascites.
   - start levophed for SBP <80 titrate to MAPs > 65.
   - If patient becomes hypotensive consider tap to decrease
   intra-abdominal pressure
   - zosyn empirically for infection, consider adding flagyl/vanco if
   appears more toxic.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Per family report, patient currently appears to have intact mental
   status, however, appears confused at times, with mumbling and groaning

 COAGULOPATHY
   Assoc w liver failure. Got 6U FFP for HD line placement. Holding
   coumadin for now.
   - continue to trend coags
   - give vit K for goal INR <2.
   - consider FFP for procedures
 LACTIC ACIDOSIS
   Most likely [**1-23**] liver failure itself, though metformin toxicity in
   setting of new renal failure may also be responsible. Mesenteric
   ischemia could be culprit; no positive evidence for this at this point,
   but should follow closely.
   - trend lactate
   - hold metformin
   - quaiac stool
   - follow AG
 Leukocytosis
   Unclear source. Concern for abdominal source but as above this is not
   clear after dx tap and CT abd/pelvis, RLL opacity; hard to account for
   this degree of WBC with this small PNA though relative immune
   suppression of liver/renal failure may diminish inflammatory response.
   High WBC out of proportion to symptoms, with abd pain, in pt w multiple
   hospitalizations, raises special concern for c. diff though obvious
   colitis not seen on CT. Resolved since admission.
   - f/u urine, blood and ascites cultures, c.diff toxin
   - continue empiric gram negative coverage with zosyn per liver's
   request
   - consider adding vanco and flagyl if clinical status is worsening
   - trend with CBC with diff
Hyperkalemia
   Likely in the setting of renal disease at admission, has resolved from
   6.5 to 5.6. Currently stable at 5.0.
   - Check lytes q12h
   - Check EKG if K+ increases
 LACTIC ACIDOSIS
   Most likely [**1-23**] liver failure itself, though metformin toxicity in
   setting of new renal failure may also be responsible. Mesenteric

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with end-stage liver disease and stenosed TIPS, presenting with abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count. He has a history of recurrent admissions for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, altered mental status, coagulopathy, lactic acidosis, leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Large amount of ascites, likely related to massive ascites and possibly hepatorenal syndrome.
2. No improvement in elevated velocities of TIPS, with possible stenosis in the mid portion.
3. Coarsened architecture liver without evidence of focal lesion.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome worsens prognosis and could have been precipitated by a large volume tap on prior admission.
5. Acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome, possibly due to a large volume tap on last admission.
6. Hypotension, possibly due to decreased venous return due to abdominal pressure or infection/sepsis.
7. Altered mental status, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, infection, urinary tract infection, or acidemia.
8. Coagulopathy, associated with liver failure.
9. Lactic acidosis, most likely due to liver failure itself, though metformin toxicity may also be responsible.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 63 year old Portuguese-speaking man with end-stage liver
   disease and stenosed TIPS, recurrent admissions for hepatic
   encephalopathy, now here with abdominal pain and a WBC of 21.3 with a
   neutrophil predominance, lactic acidosis and hepatorenal disease.
 ASCITES
   Likely related to massive ascites [**1-23**] likely hepatorenal syndrome. No
   evidence of SBP given low WBC on diagnostic tap; tap appears bloody;
   most likely [**1-23**] coagulopathy, though consistent appearance of this
   finding might suggest hemoperitoneum from another process rather than
   from trauma from tap; CT apparently offers no obvious suspect. No sign
   of perf on CT scan. Surgery evaluating per ED request. Possible gastric
   outlet obstruction seen on CT scan; may improve w decrease in ascitic
   fluid. U/S done, shows partial stenosis of the portal vein. No tap at
   this time due to risk of worsening hepatorenal syndrome, however, if
   worsening hypotension/renal failure, may need to tap due to compartment
   syndrome. Bladder pressure of 24 yesterday.
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - f/u liver recs
   - f/u nephrology recs
   - NGT if not tolerating clears, emesis, etc
   - clear liquid diet for now
 LIVER CIRRHOSIS, ETOH, w/ encephalopathy
   Hepatorenal syndrome worsens prognosis. Could have been precipitated by
   large volume tap on prior admission, though pt has tolerated similar
   (~5L) in the past. Pt has been on transplant list. MELD on admission =
    41. U/S shows some stenosis from TIPS in protal circulation.
   - daily MELD labs
   - transplant surgery and liver services following, appreciate recs
   - octreotide and midodrine
   - regular lactulose at home dose
   - continue home rifaximin
   - omeprazole
   - add propranolol once completed HD and blood pressures stable
   - hold diuretics
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Likely [**1-23**] hepatorenal syndrome, perhaps [**1-23**] large volume tap on last
   admission; vs change in hemodynamics [**1-23**] infection; vs compartment
   syndrome from ascites causing pre-renal picture. FeNa on admission 0.6.
   - Cont zosyn
   - Follow up on renal recs for HD plans
   - holding metformin - contributing to lactic acidosis
HYPOTENSION
   Possibly due to decreased venous return due to abdominal pressure vs
   infection/sepsis vs hypovolemia due to fluid sequestration as ascites.
   - start levophed for SBP <80 titrate to MAPs > 65.
   - If patient becomes hypotensive consider tap to decrease
   intra-abdominal pressure
   - zosyn empirically for infection, consider adding flagyl/vanco if
   appears more toxic.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Per family report, patient currently appears to have intact mental
   status, however, appears confused at times, with mumbling and groaning
   on.  Possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy (NH3 = 66 on admission) vs
   infection, UTI vs SBP, vs acidemia. Remains afebrile
   - Lactulose 60mg PO TID - titrate to 3 BM per day
   - follow culture results
   - holding metformin
   - trend lactate
   - restraints if needed
 COAGULOPATHY
   Assoc w liver failure. Got 6U FFP for HD line placement. Holding
   coumadin for now.
   - continue to trend coags
   - give vit K for goal INR <2.
   - consider FFP for procedures
 LACTIC ACIDOSIS
   Most likely [**1-23**] liver failure itself, though metformin toxicity in
   setting of new renal failure may also be responsible. Mesenteric
   ischemia could be culprit; no positive evidence for this at this point,
   but should follow closely.
   - trend lactate
   - hold metformin
   - quaiac stool
   - follow AG
 Leukocytosis
   Unclear source. Concern for abdominal source but as above this is not
   clear after dx tap and CT abd/pelvis, RLL opacity; hard to account for
   this degree of WBC with this small PNA though relative immune
   suppression of liver/renal failure may diminish inflammatory response.
   High WBC out of proportion to symptoms, with abd pain, in pt w multiple
   hospitalizations, raises special concern for c. diff though obvious
   colitis not seen on CT. Resolved since admission.
   - f/u urine, blood and ascites cultures, c.diff toxin
   - continue empiric gram negative coverage with zosyn per liver's
   request
   - consider adding vanco and flagyl if clinical status is worsening
   - trend with CBC with diff
Hyperkalemia
   Likely in the setting of renal disease at admission, has resolved from
   6.5 to 5.6. Currently stable at 5.0.
   - Check lytes q12h
   - Check EKG if K+ increases
 LACTIC ACIDOSIS

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with end-stage liver disease and stenosed TIPS, who has been admitted multiple times for hepatic encephalopathy. He is currently experiencing abdominal pain, leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and has been on the transplant list. His MELD score on admission is 41.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ascites: The patient has a large amount of ascites, which can lead to complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's renal function is compromised due to liver disease, leading to hepatorenal syndrome. This condition worsens prognosis and may require dialysis.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and confusion.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder associated with liver failure, which increases the risk of bleeding.
5. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, indicating possible liver failure or metformin toxicity.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
7. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to decreased venous return"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is suffering from liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure of 83/38 mmHg and a heart rate of 62 bpm. The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 96%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals massive abdominal distension, absent bowel sounds, tense ascites, scattered rales with extra wheezes in the chest, trace edema, and alertness with clear responses to questions. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), bilirubin (T Bili), liver enzymes (AST, ALT), and low levels of albumin, platelets (Plt), and hemoglobin (Hct). The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), prolonged clotting time (PTT), and elevated D-dimer levels. 

The patient's ultrasound shows persistent TIPS stenosis and large ascites. 

The assessment and plan include acute renal failure, hypotension, hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, and hypoglycemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, infections due to immunocompromised state, bleeding due to coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome progression, and hepatic encephalopathy deterioration.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and hypotension. The patient has a history of altered mental status, ascites, cirrhosis of the liver (alcoholic), hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure (acute), hypoglycemia, and is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 83/38 mmHg, heart rate of 62 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 85.5 kg, which is slightly lower than their admission weight of 87.2 kg.

The patient's arterial line was started on August 5th at 12:15 PM and ultrasound examinations were performed on August 5th at 1:30 PM and 4:00 PM. The patient required transient Levophed, higher doses of Midorine and Octreotide, and received 1 unit of packed red blood cells due to a negative fluid balance.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of bilirubin (206 mg/dL), creatinine (7.5), blood urea nitrogen (105 K/uL), and low levels of albumin (3.1 g/dL), potassium (23 mEq/L), and sodium (139 mEq/L). The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 9."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and hypotension. The patient's condition requires intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and treatment.

From the note, we can gather that the patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse, which has led to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and acute renal failure. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status and hypoglycemia.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (83/38 mmHg), a heart rate within normal limits (62 bpm), respiratory rate slightly elevated (17 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 96% while on nasal cannula oxygen delivery. The patient's bladder pressure is elevated at 20 mmHg, indicating possible abdominal distension. 

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered rales with ext wheezes in the chest, massive abdominal distension, absent bowel sounds, and tense ascites. There is also trace edema present. Neurological examination shows that the patient is alert and answering questions.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated creatinine level of 7.5, decreased albumin level of 3.1 g/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), prolonged PT/INR, and elevated bilirubin levels. Other lab values such as white blood cell count, platelet count, electrolytes, and kidney function"

","The patient's chief complaints are liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and hypotension. The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and is currently experiencing multiple complications related to their condition. These include acute renal failure, altered mental status, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hypoglycemia.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has signs of pre-renal versus evolving hepatorenal syndrome. There is a plan for hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow, with careful monitoring of electrolytes and adjusting medication dosages accordingly. A 1 mg/kg albumin challenge is also planned.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been relatively stable, but there is a concern for potential fluid shifts and hypotension when tapping the bladder. Pressors will be used as needed to support blood pressure.

3. End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD): The patient has a high MELD score of 41, indicating severe liver dysfunction. Hepatic veno-occlusive rejection (HRS) is concerning, and the liver team is following up. Consultation with transplant surgery has been made, and the patient is undergoing evaluation for liver transplant listing.

4. Acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis, with a differential diagnosis of poor forward flow versus metformin-induced acidosis in the setting of liver failure. Metformin is"

   gastric outlet obstruction seen on CT scan; may improve w decrease in
   ascitic fluid. U/S done, shows partial stenosis of the portal vein. No
   tap at this time due to risk of worsening hepatorenal syndrome,
   however, if worsening hypotension/renal failure, may need to tap due to
   compartment syndrome. Bladder pressure of 24 yesterday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with end-stage liver disease and stenosed transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). He has a history of recurrent admissions for hepatic encephalopathy and is currently experiencing abdominal pain, leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, hypotension, and hepatorenal disease.

The patient underwent paracentesis, which involved removing 5 liters of fluid and administering albumin to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 100-120 systolic. His last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 02:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/51 mmHg to 173/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. His cardiovascular examination shows comfort, orientation to person and place, but disorientation to time. His abdominal examination reveals tenderness, distention, and positive bowel sounds.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of liver failure and acute renal failure. The patient underwent a paracentesis, which was well-tolerated and removed 5 liters of fluid. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is currently receiving several medications, including omeprazole, rifaximin, PPI, octreotide, midodrine, and lactulose.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure of 110/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on sinus bradycardia and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,055 mL, including 650 mL of IV fluids, 320 mL of PO intake, and 500 mL of TF intake. The output consists of 5,838 mL of total outflow, including 500 mL of blood products, 338 mL of urine output, and 5,000 mL of drain output. This results in a negative fluid balance of -4,783 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a chief complaint of liver failure and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and renal failure. He presented to the ICU with hypotension and altered mental status. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/44 to 173/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include a weight of 85.5 kg, central venous pressure of 9 mmHg, and drains output of 5 liters. Laboratory results show low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, elevated creatinine, total bilirubin, lactate, and liver enzymes, and low albumin levels. The patient's MELD score is high at 41 with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include hypotension (resolved), ESLD with MELD score of 41 and HRS, acute renal failure (pre-renal versus hepatorenal), lactic acidosis (poor forward flow versus metformin-induced), and hyperglycemia. The plan includes hemodialysis, close monitoring of electrolytes, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. The main conditions mentioned include acute renal failure (ARF), liver failure with hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis of the liver, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and ESLD with high MELD score indicating hepatic respiratory syndrome (HRS).

The patient has undergone paracentesis, which suggests ascites. The physical examination reveals massive distension of the abdomen, tense ascites, and absent bowel sounds. The patient also complains of abdominal pain and foley pain. Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented but is asking to have their Foley catheter removed.

The vital signs show sinus bradycardia, hypotension, and normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. The fluid balance indicates a negative balance of 4,783 mL since 12 AM, suggesting fluid loss. The patient's weight has decreased from 87.2 kg at admission to 85.5 kg currently.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, bilirubin, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin, and abnormal electrolytes including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. The WBC count is slightly elevated, while the hematocrit and platelet count are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include hypotension, altered mental status (not delirium), ascites, cirrhosis of the"
