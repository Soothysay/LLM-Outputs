","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, grade 1 esophageal varices, duodenal ulcer, and [Doctor First Name 241]-[Doctor Last Name 37] tear. He presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), likely secondary to gastric variceal bleed. The patient has a history of prior GI bleeds due to multiple etiologies, including a perforated duodenal ulcer and [Doctor First Name 241]-[Doctor Last Name 37] tear. Hepatology recommends an emergent [Last Name (un) 3755] tube if the patient rebleeds tonight. The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and required one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) after the procedure.

Medical Complications:
1. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient is likely experiencing a gastric variceal bleed, as evidenced by clots and blood in the fundus during endoscopy. His hemoglobin (Hct) at presentation was 29, down from a baseline of 49. The patient has a history of prior GI bleeds, including a perforated duodenal ulcer and [Doctor First Name 241]-[Doctor Last Name 37] tear. Hepatology recommends an emergent [Last Name (un) 3755] tube if the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, grade 1 esophageal varices, duodenal ulcer, and [Doctor First Name 241]-[Doctor Last Name 37] tear who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He has a history of prior GI bleeds secondary to multiple etiologies, including perforated duodenal ulcer and [Doctor First Name 241]-[Doctor Last Name 37] tear. The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and required one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) after. He is currently intubated for airway protection due to massive upper GIB and has no history of lung disease at baseline. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 37.1°C. He is receiving fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. His abdominal ultrasound showed coarsened hepatic echo texture consistent with cirrhosis, no focal lesions or biliary ductal dilatation, and patent left and middle hepatic veins. The patient's laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 76 K/uL), elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, grade 1 esophageal varices, duodenal ulcer, and Boerhaave syndrome tear. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and had a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure performed. His hemoglobin (Hct) levels have stabilized between 25-27. He also has transaminitis, portal hypertension with varices, and a history of alcoholism. The patient was intubated for airway protection due to massive upper GIB and has now been extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB indicates a potential risk of further bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values, particularly platelet count and coagulation profile, is necessary.

2. Liver failure: The patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis and recent TIPS procedure puts him at risk for liver failure. Monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and assessing for signs of hepatic encephalopathy is essential.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholism and cirrhosis, there is a risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status or neuropsychiatric symptoms is important.

4. Thromboembolic events: Due to immobilization and the presence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, grade 1 esophageal varices, duodenal ulcer, and Boerhaave tear. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and has had multiple etiologies for prior GI bleeds, including a perforated duodenal ulcer and Boerhaave tear. This episode is likely secondary to gastric variceal bleed as clots and blood in the fundus were seen on endoscopy, although no active bleeding was observed. The patient has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, with his hematocrit (Hct) remaining in the 25-27 range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient's history of multiple GI bleeds and the presence of gastric varices increase the risk of rebleeding.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's alcoholic cirrhosis and synthetic function may predispose him to hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension can lead to hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization, there is a risk of developing infections, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
5. Hepatic hydrothorax: The patient's cirrhosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, grade 1 esophageal varices, duodenal ulcer, and Boerhaave tear. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and had a TIPS procedure performed. His hemoglobin (Hct) level has been stable in the range of 25-27. He also has transaminitis, portal hypertension with varices, and a history of alcoholism. The patient was intubated for airway protection due to massive upper GIB but is now extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient has a history of prior GI bleeds and is at risk for rebleeding, especially since he is still experiencing black stools. Close monitoring of his Hct levels and prompt intervention if necessary is important.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Although the patient currently does not have evidence of encephalopathy, his history of alcoholic cirrhosis puts him at risk. Monitoring liver function and providing appropriate management to prevent hepatic encephalopathy is crucial.
3. Infection: The patient is in the ICU and has indwelling lines, which increase his risk of developing infections. Regular monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy if needed are essential.
4. Hepatotoxicity: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, suggesting possible hepatotoxicity from the T"
