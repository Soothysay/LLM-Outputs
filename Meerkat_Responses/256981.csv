","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with an admitting diagnosis of multi lumen start. The patient underwent several diagnostic procedures including urine culture, ultrasound, and trans-thoracic echo. The patient is intubated but arousable and interactive. The patient's allergies, infusions, and other ICU medications are documented.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the below noted changes. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are within normal limits. The patient has atrial fibrillation.

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient being intubated. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and troponin levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheterization.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers due to the critically ill"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She presented unresponsive in her nursing home with hypoglycemia. She was found to have a wide open tricuspid regurgitation on echocardiogram and remained intubated but arousable and interactive. She is currently on several medications including lasix, lansoprazole, fentanyl, midazolam, and others. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/52 mmHg to 143/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation support and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Her laboratory results show some abnormalities including elevated glucose, creatinine, and liver enzymes, as well as low potassium and albumin levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. AMS (altered mental status) likely due to hypoglycemia. Other possible causes include intoxication/ingestion, cerebrovascular accident or central nervous system bleed, myocardial infarction, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, or trauma/fall. D10 infusion has been started, and fingersticks will be done every hour. Toxic screen was"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to multi-lumen insertion, urine culture, ultrasound, and transthoracic echo. The patient's glucose levels were stabilized, and she diuresed well with IV lasix. An echocardiogram revealed severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient remains intubated but is arousable and interactive. Additional history was obtained from previous hospital admissions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tricuspid Regurgitation/Pulmonary Hypertension: Severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension were noted on the echocardiogram. This can lead to right-sided heart failure and fluid accumulation in the body.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated for airway protection. Heavy secretions and weaning off sedation are being planned. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), so measures such as the VAP bundle, chlorhexidine, head-of-bed elevation, and mucolytics are being implemented.

3. Proteus Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): A positive urine culture from mid-month indicated a UTI caused by Proteus bacteria. The patient is currently on ciprofloxacin and will be started on ceftriax"

","The patient is an 81-year-old woman who presents with profound hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. The cause of her severe hypertension and RV dysfunction is unclear, and possible differentials include thromboembolic disease, chronic hypertension with potential subacute component, portopulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and primary hypertension. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with an endotracheal tube. She is also receiving sedation with midazolam. 

She has a history of massive ascites and a urinary tract infection (UTI), as indicated by pyuria. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and troponin T. Other lab values such as white blood cell count, hematocrit, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and magnesium are within normal limits. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated and sedated, with coarse breath sounds bilaterally in the chest. Distended abdomen with bowel sounds is also noted, as well as 2+ pitting edema in the extremities. 

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. Immediate goals include addressing the severe hypertension and RV dysfunction, managing respiratory failure, treating UTI, and managing massive ascites."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old woman with profound hypertension and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. She presents with respiratory failure and has been converted to CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. The patient has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Proteus bacteria, for which she will be switched to ceftriaxone. She also has massive ascites, and efforts will be made to obtain old medical records from Hospital1 to determine the cause and plan appropriate treatment. The patient is critically ill and will remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Severe Pulmonary Hypertension (pHTN) and RV Dysfunction: The patient's severe pHTN and RV dysfunction have an unclear etiology. Possible causes include thromboembolic events, chronic or subacute in nature, which are being treated with anticoagulation. Other potential causes such as portopulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and primary pHTN are also being considered. Aggressive diuresis will be implemented as part of the treatment plan.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has progressed, leading to the conversion to CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted to evaluate the possibility of extubation, considering mechanical issues and mental status and hemodynamic stability.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of sputum culture revealing Proteus infection. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/43 mmHg to 147/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a CVP of 10 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,102 mL and output of 3,900 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,798 mL. The patient is receiving midazolam infusion and various other medications. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's unconscious state. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum cultures will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Pro"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of rales on the right side and bronchial breath sounds on the left side may indicate a possible pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count, fever, and tachycardia could suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory support and ABG results indicate the potential development of ARDS.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of risk factors increase the likelihood of DVT.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's critical condition and the use of corticosteroids may predispose him to stress ulcer bleeding.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an output of 3,900 mL, which may indicate fluid overload.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is 238 mg/dL, which"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus, which is being treated with ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Other issues include acute kidney injury, anemia, gout, and chronic hep B. The patient's glucose levels are well-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection and heavy secretions. Weaning off sedation, mucolytics, nebulizers, and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) are planned. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation. Measures such as VAP bundle, chlorhexidine, head-of-bed elevation, and potential extubation later today should help reduce this risk.
2. Proteus UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus. Continuous follow-up culture sensitivities are necessary to guide antibiotic therapy effectively.
3. Chronic Hepatitis B: The patient has chronic hepatitis B with ascites seen on abdominal CT. Further evaluation of hep serologies and HBV DNA is required. Considering paracentesis may be necessary"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for airway protection and remains intubated due to heavy secretions. The patient has been experiencing increased secretions, fever, and a positive sputum culture showing 2+ GNR and 2+ GPC. She also has a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101°F, blood pressure ranging from 102/43 to 147/96 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm with atrial fibrillation, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving midazolam infusion and other ICU medications.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. The patient has a history of chronic hep B, but her liver function tests are normal. She is also anemic with a macrocytic anemia and has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's fluid balance is negative by 2,798 mL, and she has been aggressively diuresed. Her respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 352 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation.
- She was admitted with severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient has been experiencing hypoglycemia and hepatic encephalopathy.
- She has been intubated due to airway protection and heavy secretions.
- There are concerns about a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus, as indicated by a positive urine culture.
- The patient has chronic hepatitis B and ascites.
- She has a history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation, anemia, gout, and familial hypertriglyceridemia.
- There are issues with access, specifically a right internal jugular central line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection. Heavy secretions and a low respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) indicate the possibility of extubation failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The presence of Proteus in the urine culture suggests a potential UTI. It is crucial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and sedated. She has been experiencing heavy secretions, but her respiratory status has improved recently. She remains febrile overnight with a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/43 to 147/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Her weight is 77.8 kg, and her height is 62 inches.

The patient has received several infusions and medications, including midazolam, ceftriaxone, and others. She has also had various tests done, including blood cultures, urine culture, stool culture, and imaging studies.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Tricuspid Regurgitation/Pulmonary HTN: Severe 4+ on echo. Chronic etiologies potentially secondary to left-sided failure, pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, or cardiovascular disease.
2. AMS: Likely due to hypoglycemia although the patient initially treated for hepatic encephalopathy. Negative HD CT, continue strict glucose control on ISS, continues to have BS > 200, tighten ISS today.
3. Resp Failure: The patient remains intubated for airway protection. Heavy secretions and last RSBI of 103, but is comfortable on PSV 5/5 and can possibly be extubated today. However, she is now febrile overnight, and weaning off sedation should be considered. Mucolytics, nebs QID, VAP bundle, chlorhexidine, HOB elevation, and potential extubation later today.
4. Proteus UTI: + UA from mid-month. No culture data available from that admission. Follow-up culture sensitivities, continue cipro and start ceftriaxone while awaiting sensitivities.
5. Chronic Hep B: Not listed on problem list as outpatient. Has ascites seen on abdominal CT. Follow-up hep serologies, HBV DNA, and consider paracentesis.
6. DM: SSI, QID FS.
7. Atrial Fib: Coumadin for target INR, will give only 1mg daily as slightly supratherapeutic currently. Increased metoprolol from 25 to 50 mg.
8. Acute on CKD: Baseline Cr 1.6-2.2 from OSH. Cr 2.9 now from 2."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 81-year-old woman who presents with profound pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) and right ventricular dysfunction. She has been experiencing chronic issues with pHTN and RV dysfunction, as indicated by her OSH records. The patient underwent aggressive diuresis but ended up receiving 4 liters instead of the planned 2 liters, resulting in negative CVP down to the teen range. Despite stable blood pressure, her creatinine level increased and her heart rate remained in the range of 90-100.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is intubated. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 410 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. Her respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 103, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.32.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated and sedated, with coarse breath sounds bilaterally. Her abdomen is distended with bowel sounds audible. She has 2+ pitting edema and responds only to tactile stimulation. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematoc"

   and severe TR / Pulm HTN
   .
   # Tricuspid Regurgitation / Pulmonary HTN: Severe 4+ on echo. Chronic
   given old records from [**Hospital1 1195**]. Etiologies potentially secondary to Left
   sided failure, PE, OSA, CVD.  Initial thought was that her worsening
   CHF may have led to worsening renal function and prolonged halflife of
   insulin leading to her hypoglycemia. Was diuresed aggressively
   yesterday, with > -2L balance. Now lung sounds without rales
   anteriorly/laterally, and CXR without significant effusion or signs of
   pulmonary edema
   - Keep fluid balance even  today given worsening creatinine.
   - Consider restarting her home doses of lasix tomorrow
   # AMS - Likely due to hypoglycemia although pt initially treated for
   hepatic encephalopathy, though CT-abdomen shows normal appearing liver
   and LFTs are normal. Had negative HD CT.
   -          Continue strict glucose control on ISS, continues to have BS
   > 200, tighten ISS today
   -          Attempt to wean sedation off today for possible extubation
   .
   # Resp Failure
 Pt was intubated for airway protection and remained
   intubated yesterday [**1-15**] heavy secretions. Secretions continued
   overnight, though somewhat less, and last RSBI of 103. Pt comfortable
   on PSV 5/5 and can possibly be extubated today. However is now febrile
   over night, now with a sputum gram stain showing 2+ GNR and 2+ GPC in
   p/c/c. Pt also with a UTI that was not appropriately covered until
   yesterday, which could also be the source of fever. Will hold off on
   treatment until sputum cx or CXR show evidence of PNA.
   -- weaning off sedation
   -- Mucolytics
   -- Nebs QID
   -- VAP bundle, chlorhexidine, HOB elevation
   -- Extubate later today

   # Fever:  possible etiologies include PNA, UTI/Pyelonephritis.
   Currently treating her UTI which seems to be more likely source. If
   continues to be febrile or has new findings on CXR or resp status, will
   consider coverage for PNA.
   # Proteus UTI
 Had positive UA and started on Cipro, speciation showed
   proteus.
   -- Cont cipro and start Ceftriaxone while awaiting sensitivies

   # Chronic Hep B ?- Not listed on problem list as outpatient. Has
   ascites seen on abdominal CT, but normal liver.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's initial presentation included hypoglycemia and altered mental status, which were initially treated as hepatic encephalopathy. However, a CT scan of the abdomen showed a normal appearing liver, and liver function tests were normal. 

The patient has been experiencing poor glucose control with blood sugar levels consistently above 200. She also has been having small amounts of brownish-red blood per rectum, but her hematocrit has remained stable. Fever was noted overnight, and blood cultures were sent. The patient's central line was also cultured. 

The patient's vital signs show an increased heart rate (108 bpm), low blood pressure (119/51 mmHg), and slightly elevated body temperature (38.5 C or 101.3 F). Her respiratory rate is within normal limits (18 breaths per minute). Oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,272 mL since 12 AM. She has received a total of 1,471 mL of fluids, including 783 mL of total in and 426 mL of IV fluids. She has lost a total of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin. She was admitted to the ICU for airway protection due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's current condition includes hypoglycemia, fever, and evidence of fluid overload. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tricuspid Regurgitation/Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe 4+ tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. This condition can lead to right-sided heart failure and further worsening of her CHF.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's poor glucose control has resulted in hypoglycemia. If not managed properly, hypoglycemia can cause neurologic complications and even coma.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and positive urine analysis indicate a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). If left untreated, it can progress to pyelonephritis or sepsis.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening heart failure.
5. Respiratory Issues: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, as evidenced by the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old woman with several medical issues. She presents with profound pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, which is a chronic condition. The patient also has respiratory failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), massive ascites, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate (HR) between 115 and 123 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/50 to 152/69 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) between 15 and 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated, indicating respiratory support. 

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, distended abdomen with bowel sounds, and 2+ pitting edema. Neurologically, the patient responds only to tactile stimulation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and creatinine (Cr) levels. TropT (troponin T) is within normal range. Other lab values such as electrolytes, glucose, and liver function tests are also provided.

The assessment and plan indicate ongoing management of severe pHTN and RV dysfunction, respiratory failure, UTI, massive ascites, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with severe hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. She has been experiencing respiratory distress and requires mechanical ventilation. She also has a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus, massive ascites, acute kidney injury, and is receiving aggressive diuresis treatment. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory distress and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if her condition worsens or if there are any complications related to the ventilator.

2. Sepsis: The presence of fever and positive blood cultures indicate a possible infection. If the infection spreads and leads to sepsis, it can be life-threatening and require immediate intervention.

3. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury. This condition can worsen if not properly managed and can lead to further complications such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

4. Ascites: The patient has massive ascites, which increases the risk of complications like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or bowel perforation. Close monitoring and timely intervention are necessary to prevent these complications.

5. Right ventricular dysfunction: The patient's pre-existing right ventricular dysfunction makes her more susceptible to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. It is crucial to closely monitor her cardiac function and provide appropriate supportive care.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and hypertension. The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving sedation with midazolam, and has been given fluic bolus.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The kidney function tests show a slight increase in creatinine levels. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (ceftriaxone), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and nutritional support through Nutren Renal. The patient also has a multi-lumen line for multiple purposes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and glycemic control issues due to the patient being critically ill and receiving nutrition and sedation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels. Regular assessment of the patient's mental status and adherence to the prescribed medications and treatments are necessary to prevent potential complications."

   81F with PMh of DM2, CHF, CKD, AF on coumadin, hypoglycemic to FS <20
   and severe TR / Pulm HTN
   .
   # Tricuspid Regurgitation / Pulmonary HTN: Severe 4+ on echo. Chronic
   given old records from [**Hospital1 1195**]. Etiologies potentially secondary to Left
   sided failure, PE, OSA, CVD.  Initial thought was that her worsening
   CHF may have led to worsening renal function and prolonged halflife of
   insulin leading to her hypoglycemia. Was diuresed aggressively 2 days
   ago, with > -2L balance, auto-diuresed yesterday approx -1L. Now lung
   sounds without rales anteriorly/laterally, and CXR without significant
   effusion or signs of pulmonary edema.
   - Keep fluid balance even  today as pt seems to be euvolemic
   - Trend urine output today, fluid balance, lung exam, CXR and if
   evidence of fluid overload, begin adding back her home doses of lasix.
   # AMS - Likely due to hypoglycemia. Possibly [**1-15**] to worsening CHF as
   above, or infection as pt had +UA and ?PNA on CXR. CT-abdomen shows
   normal appearing liver and LFTs are normal. Had negative HD CT as
   well.  UTI treated as below.  Pt seen by family today and per family
   she is awake, alert, and has normal mentation.
   -          Continue strict glucose control on ISS
   -          Sedation has been weaned off, but 1mg Versed restarted for
   some agitation.
   .
   # Resp
 Pt was intubated for airway protection and remained intubated
   yesterday [**1-15**] heavy secretions and RSBI of 103. Secretions continued
   overnight, pt placed back on CMV. Today, was weaned slowly on vent to
   PSV of [**11-20**] and doing well. Sputum gram stain had 2+ GNR and 2+ GPC in
   p/c/c, but cx grew out only respiratory flora. Pt had fever last night,
   but has defnite source with a UTI that was not appropriately covered
   until yesterday.
   -- weaning off sedation
   -- Mucolytics
   -- Nebs QID
   -- VAP bundle, chlorhexidine, HOB elevation
   -- Extubate later today if continues to improve, or tomorrow
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). She was admitted to the ICU due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's initial presentation included hypoglycemia, fever, and respiratory distress.

The patient underwent aggressive diuresis, which resulted in a negative fluid balance. Her lung sounds improved, and a chest X-ray showed no significant effusion or signs of pulmonary edema. She continues to be euvolemic, and fluid balance is being closely monitored.

AMS (acute mental status changes) were likely due to hypoglycemia. The patient also had a urinary tract infection (UTI), which was treated with ciprofloxacin and then switched to ceftriaxone while awaiting sensitivities. The UTI appears to be the most likely source of fever.

The patient's respiratory status improved, allowing for weaning off sedation and ventilation support. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is doing well. Mucolytics and nebulizers are being used to manage secretions. VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) bundle, including chlorhexidine and head of bed elevation, is being implemented.

The patient's blood glucose levels remain high despite insulin therapy. The dose of glargine"

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with PMh of DM2, CHF, CKD, AF on coumadin, hypoglycemic to FS <20
   and severe TR / Pulm HTN
   .
   # Tricuspid Regurgitation / Pulmonary HTN: Severe 4+ on echo. Chronic
   given old records from [**Hospital1 1195**]. Etiologies potentially secondary to Left
   sided failure, PE, OSA, CVD.  Initial thought was that her worsening
   CHF may have led to worsening renal function and prolonged halflife of
   insulin leading to her hypoglycemia. Was diuresed aggressively 3 days
   ago, with > -2L balance, auto-diuresed yesterday approx -1L. Now lung
   sounds without rales anteriorly/laterally, and CXR without significant
   effusion or signs of pulmonary edema.
   - Keep fluid balance neg 500 today as pt seems to be euvolemic but
   would benefit from decreased pulmonary edema periextubation
   - Lasix 80 IV x 1 peri-extubation
   - Trend urine output today, fluid balance, lung exam, CXR and if
   evidence of fluid overload, begin adding back her home doses of lasix.
   - Will need further eval of pulm HTN as outpatient, ? further medical
   management, currently on no meds
   # AMS - Likely due to hypoglycemia. Possibly [**1-15**] to worsening CHF as
   above, or infection as pt had +UA and ?PNA on CXR. CT-abdomen shows
   normal appearing liver and LFTs are normal. Had negative HD CT as
   well.  UTI treated as below.  Pt seen by family today and per family
   she is awake, alert, and has normal mentation.
   -          Continue strict glucose control on ISS
   -          Sedation has been weaned off, but 1mg Versed restarted for
   some agitation.
   .
   # Resp
 Pt was intubated for airway protection and remained intubated
   yesterday [**1-15**] heavy secretions and RSBI of 103. RSBI today 93.
   Secretions continued overnight but were improved per nursing. Today,
   was weaned slowly on vent to PSV of [**4-17**] and doing well. Sputum gram
   stain had 2+ GNR and 2+ GPC in p/c/c, but cx grew out only respiratory
   flora. Pt Afebrile with no evidence of pulm infxn.
   -- weaning off sedation
   -- Mucolytics
   -- Nebs QID
   -- VAP bundle, chlorhexidine, HOB elevation
   -- Check ABG and extubate later today if continues to improve and if
   ABG looks good
   .
   # Fever/UTI:  Pt has Klebsiella UTI [**Last Name (un) 206**] to CTX and resistant to Cipro
   (which she was initially started on) . Currently treating her UTI which
   seems to be more likely source. If continues to be febrile or has new
   findings on CXR or resp status, will consider coverage for PNA.
   - Ceftriaxone Day [**3-23**]. Could consider change to Bactrim if needs PO
   meds as outpt
   # Chronic Hep B - Not listed on problem list as outpatient. Has ascites
   seen on abdominal CT, but normal liver.
   -- f/u hep serologies, HBV DNA neg
   -- consider paracentesis
   .
   # DM
   -- SSI , Glargine increased to 18 units QHS with tighter sliding scale
   -- FSBS 240s-260s but holding TF trhis am since planned extubation.
   -- QID FS, continue current SS and glargine for now
   .
   # Atrial Fib: target [**1-16**] INR, Coumadin restarted yesterday as outpt
   regimen when INR 2.3, 1.8 today.
   n        Increased Metoprolol from 50 TID to 50 QID for better rate
   control
   n        - Follow INR, Coumadin restarted.
   .
   # Acute on CKD
  Baseline Cr 1.6-2.2 from OSH. Cr 3.0 at peak, now
   decreased to 2.3. FENA on admission suggested pre-renal, however,
   FeUrea  now suggests renal etiology. This may represent renal injury
   [**1-15**] to the initial pre-renal failure.
   -- trending Cr, improving steadily
   -- renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia - baslilne appears to be ~30. Macrocytic.
   -- check B12, folate, Fe studies. B12, folate normal, iron borderline
   low
   -- guaiac stools, which were trace positive
   .
   # Gout/RUE pain
   n        continue colchicines
   n         will readdress with family whether this is chronic issue,

s note above and I
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would add/emphasize the
   following: The patient this morning seemed to be doing well on PSV of
   [**4-17**] with RR in 20s and good ABG
s (pH 7.45).  Thus she was extubated
   and so far seems to be doing well.  She has severe right heart failure
   due to her pulm htn so we should discuss her care with her [**Hospital1 **]
   caregivers to see if  her pulm htn has been worked upt and if she was
   previously tried on vasodilator Rx such as sidenafil.  She also seems
   to have gout and is having right wrist, elbow, and shoulder movement
   pain, which we would like to talk to her about with the help of her

","Summary:
The patient is a 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for airway protection and remained intubated yesterday due to heavy secretions and respiratory system instability index (RSBI) of 103. Her secretions improved overnight, and today she was weaned slowly off the ventilator to pressure support ventilation (PSV) of 5/5 and is doing well. She is currently afebrile, with no evidence of pulmonary infection.

The patient has been diagnosed with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), which are likely secondary to left-sided failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or cardiovascular disease (CVD). She has been aggressively diuresed, resulting in a negative fluid balance. Her lung sounds have improved, and her chest X-ray (CXR) shows no significant effusion or signs of pulmonary edema.

The patient also has a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) that is resistant to ciprofloxacin and is being treated with ceftriaxone. She has a history of chronic hepatitis B, but her liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, and she has ascites seen on abdominal CT. Her baseline creatinine level"

   81F with PMh of DM2, CHF, CKD, AF on coumadin, hypoglycemic to FS <20
   and severe TR / Pulm HTN
   .
   # Tricuspid Regurgitation / Pulmonary HTN: Severe 4+ on echo. Chronic
   given old records from [**Hospital1 1195**]. Etiologies potentially secondary to Left
   sided failure, PE, OSA, CVD.  Initial thought was that her worsening
   CHF may have led to worsening renal function and prolonged halflife of
   insulin leading to her hypoglycemia. Was diuresed aggressively 3 days
   ago, with > -2L balance, auto-diuresed yesterday approx -1L. Now lung
   sounds without rales anteriorly/laterally, and CXR without significant
   effusion or signs of pulmonary edema.
   - Keep fluid balance neg 500 today as pt seems to be euvolemic but
   would benefit from decreased pulmonary edema periextubation
   - Lasix 80 IV x 1 peri-extubation
   - Trend urine output today, fluid balance, lung exam, CXR and if
   evidence of fluid overload, begin adding back her home doses of lasix.
   - Will need further eval of pulm HTN as outpatient, ? further medical
   management, currently on no meds
   # AMS - Likely due to hypoglycemia. Possibly [**1-15**] to worsening CHF as
   above, or infection as pt had +UA and ?PNA on CXR. CT-abdomen shows
   normal appearing liver and LFTs are normal. Had negative HD CT as
   well.  UTI treated as below.  Pt seen by family today and per family
   she is awake, alert, and has normal mentation.
   -          Continue strict glucose control on ISS
   -          Sedation has been weaned off, but 1mg Versed restarted for
   some agitation.
   .
   # Resp
 Pt was intubated for airway protection and remained intubated
   yesterday [**1-15**] heavy secretions and RSBI of 103. RSBI today 93.
   Secretions continued overnight but were improved per nursing. Today,
   was weaned slowly on vent to PSV of [**4-17**] and doing well. Sputum gram
   stain had 2+ GNR and 2+ GPC in p/c/c, but cx grew out only respiratory
   flora. Pt Afebrile with no evidence of pulm infxn.
   -- weaning off sedation
   -- Mucolytics
   -- Nebs QID
   -- VAP bundle, chlorhexidine, HOB elevation
   -- Check ABG and extubate later today if continues to improve and if
   ABG looks good
   .
   # Fever/UTI:  Pt has Klebsiella UTI [**Last Name (un) 206**] to CTX and resistant to Cipro
   (which she was initially started on) . Currently treating her UTI which
   seems to be more likely source. If continues to be febrile or has new
   findings on CXR or resp status, will consider coverage for PNA.
   - Ceftriaxone Day [**3-23**]. Could consider change to Bactrim if needs PO
   meds as outpt
   # Chronic Hep B - Not listed on problem list as outpatient. Has ascites
   seen on abdominal CT, but normal liver.

   -- FSBS 240s-260s but holding TF trhis am since planned extubation.
   -- QID FS, continue current SS and glargine for now
   .
   # Atrial Fib: target [**1-16**] INR, Coumadin restarted yesterday as outpt
   regimen when INR 2.3, 1.8 today.
   n        Increased Metoprolol from 50 TID to 50 QID for better rate
   control
   n        - Follow INR, Coumadin restarted.
   .
   # Acute on CKD
  Baseline Cr 1.6-2.2 from OSH. Cr 3.0 at peak, now
   decreased to 2.3. FENA on admission suggested pre-renal, however,
   FeUrea  now suggests renal etiology. This may represent renal injury
   [**1-15**] to the initial pre-renal failure.
   -- trending Cr, improving steadily
   -- renally dose meds

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for airway protection due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She has been intubated since [**1-15**] and had heavy secretions and a respiratory system infection (RSI) with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 103. The RSBI has improved to 93 today. She was weaned slowly off the ventilator and placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) of [**4-17**], which she tolerated well. She is currently afebrile and shows no signs of pulmonary infection.

The patient's recent changes in medication include an increase in glargine to 18 units QHS, tight control of her fasting blood sugar (FSBS) at 240s-260s, and restarting sedation with midazolam (Versed). She is also on lansoprazole (Prevacid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis and ceftriaxone for a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), which is resistant to ciprofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 136/81 mmHg, respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for airway protection and remained intubated due to heavy secretions and respiratory system instability index (RSBI) of 103. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 132/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 28 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance is negative 511 mL, with a total input of 579 mL and a total output of 2090 mL. She is receiving multiple medications including metoprolol, Lasix, Coumadin, Furosemide, Lansoprazole, and Ceftriaxone.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Tricuspid Regurgitation / Pulmonary HTN: The patient has severe 4+ tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, potentially secondary to left-sided failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Initial thought was worsening CHF leading to worsening renal function and prolonged half-life of insulin causing hypogly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and gout. The patient was extubated around 1pm and experienced right arm pain/discomfort, possibly due to gout. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/61 mmHg to 165/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently on metoprolol, lansoprazole, Coumadin (warfarin), and furosemide.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gout: The patient's right arm pain/discomfort suggests a possible gout attack. Gout is a form of arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, redness, and tenderness in joints, often at the base of the big toe. It can also affect other joints, including the wrists and hands. If left untreated, gout can lead to chronic joint damage and kidney problems.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in AFib. If not managed"

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1248**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would add that the patient
   has done well  post extubation.  We will attempt to keep her right
   sided CHF compensated, by keeping her I=O and starting her outpt
   digoxin again.  We will need to get her family to help us communicate
   to her so that we might address any symptoms or concerns she may have.
   Otherwise she is stable enough to be called out to the floor.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU with severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been extubated and is now on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/61 to 160/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is alert and awake, but unable to communicate in English. 

The patient's physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds on the left side with transmitted upper airway sounds, a regular irregular 3/6 systolic murmur best heard over the right sternal border, and mild distension of the abdomen. The patient also has 1+ edema at the feet, positive Dupuytren's contractures, and an inflamed right fourth digit consistent with gout. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a history of hypoglycemia and is currently on multiple medications including Lasix, metoprolol, Lopressor, Coumadin, Prevacid, and glargine insulin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's mental status is near her baseline, and her right arm pain is chronic in nature. She has been started on digoxin, and her insulin dose has been adjusted. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/82 to 159/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is extubated and showing improvement in secretions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tricuspid Regurgitation/Pulmonary HTN: The patient has significant tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, which may lead to further cardiac complications and fluid overload.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level (Na 149), indicating hypernatremia. This can be due to minimal PO intake and ongoing losses. It is important to monitor and manage fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
3. Fever/UTI: The patient has a Proteus urinary tract infection, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's mental status has improved, but she is still not fully assessed. She is responding to commands and her right arm pain was reported as chronic by her son. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total input of 1,679 mL and output of 1,245 mL, resulting in a balance of 434 mL. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/82 mmHg to 108/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently extubated but continues to have secretions. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.7, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, and HCO3 of 22 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, platelet count of 169 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 118 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL, glucose of 153 mg/dL, and sodium of 151 mEq/L. Other lab results include elevated troponin-T, ALT, AST, lactate, and LDH levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with potassium at 4.0 mEq/L and magnesium at 2.7 mg/dL.

Plan:
The patient will receive 40 IV Lasix today to manage fluid balance. Digoxin has been restarted at a low dose and will be monitored in 2 days. Outpatient management of pulmonary hypertension is planned. The patient's sedation has been weaned off, but Versed has been restarted for agitation. Nebulizers will be continued every 4 hours. The patient has a Proteus urinary tract infection, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin. She will be on ceftriaxone. Hypernatremia is being addressed with D5W. The patient's diabetes management will be adjusted, and her atrial fibrillation medication will be continued. The patient's renal function is improving, and medications will be dosed accordingly. Anemia management will involve checking guaiac stools and aiming for a hematocrit level above 21. Gout and right upper extremity pain will be further evaluated. The patient requires a speech and swallow evaluation, and proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis will be continued. The patient's code status remains full code."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1404**]
 note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  I would add the following:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 1405**] [**Known lastname 1170**] looks quite good today, with a weight that is [**6-20**] kg less
   than several days ago.  Her right heart failure appears to be in a
   compensated state, and now we will try to put her back on oral
   diuretics hoping to maintain her current weight.
   She has managed well post extubation and is eating well enough that we
   will advance her diet, and get a swallowing eval if there seems to be
   problems.  We will  add D5W to help correct her hypernatremia, and
   continue ceftriaxone for her proteus UTI.
   Her sugars have been highish, esp in the evenings, and modifications in
   her glucose control meds will be made.
   We will attempt to find out if she has had a pulm htn work up at [**Hospital1 **],
   as at the present the cause of her pulm htn is not known, and she may
   also be a candidate for pulmonary vasodilator Rx.
   She is stable enough to be called out today.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU with severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's mental status has improved, and she is now at her baseline. She is extubated and continues to receive secretions management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 149, which indicates hypernatremia. This could be due to minimal PO intake and ongoing losses. It is important to encourage oral hydration and continue with D5W infusion to correct the sodium imbalance.
2. UTI: The patient has a Proteus urinary tract infection, which is resistant to Ciprofloxacin. She is currently on Ceftriaxone but needs to be re-evaluated for effectiveness.
3. DM: The patient's fasting blood sugar levels have been elevated (240s-260s), indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Modifications in her glucose control medication will be made to achieve better glycemic control.
4. AF: The patient's target INR for atrial fibrillation is 1.6-2.2, but her current INR is 3.0. Adjustments in her Coumadin dosage will be made to reach the target INR.
5. Acute on CKD: The patient"
