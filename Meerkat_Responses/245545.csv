   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. He requires mechanical ventilation due to severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 5-10%. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and stenting for left mainstem bronchus compression.

2. End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis. He is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for volume removal due to being 30 kg above his dry weight. Monitoring of electrolytes and titration of pressors to maintain goal blood pressure are essential.

3. Hypotension: The patient has chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 5-10%. Volume overload and positive pressure ventilation may be contributing to his hypotension. Echocardiogram evaluation for left ventricular (LV) dysynchrony is recommended.

4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1: The patient has DM1 and is on lantus and SSI at home. During this admission, he has not been on lantus. Resuming half-dose lantus and titrating as needed is advised.

5. Coronary Artery Disease:"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type I diabetes mellitus, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 5-10%, exacerbation likely due to volume overload and positive pressure ventilation for rigid bronchoscopy. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, altered mental status, left mainstem bronchial obstruction, bilateral pleural effusions, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has a history of hypothyroidism and type I diabetes mellitus.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's respiratory failure due to the bilateral pleural effusions and pneumonia. There is also a risk of further deterioration in the patient's cardiac function due to the severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and volume overload. The patient's hypotension and altered mental status indicate possible shock, which can lead to organ failure if not properly managed. The presence of ESRD and diabetes mellitus increases the risk of complications such as infections, electrolyte imbalances, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these conditions are crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchus compression, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and type I diabetes mellitus. He has been admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, renal failure, hypotension, and a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's overnight events include pacing at 80 and 100, appearing to go into runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). He feels well this morning, is alert and oriented, and complains only of feeling cold. He denies fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and chest pain.

The patient has a significant weight gain of 30 kg above his dry weight, and the renal team wants to remove 3 liters of fluid per day to get him back on the Starling curve. His vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 73/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula, and a central venous pressure of 18 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals a chronically ill-appearing male who is resting comfortably in the ICU. He has distant heart sounds, no appreciable murmur, and bilateral chest tubes in place. He also has a soft abdomen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79 kg male with a current weight of 72.8 kg.
- The patient has been receiving fluid resuscitation and diuretics to manage fluid balance.
- The patient's blood pressure remains low despite the use of vasopressors.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen saturation of 92% and a heart rate of 82 bpm.
- The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent low blood pressure despite vasopressor therapy indicates potential hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, suggesting respiratory failure. This condition can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and the need for CRRT indicate renal failure. If not managed properly, this condition can progress to further kidney damage or even renal shutdown.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an ongoing infection. Infections can be particularly concerning in critically ill patients"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchus compression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and type 1 diabetes mellitus. He is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure, exacerbation of chronic ischemic systolic heart failure, and hypotension. The patient is also being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, hypothyroidism, and electrolyte imbalances due to continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
- Acute on chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5-10%.
- Unclear if the patient has left ventricular (LV) dysynchrony, which could be contributing to his systolic failure.
- Possible atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing at a rate of 80.
- Wide complex tachycardia on telemetry with rates up to 120's possibly atrial fibrillation with aberrancy vs nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).
- Enlarged and calcified left ventricle causing left mainstem bronchial obstruction, now post bronchoscopy and stenting.
- Severe dilated cardiomyopathy reportedly due to ischemia, no current records regarding prior catheterization or interventions.
- The patient is on digoxin and midodrine.

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchus compression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10% as confirmed by echocardiography. The patient also has a biventricular pacemaker.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension and altered mental status, requiring pressor support. He is on multiple pressors including epinephrine, norepinephrine, and midodrine. The patient has poor oral intake, and nutrition support has been consulted. He is also on digoxin and has been holding beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) due to the need for pressors.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with biventricular pacing at a rate of 80 beats per minute. He experienced wide complex tachycardia on telemetry, possibly atrial fibrillation with aberrancy or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Telemetry monitoring is ongoing, and there are plans to wean levophed as tolerated. Additionally, the patient's pacemaker spikes are being evaluated for possible interference with"

The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchus compression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and type I diabetes mellitus. He is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure, renal failure, and hypotension. The patient has a massively dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and low cardiac output, as well as dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. There is also evidence of a probable left ventricular thrombus, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient has been on multiple pressors, including epi, norepi, midodrine, and neosynephrine, and is currently being weaned off levophed to maintain blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's severely dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and low cardiac output, there is a high risk of cardiogenic shock.
2. Pneumonia: The patient had fevers after bronchoscopy and stenting, which resolved on the current regimen of antibiotics. However, there is still a risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been immobilized in the ICU, increasing the risk of developing DVT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and end-stage renal disease. He has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, renal failure, and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes massively dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and low cardiac output, dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, probable left ventricular thrombus, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. He is on multiple pressors and has been weaned off epi completely. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 97.4°F (36.8°C), heart rate of 99 bpm (79-127 bpm), blood pressure of 75/56 mmHg (60-89 mmHg), respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (14-24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 66%. He is also on CVVH for volume removal due to being 30 kg above his dry weight. The patient's medical history includes type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's severely dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction and low cardiac output may lead to cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by hypotension, poor perfusion, and organ dysfunction.
2. Pulmonary edema: The"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events: WBC slightly elevated yesterday to 15.4, patient
   started on Vancomycin. Yesterday the patient was on four pressors, epi,
   norepi, midodrine, and neosynephrine and was weaned off of epi
   completely. He is currently on max dose of norepi and neosynephrine. He
   was taken off CVVH briefly yesterday to manage his pressors. A total of
   3.1 L was taken off yesterday.  O/n he was he was able to maintain SBP
   at goal >70 on max dose of levophed and neosynephrine with patient

   dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   10%). A large (2.6 x 2.1) echogenicity is seen in the left ventricle,
   adjacent to the lateral wall, consistent with thrombus. There is
   probable additional mural thrombosis closer to the apex. The right
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic stenosis. Midsystolic closure of the aortic leaflets is seen.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Massively dilated left ventricle with severe global
   systolic dysfunction and low cardiac output. Dilated and hypokinetic
   right ventricle. Probable left ventricular thrombus. Moderate mitral
   and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchus compression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and type I diabetes mellitus.
- He has acute respiratory failure and chronic hypotension that has not responded to pressor support.
- The patient's condition is complicated by acute-on-chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 5-10%, exacerbation likely due to volume overload and positive pressure ventilation.
- He also has bilateral pleural effusions, hospital-acquired pneumonia, hypothyroidism, and a history of hypotension and altered mental status.
- The patient is currently on CVVH for volume removal, and his electrolytes should be monitored closely.
- He has been weaned off some medications, including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, due to the need for pressor support.
- The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention. It is essential to monitor his oxygen saturation levels and provide appropriate respiratory support.

2. Hypotension: The patient's chronic hypotension is a significant concern. It is necessary to carefully manage his blood pressure, ensuring adequate perfusion and organ function. Titration of pressor medications will be crucial in maintaining stable blood pressure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a chronically ill male with multiple medical conditions. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type I diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75/56 mmHg to 60/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 66% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds with a regular rapid rate (RRR), no appreciable murmur, bilateral chest tubes in place, bibasilar crackles in the lungs, a soft abdomen with slight distension and a reducible umbilical hernia, and evidence of venous stasis dermatitis with slight arterial ulceration in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.8 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 84 to 237 mg/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels of 2.9-3.1 mg/dL, and abnormal electrolyte levels including potassium (K+) of 24 mEq/L and sodium (Na+) of 134 mEq/L. Other lab results are also provided in the note.

The patient's past medical history includes a right below-knee amputation (BKA), left lower extremity venous stasis dermatitis, arterial ulceration, and a palpable left deep peroneal nerve (DP) pulse.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, phenylephrine, norepinephrine, potassium chloride (KCl), calcium gluconate, famotidine (Pepcid), and prophylactic heparin.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Infection: The patient has impaired skin integrity and a history of venous stasis dermatitis, which increases the risk of infection, particularly in the lower extremities.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is on the higher end of the normal range, and oxygen saturation is low at 66%. This indicates potential respiratory distress and the need for further evaluation and management.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Renal failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which puts him at risk for further renal complications. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly are important.

5. Diabetic complications: The patient has type I diabetes mellitus"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The summary of the information includes:

- The patient has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not ARDS), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type I diabetes mellitus, and hypotension (not shock).
- The patient is receiving various medications and infusions, including heparin sodium, phenylephrine, norepinephrine, KCl, and calcium gluconate through CRRT. They are also on other ICU medications like famotidine and prophylactic heparin.
- The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75/56 mmHg to 60/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 66%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 19 mmHg, with fluid balance indicating an input of 6,985 mL and output of 8,007 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,022 mL.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 15.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 34.3%, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 2.9, low potassium (K+) at 3.9 mEq/L, high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 157 mg/dL, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The elevated WBC count suggests the possibility of an infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment would be necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to the underlying conditions or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Continuous monitoring and appropriate adjustments to fluid and medication therapy are required.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation indicate respiratory failure. Continued support with mechanical ventilation or other respiratory interventions may be necessary.

4. Renal failure: The elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. In the context of ESRD, it is crucial to ensure adequate dialysis management to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

5. Diabetic complications: The patient has type I diabetes mellitus, which increases the risk of diabetic complications such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or diabetic ketoacidosis. Close monitoring of glucose levels and insulin therapy is essential.

6. Skin integrity: The impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infection. Regular repositioning and wound care should be implemented.

7. Fluid balance: The negative fluid balance suggests ongoing fluid losses or inadequate fluid administration. Careful monitoring and adjustment of fluid intake and output are necessary to maintain proper hydration.

8. Hypokalemia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchus compression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU for acute on chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient has a biventricular pacemaker and is experiencing hypotension, altered mental status, and episodes of wide complex tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and low ejection fraction, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to vital organs.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia and is currently receiving antibiotics. There is still a risk of developing new infections or experiencing complications from existing infections.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has ESRD and is on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH). There is a risk of worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient's wide complex tachycardia may indicate atrial fibrillation with aberrancy or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further arrhythmias.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchial obstruction, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type I diabetes mellitus, and a history of atrial fibrillation. He is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing periods of confusion regarding his location, but denies any chest pain or shortness of breath. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.5°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 61/29 mmHg to 88/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has pitting edema in all four extremities, an ulceration on the anterior surface of his left arm, and venous stasis dermatitis on his lower legs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, indicating reduced heart function. This puts him at risk for further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy and left mainstem bronchial obstruction. This can lead to impaired gas exchange and respiratory muscle weakness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchus compression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), and chronic pleural effusion. He has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently experiencing acute on chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10% and has undergone a biventricular pacemaker implantation. He is also suffering from hospital-acquired pneumonia, hypothyroidism, and bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is on positive pressure ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and low ejection fraction make him at high risk for cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Failure: As the patient has ESRD, he is dependent on CVVH for renal function. Any complications or malfunctioning of the CVVH machine could lead to further deterioration in renal function.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is slightly below normal, with a current temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F) and a maximum temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F) over the past 24 hours. The patient's heart rate is within normal range at 89 bpm, with a range of 79-107 bpm. The blood pressure readings are concerning, with both systolic and diastolic pressures being very low, ranging from 53-61 mmHg for systolic and 37-46 mmHg for diastolic. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation remains high at 98% with the use of a nasal cannula.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (14.6 K/uL) and platelet count (69 K/uL), with slightly decreased hemoglobin levels (11.4 g/dL) and hematocrit (34.2%). The creatinine levels are gradually increasing, indicating possible worsening renal function (1.2-1.8 mg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchus compression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of type I diabetes mellitus. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of chronic ischemic systolic heart failure, volume overload, and positive pressure ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, ventricular tachycardia, and chronic pleural effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a hospital-acquired pneumonia, which may progress if not adequately treated.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has ulcers on his left arm and arterial ulceration on his toes, indicating compromised skin integrity. This can lead to further infection or complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to positive pressure ventilation and underlying chronic conditions. This may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can potentially progress to sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, leading to cardiac arrest.
5. Chronic Pleural Effusion: The patient has a chronic pleural effusion, which may continue to accumulate and cause respiratory compromise if not addressed.

   [**2-15**] atrial fibrillation with aberrancy vs NSVT.
   -monitor on telemetry
   -will try to wean levophed as tolerated
   -consider pacemaker interrogation in the am as some of the pacemaker
   spikes appear to be occurring on the qrs complex
   -anticoagulation has been held thus far during his admission; consider
   bridging with heparin as he has h/o LV thrombus and additional mural
   thrombi by echo [**2179-8-17**].
   #ESRD - currently on CVVH for volume removal given hypotension.
   According to renal team he is 30kg above his dry weight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, left mainstem bronchus compression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and type I diabetes mellitus. He has been admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not ARDS), pneumonia (hospital-acquired), and hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 74/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, bibasilar crackles, a soft abdomen, and venous stasis dermatitis on the lower extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, prolonged PT/INR, and altered electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal chronic pleural effusion and enlarged left ventricle.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pleural effusion, chronic: Continue monitoring and managing as per the plan.
2. Ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained (NSVT): Monitor on telemetry and consider pacemaker interrogation.
3. Pneumonia, hospital-acquired: Continue current antibiotic regimen for an"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9204**] is a 69 yo M with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
   5-10%), L mainstem bronchus compression [**2-15**] LV enlargement s/p
   bronchoscopy and stenting, ESRD on CVVH, course c/b post bronch
   hypotension and inability to wean pressor support.
   .
   # PUMP: Acute on chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with EF 10% by
   echo [**2179-8-17**], exacerbation likely [**2-15**] combination of volume overload (up
   30kg from dry weight) and positive pressure ventillation for rigid
   bronchoscopy.  Patient with a biventricular pacer.
   -continue CVVH for volume removal as pt is 30kg over his dry weight
   -goal of 2-4kg of volume removal daily
   -continue 0.5 mcg/kg/min of neosynephrine, currently on 5 mcg/kg/min
   of  levophed to maintain BP, patient maintaining goal SBP >70, and
   mentating appropriately, begin weaning levophed today
   -continue digoxin
   -holding BB, ACEI given need for pressors at this time
   -continue midodrine
   .
   # CORONARIES: severe dilated cardiomyopathy reportedly due to ischemia,
   no current records regarding prior cath or interventions.
   -not on ASA, statin, plavix as outpatient
   -obtained OSH records re: cardiac history (in chart)
   .
   # RHYTHM: Underlying atrial fibrillation with biventricular pacing at a
   rate of 80.  [**Company 1994**] VVIR at a rate of 80.  Yesterday he had periods
   of wide complex tachycardia on telemetry with rate up to 120's possibly
   [**2-15**] atrial fibrillation with aberrancy vs NSVT.
   -monitor on telemetry
   -will try to wean levophed as tolerated
   -consider pacemaker interrogation in the am as some of the pacemaker
   spikes appear to be occurring on the qrs complex
   -anticoagulation has been held thus far during his admission; consider
   bridging with heparin as he has h/o LV thrombus and additional mural
   thrombi by echo [**2179-8-17**].
   .
   #ESRD - currently on CVVH for volume removal given hypotension.
   According to renal team he is 30kg above his dry weight.
   -continue CVVH per renal recs, goal removal of [**2-17**] kg/day of volume
   -titrate pressors for goal BP >70 or to prevent symptoms
   -monitor electrolytes
   -add nephrocaps
   .
   # Hypotension/altered mental status
 this AM, mentation appropriate,
   (MAP now 55).  Will keep neosynephrine and wean levophed, with goal SBP
   70s.
   .
   #Left mainstem bronchial obstruction - [**2-15**] enlarged and calcified left
   ventricle, now s/p stenting of left mainstem with resolution of left
   lung collapse.
   -appreciate IP reccs
   -abx for possible HAP as below
   .
   #bilateral pleural transudative effusions - [**2-15**] congestive heart
   failure, continues to drain via bilateral pigtail catheters.  Continue
   to monitor output.
   -appreciate IP reccs
   -monitor output
   .
   #DM1 - on lantus and SSI at home, has not been on lantus during this
   admission.
   -resume half dose lantus and titrate as needed
   -hiss
   .
   #Hospital acquired pneumonia - he had fevers s/p bronch and stenting
   which resolved on current regimen of abx.
   -continue vanc, zosyn for 8 day course (day 1 = [**8-14**])
   -follow vanc levels daily and dose per CVVH protocol
   .
   #Hypothyroidism - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN - electrolyte monitoring/repletion per CVVH protocol, nutrition

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and diabetes mellitus type 1. He is currently in the ICU due to acute exacerbation of chronic ischemic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and has not been able to wean off pressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has chronic pneumonia and is at risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially due to the recent bronchoscopy and stenting procedure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory function due to his underlying conditions.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers and infections.
4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease, which increases the risk of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires careful monitoring and management to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
6. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Monitoring for and managing cardiac arrhythmias is important.
7. Infection: The patient is at increased risk of developing infections,"
