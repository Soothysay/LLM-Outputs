","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and previous incomplete ablation procedure. She presented with moderate pericardial effusion and impaired ventricular filling, for which a pericardial drain was placed without complications. The patient is currently asymptomatic but reports mild pleuritic chest pain with palpation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 108/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a WBC count of 664 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and potassium level of 0.6 mg/dL. She is also on various medications including atenolol, simvastatin, ASA, and Vicodin for pain control. The patient has a history of breast cancer and papillary bladder cancer.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac tamponade: Given the patient's history of pericardial effusion and impaired ventricular filling, there is a risk of developing cardiac tamponade, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and the need for pericardi"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with chest pain and pressure, which has now improved to a mild intensity. They also report shortness of breath but no palpitations or dizziness. The patient remains asymptomatic and has been in normal sinus rhythm overnight without any episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. 

The patient has a pericardial drain in place. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm (normal range), blood pressure of 108/70 mmHg (within normal range), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (normal range), and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. 

Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable readings. Fluid balance indicates a total intake of 440 mL (with 440 mL by PO), total output of 1050 mL (including 400 mL of urine), resulting in a negative balance of 610 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///29/. 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. Eyes, head, ears, nose, and throat are normal. Lymphatic system shows no lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal PMI, S1, and S2 sounds, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Peripheral vascular examination is also"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old lady with a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) who presented with moderate pericardial effusion and impaired ventricular filling. She underwent placement of a pericardial drain without complications. The patient is currently asymptomatic, with mild pleuritic chest pain upon palpation. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pericardial Effusion/PUMP: Outpatient TTE on 10-19 showed moderate pericardial effusion with impaired ventricular filling. The patient will have a repeat TTE to check for re-accumulation of fluid. If no re-accumulation is found, the drain will be removed.
2. RHYTHM: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with a history of SVT and left lateral bypass tract with pre-excitation. She will continue to be monitored on tele and take atenolol 25mg po daily.
3. CORONARIES: The patient's chest pain is most likely due to hemopericardium. She has no known coronary artery disease (CAD) but has a history of hyperlipidemia. She will continue taking simvastatin and ASA 81mg.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated at 13.5, which may be secondary to the pericardial effusion. Prophylactic Keflex will be given after"

   home. Pt ambulating comfortably, had 6 beats of Vtach last night around
   19:30.
   Patient feels well, ready to go home. Denies CP but has mild irritation
   since drain was removed last night, well controlled on current pain

","The patient is a 66-year-old lady with a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) who presented with moderate pericardial effusion and impaired ventricular filling. A pericardial drain was placed without complications. The patient is currently asymptomatic, with mild pleuritic chest pain upon palpation. The plan includes monitoring for any increase in right atrial pressure or drop in blood pressure, which may require further pericardiocentesis. The drain was removed without difficulty, and a repeat transthoracic echo (TTE) is planned for this morning. Blood cultures have been obtained, and pericardial fluid studies and cultures will be followed up. Antibiotics will be started if the patient develops fever or if cultures are positive. Colchicine and Vicodin will be continued for pain control.

The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm, but she has a history of SVT with evidence of a left lateral bypass tract and pre-excitation. An incomplete ablation procedure was performed during her last admission. A few beats of wide complex tachycardia occurred last night, so monitoring will be continued. Atenolol 25mg will be given daily.

There are no known coronary artery diseases, but the patient's chest pain is likely due to hemopericardium. She has a history of hyperlipidemia, and simvastatin and aspirin 81mg will be continued.

Leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.5 is present, but the patient is afebrile and does not have cough, diarrhea, or dysuria. This may be secondary to pericardial effusion. Prophylactic Keflex has been finished, and blood cultures are pending.

Normocytic anemia with a hematocrit level of 30.4 is present. The patient has been feeling weak overall for the past 10 days. Guaiac stools and iron studies are pending to investigate anemia of chronic disease.

Anxiety will be managed with Xanax per the outpatient regimen, and Ambien will be given for sleep.

The patient has a history of breast cancer and papillary bladder cancer, and she needs outpatient follow-up for these conditions.

The patient's diet will be cardiac heart-healthy, and electrolytes will be given as needed.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is likely to be discharged to the floor today."
