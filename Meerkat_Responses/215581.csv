   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter who presents with fevers,
   tachycardia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Pyelonephritis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with temperature of 102
   and HR > 90, although no leukocytosis/leukopenia.  Likely source is
   urinary given U/A.  Other possibility includes VP shunt.  Chest x-ray
   negative. History of MRSA and Vanc sensitive enterococcus in prior
   urine cultures.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65, urine output > 30cc/hr
   - Blood cx pending
   - Urine cx positive for mixed flora, likely fecal contaminant. Will
   re-check another urine cx.
   - Will continue patient on Vancomycin (Day#2) and Bactrim (Day#2) (past
   culture showed bactrim-sensitive, pt had allergy to PCN).
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Will change suprapubic catheter
   .
   # Tachycardia - Sepsis most likely etiology.  Improved today with HR in
   upper 90s.
   .
   # Mental status changes
 resolved. Pt appears to be back to baseline.
   .
   #.  Pain control - Continue lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and morphine
   15mg PRN.  Acetaminophen PRN. Will try adding Fentanyl patch for
   additional relief.
   .
   #?[**Name (NI) 1042**] pt with decreased sats to 80s and periods of apnea while
   sleeping. Will continue O2 sat monitoring, try CPAP tonight if still in
   unit.
   - Outpatient sleep study.
   .
   # GERD - Continue omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Tobacco use - Continue nicotine patch
   .
   # FEN:  Regular diet
   .
   # Access: PICC later today.
   .
   # PPx:  Heparin SC, omeprazole, bowel regimen.
   .
   # Code:  Full code
   .
   # Dispo:  As pt improved significantly in mental status and hemodynamic
   status, will likely call out to floor today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She presents with fevers, tachycardia, and back pain. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 105/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is alert and awake, with no tenderness at the suprapubic catheter site. The patient has pitting edema in her lower legs and a positive blood culture for mixed flora. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Pyelonephritis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis-related illness with a high temperature and elevated heart rate. The likely source of infection is the urinary tract, possibly due to the suprapubic catheter. Other possibilities include a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. A chest X-ray was negative. The patient will receive IV fluid boluses, blood cultures, and continue on Vancomycin and Bactrim. The suprapubic catheter will be changed, and the white blood cell count fever curve will be monitored.

2. Tachycardia: The most likely cause is sepsis. The patient's heart rate improved today.

3. Mental status changes:"

   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with temperature of 102 and HR >
   90, although no leukocytosis/leukopenia.  Likely source is urinary
   given U/A.  Other possibility includes VP shunt.  Chest x-ray negative,
   blood cultures pending.  History of MRSA and Vanc sensitive
   enterococcus in prior urine cultures.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65, urine output > 30cc/hr
   - If blood pressure/urine output refractory to fluid, then place
   central venous line, fluids to CVP > 8, and Levophed if still
   hypotensive/oliguric.
   - Empiric Vancomycin and ceftriaxone, even though she recently
   completed 5-day course of this, may have been insufficient duration and
   therefore, would not represent treatment failure.
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Change suprapubic catheter
   - CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast to assess for pyelonephritis
   .
   # Tachycardia - Sepsis most likely eatiology.  Other concern is PE, but
   will re-assess if not responding to fluids, whether this needs to be
   further worked up.
   .
   # Mental status changes - Initial presentation consistent with
   hyperactive delerium likely secondary to infection.  Now appears to be
   more somnolent secondary to sedating medications.  Unlikely to be
   related to VP shunt since otherwise asymptomatic from that standpoint,
   but can consider working this up if no improvement from treating above
   causes and waiting for sedating medications to wear off.
   .
   #.  Pain control - Continue lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and morphine
   15mg PRN.  Acetaminophen PRN.

","Summary:
The patient presented with hypotension, fever, and altered mental status. They have a history of allergies to penicillins and Ventolin HFA (Albuterol Sulfate), and are currently on various medications including heparin, nicotine patch, iron, neurontin, lidocaine patch, Bactrim, omeprazole, and morphine. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/79 to 132/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is unable to stand due to an unknown reason.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Fever
2) Hypotension
3) Altered mental status

The patient is now afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The mental status appears to be at baseline. However, the patient complains of diffuse pain and is asking for morphine, which may indicate possible drug-seeking behavior. It is suggested to consider a fentanyl patch for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a leaking suprapubic catheter, and there is evidence of mixed flora in the urine. This increases the risk of a urinary tract infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, indicating episodes"

   Assesment: This is a 30 year-old female with a history of spina bifida,
   recurrent UTIs, suprapubic catheter who presents with fevers,
   tachycardia.
   .
   Plan:
   # Pyelonephritis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with temperature of 102
   and HR > 90, although no leukocytosis/leukopenia.  Likely source is
   urinary given U/A.  Other possibility includes VP shunt.  Chest x-ray
   negative. History of MRSA and Vanc sensitive enterococcus in prior
   urine cultures.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65, urine output > 30cc/hr
   - Blood cx pending
   - Urine cx positive for mixed flora, likely fecal contaminant. Will
   re-check another urine cx.
   - Will continue patient on Vancomycin (Day#2) and Bactrim (Day#2) (past
   culture showed bactrim-sensitive, pt had allergy to PCN).
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Will change suprapubic catheter
   .
   # Tachycardia - Sepsis most likely etiology.  Improved today with HR in
   upper 90s.
   .
   # Mental status changes
 resolved. Pt appears to be back to baseline.
   .
   #.  Pain control - Continue lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and morphine
   15mg PRN.  Acetaminophen PRN. Will try adding Fentanyl patch for
   additional relief.
   .
   #?[**Name (NI) 1042**] pt with decreased sats to 80s and periods of apnea while
   sleeping. Will continue O2 sat monitoring, try CPAP tonight if still in
   unit.
   - Outpatient sleep study.

","The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent UTIs, and a suprapubic catheter. She presents with fevers, tachycardia, and no leukocytosis/leukopenia. The assessment indicates possible pyelonephritis, likely of urinary origin given the presence of fever and elevated heart rate. The patient meets SIRS criteria with a temperature of 102 and HR > 90. A chest x-ray was negative. There is also a possibility of a VP shunt infection. Urine cultures show mixed flora, likely fecal contaminant, and will be rechecked. The patient is already on Vancomycin (Day#2) and Bactrim (Day#2), which is sensitive to previous urine cultures. The patient had an allergy to penicillin. Fluid resuscitation is being initiated to maintain MAP > 65 and urine output > 30cc/hr. Blood cultures are pending. 

The patient's tachycardia is likely due to sepsis, but it has improved with the heart rate in the upper 90s. Mental status changes have resolved, and the patient appears to be back to baseline. Pain control measures are in place, including a lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and morphine 15mg PRN. Acetaminophen will be used as needed. Fentanyl patches will be added for additional relief.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She presented with fevers and tachycardia. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, and she is alert and awake. Physical examination reveals no major abnormalities. The patient has a history of MRSA and vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus in prior urine cultures.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis-related illness with a temperature of 102°F and heart rate > 90 bpm. The likely source is urinary given the urinalysis findings. Other possibilities include a VP shunt. A chest x-ray was negative. The patient will receive IV fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg and urine output > 30cc/hr. Blood cultures are pending, and a repeat urine culture will be done. The patient will continue on Vancomycin (Day#2) and Bactrim (Day#2) due to a prior culture showing bactrim sensitivity and the patient's allergy to penicillin.

2. Tachycardia: Sepsis is the most likely etiology. The heart rate improved today, reaching the upper 90s.

3. Mental status changes: Resolved. The patient appears to be back to baseline.

The patient is a 30-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a suprapubic catheter. She presents with fevers, tachycardia, and no leukocytosis/leukopenia. The patient meets SIRS criteria, indicating a possible infection.

Blood cultures are pending, and urine cultures show mixed flora likely due to fecal contamination, as well as yeast.

The patient has been on vancomycin (Day #3) and Bactrim (Day #3), which were chosen because of the patient's allergy to penicillin. The WBC count fever curve will be trended. The suprapubic catheter was changed yesterday by Urology.

Other issues include tachycardia, which is likely due to sepsis, mental status changes that have resolved, and pain control.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight individual with a chief complaint of fever, hypotension, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's suprapubic catheter was changed yesterday, and there has been an improvement in leakage. Fentanyl patch has been started, resulting in somewhat improved pain. However, a bedside percutaneous central catheter (PICC) could not be obtained. The patient required lorazepam last night for restlessness. 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, unknown allergens, and Ventolin HFA. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Bactrim on 08/16/2157 at 8:34 PM and Vancomycin on 08/17/2157 at 8:43 AM. The patient is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lorazepam, nicotine patch, ferrous sulfate, omeprazole, fentanyl patch, Tylenol, ibuprofen, and morphine.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted improvements. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 88 bpm (normal range: 86-112 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 104/68 mmHg to 99/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 5 breaths per minute (normal range: 0-24"
