   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of dermatomyositis, hypertension, aortic stenosis, and chronic hypercapnea. She presents with respiratory failure and bilateral lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and sedated. 

The assessment and plan section indicates that the patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure due to multifocal consolidation on CT scan, dermatomyositis with generalized weakness, diastolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, aortic stenosis, anemia, hyperglycemia likely caused by steroids, osteopenia, and chronic pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), bleeding due to prolonged PT/PTT, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications related to her underlying medical conditions, such as worsening heart failure or exacerbation of dermatomyositis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of dermatomyositis, hypertension, aortic stenosis, and chronic pain. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by bilateral lower lobe pneumonia (LL PNA). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. She is also sedated with fentanyl and midazolam infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/62 to 158/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the respiratory symptoms related to her pneumonia. Her physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, rales in the lungs, soft abdomen, no extremity edema, and areas of skin removal for a potential skin graft on her right thigh. Neurologically, she is awake, alert, and able to write answers to questions appropriately.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 155 mg/dL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, low platelet count of 219 K/uL, and normal kidney function with a creatinine level of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of dermatomyositis (on steroids), hypertension, aortic stenosis (unknown valve area), and chronic pain. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which may be due to multifocal consolidation on CT scan or chronic hypercapnea from respiratory muscle weakness associated with dermatomyositis or steroid myopathy.

The patient's recent events include hypoglycemia, tachypnea after talking to her daughter, and a left hip dislocation, although she refused ortho consult. Rheum consult has been placed for weakness and dermatomyositis, and x-rays are pending from her PCP.

Vital signs show a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 136/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 40%. She is intubated and sedated but communicative over the ET tube. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds, distant heart sounds, right bundle branch block on ECG, and areas of skin removal for skin graft on the right thigh.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other labs are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of dermatomyositis, hypertension, aortic stenosis, and chronic pain. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to bilateral lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has generalized weakness and is intubated. Her vital signs are stable, but she is tachypneic. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels. She has anemia, hyperglycemia, and osteopenia. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is the primary reason for her ICU admission. She has bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, and there is a concern for chronic hypercapnea due to respiratory muscle weakness from dermatomyositis or steroid myopathy.
2. Diastolic CHF: The patient may have diastolic congestive heart failure, as indicated by her aortic stenosis. This condition can worsen if not managed properly.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating a potential risk of hypotension. This could be exacerbated by sepsis or other complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated glucose levels, likely due to steroid use for dermatomyositis. Poor glycemic control can lead to further complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation. He was extubated at 1400 on 2111-12-3. The patient has a history of rheumatic disease and neuromuscular condition, for which he is receiving prednisone treatment. An echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy, mild aortic stenosis, and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient's left ventricular systolic function is normal with an ejection fraction of 70-80%, and there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a current temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 103 bpm (normal range: 69-120 bpm), blood pressure of 151/66 mmHg (with previous readings ranging from 115/64 mmHg to 168/100 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-33 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 59.7 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 925 mL and output of 326 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,540 mL. The patient has received IV fluids totaling 504 mL and blood products totaling 3,465 mL. Urine output is also recorded at 3,465 mL. No information is provided regarding NG tube, stool, or drain outputs.

The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 138 mL (138-222 mL), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 57 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 108 mmHg, oxygen consumption (VO2) of 36 mL/min, and oxygen delivery (DO2) of 550 mL/min.

Physical examination findings are incomplete as assessments for peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, and tone are not documented.

Laboratory results include white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 5.8 to 7.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 29.0% to 35.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 80 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 83 to 155 mg/d"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 81-year-old female with a medical history of dermatomyositis, hypertension, and unknown aortic valve area. She presented with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The patient's current condition shows improvement as she has been extubated. However, she remains in the ICU for further monitoring and management of her medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which required intubation and invasive ventilation. Although she has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if her lung function does not improve or if she develops any complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Dermatomyositis: The patient has a history of dermatomyositis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the skin and muscles. It is important to continue steroid treatment as recommended by rheumatology and consult a neuro musculoskeletal specialist to evaluate for causes of weakness.

3. Diastolic CHF: The patient may have diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with impaired left ventricular relaxation. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is necessary to prevent exacerbation of CHF symptoms.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be carefully monitored and managed to control her hypertension. Adjustments in antihypertensive medication may be required based on"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of dermatomyositis (on steroids), hypertension, and aortic stenosis. She presents with hypoxia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and hyperglycemia. The patient was previously intubated but is now extubated and stable on 4 liters of oxygen. The plan is to attempt weaning from the ventilator today and consider BiPAP at night due to atelectasis and elevated hemidiaphragm. Rheumatology recommends continuing steroids for dermatomyositis. A neuro musculoskeletal consult has been requested to evaluate for causes of weakness. The patient's hypertension medications have been increased, and an echocardiogram will be checked. The patient has a DNR code status and is being considered for possible discharge to a rehab facility.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure, which has improved with extubation and oxygen therapy. However, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the patient does not tolerate weaning from the ventilator or if underlying causes are not addressed.

2. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient shows signs of diastolic congestive heart failure, which may worsen if fluid balance is not carefully managed or if the underlying cause is not treated appropriately.

3. Anemia: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of dermatomyositis, hypertension, aortic stenosis, and chronic pain. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and hypoxia. She has been extubated and is currently stable on 4 liters of oxygen. The patient has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and started on Cipro 500mg Q12h for 7 days. Her dermatomyositis is being managed with steroids, and she will continue with the current treatment plan as recommended by rheumatology and neuro musculoskeletal consult. The patient is also being treated for diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and anemia. She has hyperglycemia, likely due to steroid use, but no known diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2. Her HbA1c level is 6.4%. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status and will be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. Although she has been extubated and is stable on supplemental oxygen, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if she is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has been diagnosed with a UTI, and appropriate antibiotics have been started."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of dermatomyositis (on steroids), hypertension (HTN), aortic stenosis (AS), and chronic pain. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, which has improved since being extubated and placed on 4L of oxygen. Her dermatomyositis is being managed with steroids, and further evaluation for causes of weakness is planned. The patient also has diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), which will be monitored with gentle hydration and continued medication. Her hypertension medications have been increased. The aortic stenosis valve area is within normal limits. She has anemia, but the baseline is unknown. Hyperglycemia is likely due to steroid use. Chronic pain management will continue. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she has two peripheral IV lines. Pneumoboots and a bowel regimen are in place for prophylaxis. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status and may require a call out of the ICU. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which has improved since being extubated. However, there is still a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if she is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Dermatomyositis: The patient's dermatomyositis may cause ongoing muscle weakness and fatigue. It is important to monitor"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with a history of dermatomyositis and admission for
   respiratory failure and likely trigger of respiratory infection in the
   setting of poor reserves triggering events considered most likely.  She
   has had successful extubation following and relatively minimal period
   of ventilatory support.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Extubated, comfortable, restrictive ventilatory
   defect is at issue and will be persistent challenge
   -AM ABG if patient agrees
   -[**Hospital1 **]-level support overnight may provide good support of ventilation

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of dermatomyositis admitted for respiratory failure. She had a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) based on urine analysis and was successfully extubated without any events. The patient has allergies to penicillins and an unknown allergy. She is currently on various ICU medications, including infusions and other medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/72 mmHg to 199/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,032 mL, including 120 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 1,570 mL, including 710 mL of urine. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 59.7 kg.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings include general appearance as thin, poor dentition, symmetric chest expansion, dullness, diminished breath sounds on the right side, soft non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, and diffuse weakness noted. Neurologic examination reveals the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has not been"
