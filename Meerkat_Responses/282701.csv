   Assessment and Plan
   20 F with no PMHx s/p MVA accident and tib-fib s/p ORIF transferred
   from Ortho Service to Medicine and now MICU for worsening hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Still unclear etiology with ARDS physiology. Considered
   infection with atypical organisms vs flu, fat emboli, aspiration.
   - Bronch today to r/o infection, eosinophilia and perhaps diagnose fat
   emboli syndrome
   - CXR to confirm ET tube placement as well as for interval assessment
   - Continue vanco and zosyn for coverage of HAP as well as levofloxacin
   for atypicals
   - Follow fever and WBC curve
   - F/u sputum cx, send urine legionella and influenza DFA
   - Continue lovenox for ppx
   - Supportive ventilation with fentanyl/versed for sedation-PRN morphine
   for turns; wean as tolerated
   - F/u any Pulm recs (consulted on floor)
   - Re-attempt a-line today for repeated ABGs
   - Change tidal volumes based on height
   - consider esophageal balloon pressure today to ensure measuring lung
   compliance and not chest wall compliance given obesity
   # Hypotension: Hypotensive in setting of positive pressure on vent as
   well as sedation. Concern for sepsis in setting of infection. Better
   today after pressors and IVF.
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain MAP >60. UOP >30. CVP>12
   - Attempt to wean pressors today
   - F/u panculture data; abx as above
   - Trend Hct as post-op; already crossmatched x 4 units, maintain active
   T&S
   # Anemia: Baseline unclear but Hct 36 on admission; decreased to 26
   which may be in setting of surgical repair of tib/fib with small amount
   bloody drainage from wound vac. Now to 22 with aggressive IVF.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - Guaiac all stools
   - CVL with active T&S as above; transfuse for Hct <21
   #)Tib/Fib fx: S/p ORIF by Ortho with plan for revision on [**6-2**]. However
   will postpone given acute decompensation.
   - Fentanyl gtt/ morphine prn for pain control
   - F/u ortho recs
   # ?Syncope: Patient was involved in MVA with question of syncope prior
   to collision. Has had negative CT head and monitored on tele with no
   arrhythmia except sinus tachy thought [**1-24**] infection. EKG without
   ischemic changes. TTE negative for structural disease. No h/o syncope
   or seizures so suspicion in accident is low. Serum tox positive only
   for opioids on arrival which could be accounted for by morphine
   received at OSH.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 20-year-old female with no prior medical history who was involved in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and subsequently underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of her tibia and fibula. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the orthopedic service due to worsening hypoxia.

The patient has been sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation with assist-control mode. Her vital signs include a temperature of 39.4°C (103°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 105/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is within normal range.

She has received multiple boluses of intravenous fluids and has been started on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. Blood cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there is evidence of anemia with a hemoglobin level of 22.8 g/dL. Other lab results show normal liver function tests and electrolyte levels.

The patient's clinical condition is complicated by several issues. She has hypoxia with an unclear etiology, considered to be possibly due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), infection with atypical organisms, flu, or fat emboli. A bronchoscopy was performed to rule out infection, eos"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old obese female who was admitted with ARDS and multi-focal pneumonia. She has been intubated and sedated. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has ARDS with evidence of multi-focal pneumonia seen on CT abdomen. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 163, indicating severe hypoxia. The patient is on ventilatory support with fentanyl and versed for sedation.

2. Fever: The patient continues to spike with fever despite receiving appropriate antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam). Possible etiologies include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism/disseminated intravascular coagulation (PE/DVT), urinary tract source, surgical wound infection, and skin breakdown.

3. Hypotension: The patient has required pressors since admission to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. The patient is less hypotensive with IV fluids and levophed at 0.02 mcg/kg/min.

4. Anemia: The patient's baseline Hct is unclear, but it was 36 on admission. The Hct decreased to 22.8 yesterday morning, and the patient received 3 units packed red blood cells (pRBCs) over the day without an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old obese female with no significant past medical history who was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following a motor vehicle accident (MVA).
- She is intubated and sedated, and requires high-flow oxygen via an endotracheal tube with ventilatory support.
- The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to ongoing blood loss from a traumatic injury, but her hemoglobin concentration remains low.
- She is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and atypical coverage.
- The patient has had several episodes of hypotension requiring vasopressor support, which may be due to sepsis or ongoing blood loss.
- She continues to spike fevers despite antibiotic therapy, indicating a potential source of infection.
- The patient has a liver laceration seen on CT scan and an anemia that is not improving despite transfusions.
- There are concerns about possible complications such as deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's syncope prior to the MVA is still under investigation.
- The patient is receiving nutritional support and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). She has a history of tibial/fibula fracture and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The patient is intubated and sedated, and requires mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 15 cmH2O. She has been receiving vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), but continues to spike fevers. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and her urine test for Legionella is negative. There is evidence of multi-focal pneumonia in the lung bases seen on CT abdomen yesterday. The patient also has a grade 1 liver laceration with a small perihepatic hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and evidence of multi-focal pneumonia suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic coverage and evidence of infection may indicate sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not treated promptly.
3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's liver laceration and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia. She has a history of motor vehicle accident (MVA) and underwent orthopedic surgery (ORIF) on her tib-femur fracture. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with an endotracheal tube in place. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 400 mL, RR set at 30, PEEP at 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 60%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C (102.7°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 106/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals an intubated and sedated patient with a vac dressing in place. 

The patient has several medical complications including hypoxia with an arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 163, multi-focal pneumonia in the lung bases seen on CT abdomen, and evidence of bronchial blood/hemorrhage from right lung.

The patient is a 63-year-old male with an admission temperature of 39.3°C (102.7°F) and a current temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). The patient has been experiencing desaturation episodes in the low 90s despite repositioning and increasing FiO2 and PEEP. The patient has a history of trauma and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 60%. The patient's blood pressure is 106/59 mmHg, heart rate is 107 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient has received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but has not shown an appropriate bump in hematocrit levels. The patient's blood products include 817 mL of total output. The patient's urine output is 2355 mL with an input of 6723 mL and a balance of 4127 mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 163. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 17.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) is 22.8%, platelet count (Plt) is 177, and creatinine (Cr) is 0.7 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures are negative for flu. The patient has a grade 1 liver laceration with a small sliver of perihepatic fluid/hematoma seen on CT abdomen. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was given at 08:08 PM on [**2191-6-1**]. The patient has been started on pressors for maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient's last esophageal balloon placement was at 04:10 AM on [**2191-6-1**]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient may be at risk for the following medical complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation despite increased FiO2 and PEEP suggest the possibility of ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and positive blood cultures indicate a potential infection that could lead to sepsis.
3. Trauma-related complications: The patient's history of trauma and the presence of a liver laceration with perihepatic hematoma suggest the possibility of additional trauma-related complications.
4. Hypotension and shock: The patient's low blood pressure and the need for pressors to maintain MAP above 60 mmHg suggest the possibility"

   Assessment and Plan20 F with no PMHx s/p MVA accident and tib-fib s/p
   [**Hospital **] transferred from Ortho Service to Medicine and now MICU for
   worsening hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Still unclear etiology with ARDS physiology. Considered
   infection with atypical organisms vs fat emboli syndrome, aspiration.
   - Bronch today to r/o infection, eosinophilia and perhaps diagnose fat
   emboli syndrome
   - CXR to confirm ET tube placement as well as for interval assessment
   - Continue vanco and zosyn for coverage of HAP as well as levofloxacin
   for atypicals
   - Follow fever and WBC curve
   - F/u sputum cx, send urine legionella
   - Continue lovenox for ppx
   - Supportive ventilation with fentanyl/versed for sedation-PRN morphine
   for turns; wean as tolerated
   - F/u any Pulm recs (consulted on floor)
   - Re-attempt a-line today for repeated ABGs
   - Change tidal volumes based on height
   - consider esophageal balloon pressure today to ensure measuring lung
   compliance and not chest wall compliance given obesity
   # Hypotension: Hypotensive in setting of positive pressure on vent as
   well as sedation. Concern for sepsis in setting of infection. Better
   today after pressors and IVF.
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain MAP >60. UOP >30. CVP>12
   - Attempt to wean pressors today
   - F/u panculture data; abx as above
   - Trend Hct as post-op; already crossmatched x 4 units, maintain active
   T&S
   # Anemia: Baseline unclear but Hct 36 on admission; decreased to 26
   which may be in setting of surgical repair of tib/fib with small amount
   bloody drainage from wound vac. Now to 22 with aggressive IVF.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - Guaiac all stools
   - CVL with active T&S as above; transfuse for Hct <21
   #)Tib/Fib fx: S/p ORIF by Ortho with plan for revision on [**6-2**]. However
   will postpone given acute decompensation.
   - Fentanyl gtt/ morphine prn for pain control
   - F/u ortho recs
   # ?Syncope: Patient was involved in MVA with question of syncope prior
   to collision. Has had negative CT head and monitored on tele with no
   arrhythmia except sinus tachy thought [**1-24**] infection. EKG without
   ischemic changes. TTE negative for structural disease. No h/o syncope
   or seizures so suspicion in accident is low. Serum tox positive only
   for opioids on arrival which could be accounted for by morphine
   received at OSH.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of motor vehicle accident and tib-fib fracture, currently admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia. The patient is intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support. Vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C (102.7°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/59 mmHg to 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's medical history includes a previous injury and surgery, but no known drug allergies. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics and analgesics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxia with an unclear etiology. ARDS physiology is being considered, along with infection by atypical organisms, fat emboli syndrome, and aspiration. Bronchoscopy has been performed to rule out infection, eosinophilia, and diagnose fat emboli syndrome.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive in the setting of positive pressure ventilation and sedation, with concerns for sepsis in the context of infection. Pressors have been initiated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and IV fluids are being given as needed.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased from 36 on admission to 22 currently,"
