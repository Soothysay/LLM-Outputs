   56F with sepsis
   Sepsis: Likely due to Cdiff in setting of recent infection although on
   treatment, abdominal pain, leuckocytosis, hypotension & imaging
   suggestive of such.  Other considerations include a peritoneal
   infection.  This does not appear to be of pulmonary origin.
   - Continue PO Vanc
   - Start IV flagyl
   - Continue IV Zosyn
   - BCx pending
   - Cultures to be drawn from peritoneal catheter
   - Patient anuric thus can't measure UO as a measure of fluid status
   - Will bolus gently with NS to attempt pressor wean given ESRD.  Will
   monitor oxygen saturation.
   - CVP can't be measured off fem line
   - lactate 1.0
   Colitis/Peritonitis: this is the patients 4th infection since [**Month (only) 1088**]
   [**2127**].  She appears to be refractory to current therapy and may need
   prolonged PO Vanc taper
   - PO vanc, IV flagyl, IV Zosyn as above
   - Sacchromyces at outpatient dose
   - Consider GI consult for extended treatment protocols.
   - NPO except meds
   ESRD on PD: last HD on Wednesday, generally gets it daily. Patient
   clinically volume overloaded
   - gentle PD in am given clinical status
   SOB: likely due to volume overload given physical exam and CXR.
   Currently satting ok
   - PD in am if stable
   CV: Not suggestive ACS at this point.
   CAD: not on ASA, statin, BB. Repeat EKG on arrival. Cycle enzymes.
   PUMP: EF55%.  Hx of hypertension although not on medications and
   currently hypotensive requiring pressors.  Will bolus with NS as needed
   for pressure and attempt to wean pressors as tolerated. Not on
   antihypertensives as an outpatient.
   RHYTHM: tachycardic, may be due to decreased intravascular volume,
   infection or pulmonary edema.
   SVC Syndrome: hold warfarin given supratherapeutic INR
   Supratherapeutic INR:
   - Continue to trend, FFP and/or Vitamin K for procedures.  Patient
   currently not bleeding
   OSA: not on CPAP
   AG Metabolic Acidosis
   - likely from underlying renal failure
   - lactate 1.0

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with sepsis likely due to Clostridium difficile infection. She has been treated with various antibiotics, but continues to have leukocytosis, hypotension, and imaging suggestive of peritoneal infection. The patient also has end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis and has been refractory to current therapy for colitis/peritonitis. She is experiencing shortness of breath possibly due to volume overload, and her cardiovascular status is complicated by hypertension and an EF of 55%. The patient's rhythm is tachycardic, which could be due to decreased intravascular volume, infection, or pulmonary edema. Supratherapeutic INR requires management, and the patient's metabolic acidosis is likely from underlying renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening sepsis and septic shock due to Clostridium difficile infection.
2. Peritonitis and potential development of abscess or bowel perforation.
3. Fluid overload leading to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
4. Hypotension and decreased organ perfusion.
5. Further deterioration of renal function.
6. Cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
7. Increased risk of thromboembolic events like deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
8. Metabolic imbalances and electrolyte disturbances.
9. Infection-related complications such as ventil"

   likely due to Cdiff rather than peritonitis, although will continue
   broad spectrum abx until cultures are negative after 48 hours.  First
   set of abx that should be pulled off are IV Vanc and Zosyn which are
   being used to treat empirically for peritonitis.

   Altered Mental Status: Patient delirious this morning, a change from

   favor the latter given that her admission Head CT was negative,
   although this doesn
t definitively rule out a head  bleed, but there
   has been no trauma.  She was on BiPaP overnight, which should keep her
   from getting hypercarbic.
   - Will follow and start with ABG if she does not clear
   - Head CT if patient does not clear within 24 hours
   ESRD on PD: last HD on Wednesday, generally gets it daily. Patient
   clinically volume overloaded

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) colitis, who was recently discharged and readmitted with abdominal pain and increased diarrhea. The patient is hypotensive and requires norepinephrine infusion. The patient has been treated with oral vancomycin, intravenous Flagyl for C. Diff, and intravenous vancomycin/Zosyn to cover for peritoneal infection and other infectious colitis. The patient remains on norepinephrine and has received 2 liters of normal saline (NS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CV/ID - septic shock, possible sources: C. Diff, peritonitis, other infectious colitis.
   - The patient's hypotension and requirement for norepinephrine suggest septic shock.
   - C. Diff, peritonitis, and other infectious colitis are potential sources of infection.
   - Bolusing with NS and monitoring blood pressure effect.
   - Considering arterial line placement if not improving but holding off due to high INR.
   - Transducing femoral CVP.
   - Stool cultures and C. Diff testing.
   - Getting peritoneal culture.
   - Switching to intraperitoneal vancomycin and stopping Zosyn if no other positive culture data in 48"

   Assessment and Plan
   56F with sepsis
   # Sepsis:  Likely due to Cdiff in setting of recent infection although
   on treatment, abdominal pain, leuckocytosis, hypotension & imaging
   suggestive of such.  Other considerations include a peritoneal
   infection.  This does not appear to be of pulmonary origin.  This is
   likely due to Cdiff rather than peritonitis, although will continue
   broad spectrum abx until cultures are negative after 48 hours.  First
   set of abx that should be pulled off are IV Vanc and Zosyn which are
   being used to treat empirically for peritonitis.
   - Continue PO Vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff
   - Continue IV Zosyn/IV Vanc
   - BCx pending
   - Attempt peritoneal culture
   - Cultures to be drawn from peritoneal catheter
   - Patient anuric thus can't measure UO as a measure of fluid status
   - Will bolus gently with NS to attempt pressor wean given ESRD.  Will
   monitor oxygen saturation.
   - CVP can't be measured off fem line
   # Colitis/Peritonitis: this is the patients 4th infection since
   [**2127-12-26**].  She appears to be refractory to current therapy and may
   need prolonged PO Vanc taper
   - PO vanc, IV flagyl, IV Zosyn as above
   - Sacchromyces at outpatient dose
   - NPO except meds
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient delirious this morning, a change from
   admission.  Etiologies include underlying infection, ICH in setting of
   supratherapeutic INR, hypercarbia, ICU delirium from not sleeping.  I
   favor the latter given that her admission Head CT was negative,
   although this doesn
t definitively rule out a head  bleed, but there
   has been no trauma.  She was on BiPaP overnight, which should keep her
   from getting hypercarbic.
   - Will follow and start with ABG if she does not clear
   - Head CT if patient does not clear within 24 hours
   # ESRD on PD: last HD on Wednesday, generally gets it daily. Patient
   clinically volume overloaded
   - gentle PD once patient off pressors
   # SOB: likely due to volume overload given physical exam and CXR.
   Currently satting ok
   - PD when stable
   # CV: Not suggestive ACS at this point.
   CAD: not on ASA, statin, BB. Repeat EKG on arrival. Cycle enzymes.
   PUMP: EF55%.  Hx of hypertension although not on medications and
   currently hypotensive requiring pressors.  Will bolus with NS as needed
   for pressure and attempt to wean pressors as tolerated. Not on
   antihypertensives as an outpatient.
   RHYTHM: tachycardic, may be due to decreased intravascular volume,
   infection or pulmonary edema.
   # SVC Syndrome: hold warfarin given supratherapeutic INR
   - Vitamin K
   - FFP  prior to procedures
   # OSA: BiPap at night

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the infection. There are concerns for possible tamponade physiology, but a TTE did not show any significant pericardial effusion. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and requires pressors. She also has an altered mental status, likely due to infection or ICU delirium. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She is volume overloaded and requires gentle PD once off pressors. The patient is also experiencing shortness of breath (SOB), which is likely due to volume overload. Cardiovascular assessments show no signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has a history of hypertension and is not currently on antihypertensive medications. There is a concern for SVC syndrome, so warfarin has been held. The patient is also experiencing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and will be on BiPap at night. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, possibly in the setting of recent antibiotic use. The patient may be refractory to current therapy and may require prolonged treatment with oral vancomycin (Vanc) taper."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with sepsis, likely due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection in the setting of recent antibiotic use. The patient has been treated for C. diff with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. Imaging suggests right lung pneumonia, and a cardiac ultrasound did not show any significant pericardial effusion or tamponade physiology. The patient has been receiving 500 ml normal saline (NS) boluses, and gabapentin has been held per renal recommendation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/54 mmHg to 116/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving norepinephrine at a dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/min. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. C. diff infection: The patient's sepsis is likely due to a C. diff infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and even death if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Right lung pneumonia:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), colitis, recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, sepsis, possible peritonitis, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He has severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. The patient presents with altered mental status, shock likely due to sepsis, and is partly fluid-responsive. His source of infection is suspected to be colitis, recurrent C. difficile, right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia, and peritonitis. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of recurrent C. difficile infection, which can lead to severe colitis and may progress to toxic megacolon, sepsis, or perforation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis due to the combination of infections, including C. difficile colitis, RLL pneumonia, and possible peritonitis. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not promptly treated.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management with PD"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), colitis, recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, sepsis, possible peritonitis, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome on anticoagulation. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for management of sepsis and other conditions.

Key findings and assessments from the note include:

1. The patient has altered mental status, which is attributed to sepsis, uremia, and possibly adrenal insufficiency. A CT head was performed and was negative. The patient's ABG should be checked, and a lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered if there are signs of central nervous system infection.

2. The patient has ESRD on PD. PD will be continued as part of the ongoing management.

3. The patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) will be continued to manage OSA.

4. The patient has cardiac issues, including potential right heart failure and SVC syndrome. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be done to assess the cardiac function.

5. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated due to the presence of SVC syndrome. However, since the patient is now more stable, the plan is to stop sub"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Sepsis:  Likely due to Cdiff in setting of recent infection although
   on treatment, abdominal pain, leuckocytosis, hypotension & imaging
   suggestive of such.  Other considerations include a peritoneal
   infection however gram stain of peritoneal fluid does not support
   infection but culture is pending.  ? Right base PNA.   Cardiology
   fellow TTE overnight did not show any significant pericardial effusion
   or tamponade physiology.
   - Continue PO Vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff
   - patient is still requiring pressors
   - patient is volume sensitive transiently however getting fluid
   overloaded, ? albumin
   - Continue IV Zosyn/IV Vanc for HAP, ? double coverage
   - BCx pending
   - Will bolus gently with NS to attempt pressor wean given ESRD.  Will
   monitor oxygen saturation.
   -  will check random cortisol for adrenal isufficiency
   - will check IG levels if infact c diff is causing his sepsis
   # Colitis/Peritonitis: this is the patients 4th infection since
   [**2127-12-26**].  She appears to be refractory to current therapy and may
   need prolonged PO Vanc taper
   - abx as above
   - NPO except meds
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient delirious this morning, a change from
   admission.  Most likely due to underlying infection. Admission Head CT
   was negative.  She was on BiPaP overnight, which should keep her from
   getting hypercarbic.
   - check ABG for hypercapnia
   # ESRD on PD: last HD on Wednesday, generally gets it daily. Patient
   clinically volume overloaded
   - PD per renal team
   # SVC Syndrome: hold warfarin given supratherapeutic INR.  Received one
   dose of vanc 1 mg IV yesterday.
   - ? FFP  prior to procedures
   - trend INR
   - may need to restart coumadin vs. heparin gtt (if procedures are
   planned)
   # OSA: BiPap at night
   # FEN: NPO for now; replete lytes prn
   # PPx: supratherapeutic INR, PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis likely due to Clostridium difficile infection, refractory colitis/peritonitis, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, SVC syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and potential fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/66 to 94/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 19.3 to 19.4 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine levels between 10.7 and 11.4 mg/dL, and platelet counts between 407 and 438 thousand/mm3. Other lab results indicate hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate levels"

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and worsening mental status. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea, renal failure (end stage renal disease), and Clostridium difficile infection. They were admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient received intravenous fluids and antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), metronidazole, and levofloxacin. The patient is currently on fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation, respectively. Norepinephrine is being used to maintain blood pressure.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 100/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring includes a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 94 mmHg. Fluid balance reveals an input of 1,599 mL and output of 1,600 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,199 mL.

Respiratory support consists of mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Blood gases indicate a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 305 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 6.9 L/min.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 10.7 to 11.4 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.3 mmol/L. The patient also has hyponatremia with a sodium (Na+) level of 101 mEq/L and hyperkalemia with a potassium (K+) level of 5.3 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings are not provided in the progress note.

The patient's plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, administering appropriate antibiotics, and providing supportive care. The patient is expected to remain intubated for at least 24 hours and will need to be sitting up prior to extubation due to a possible case of angioedema during intubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), delirium, nosocomial infections, and worsening renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Sepsis:  Likely due to Cdiff in setting of recent infection although
   on treatment, abdominal pain, leuckocytosis, hypotension & imaging
   suggestive of such.  Other considerations include a peritoneal
   infection however gram stain of peritoneal fluid does not support
   infection but culture is pending.  ? Right base PNA.   Cardiology
   fellow TTE overnight did not show any significant pericardial effusion
   or tamponade physiology.
   - Continue PO Vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff
   - patient is still requiring pressors
   - patient is volume sensitive transiently however getting fluid
   overloaded, ? albumin
   - Continue IV Zosyn/IV Vanc for HAP, ? double coverage
   - BCx pending
   - Will bolus gently with NS to attempt pressor wean given ESRD.  Will
   monitor oxygen saturation.
   -  will check random cortisol for adrenal isufficiency
   - will check IG levels if infact c diff is causing his sepsis
   # Colitis/Peritonitis: this is the patients 4th infection since
   [**2127-12-26**].  She appears to be refractory to current therapy and may
   need prolonged PO Vanc taper
   - abx as above
   - NPO except meds
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient delirious this morning, a change from
   admission.  Most likely due to underlying infection. Admission Head CT
   was negative.  She was on BiPaP overnight, which should keep her from
   getting hypercarbic.
   - check ABG for hypercapnia
   # ESRD on PD: last HD on Wednesday, generally gets it daily. Patient
   clinically volume overloaded
   - PD per renal team
   # SVC Syndrome: hold warfarin given supratherapeutic INR.  Received one
   dose of vanc 1 mg IV yesterday.
   - ? FFP  prior to procedures
   - trend INR
   - may need to restart coumadin vs. heparin gtt (if procedures are
   planned)
   # OSA: BiPap at night
   # FEN: NPO for now; replete lytes prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and worsening mental status.
- She has been receiving various antibiotics for suspected infections, including C. difficile, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and peritoneal infection.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation and requires pressors for blood pressure support.
- She has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on peritoneal dialysis.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging suggests the possibility of sepsis and peritoneal infection.
- The patient has altered mental status, likely due to an underlying infection.
- She has a femoral line in place for vascular access.
- The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and warfarin has been held.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation and laboratory findings suggest sepsis, likely due to C. difficile infection. She is already on treatment but remains critically ill.
2. Peritoneal Infection: Although the gram stain of peritoneal fluid does not support infection, the patient's symptoms and imaging suggest a possible peritoneal infection.
3. Right Lower Lobe Pneumonia: Imaging findings are suggestive of right base pneumonia.
4. Volume Overload: The patient is volume sensitive and at risk of fluid overload, especially considering her ESRD.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), colitis, recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, sepsis, and evolving right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia. The patient presented to the hospital with symptoms of respiratory failure, altered mental status, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and C. difficile infection.

The patient was initially managed with invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory acidosis worsened, along with the development of soft tissue edema during intubation. Thick yellow endotracheal tube (ETT) secretions were also noted.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute (mechanically ventilated), oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 of 40%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 29 mmHg. The patient is receiving multiple intravenous medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, and various antibiotics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea, end-stage renal disease, and diabetes mellitus. He presented to the hospital with altered mental status and was found to have sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has been in the ICU for 3 days and is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 79/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals facial and tongue edema, as well as diminished breath sounds bilaterally. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, and lactic acid level. Imaging reveals bibasilar consolidations and small bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's microbiology results are negative for any microorganisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to the presence of bibasilar consolidations and small bilateral pleural effusions seen on imaging. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status needs to be closely monitored for potential progression to delirium or coma. Early recognition and management of any changes"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with ESRD on PD who presents with RML pneumonia
   # Hypotension:  Septic phyisiology is presumed secondary to RML
   pneumonia vs. recurrent C. diff infection.
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin (day #5), Zosyn
   (day#5), Levofloxacin (day#3) for HAP
   - Continue PO Vanc as empiric coverage for presumed recurrent C diff
   - Vancomycin to be dosed to goal trough 15-20
   - wean Levophed to goal MAP > 65
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine, and peritoneal fluid cultures
    - no adrenal insufficiency by [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   # Respiratory failure:  Presumed secondary to pneumonia.  CT chest
   revealed bilateral infiltrates.
   - Currently tolerating [**3-29**] but with no cuff leak.  Will give Decadron
   to reduced risk of post-extubation stridor given concern for laryngeal
   edema.
   - f/u endotracheal sputum cx
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin (day #5), Zosyn
   (day#5), Levofloxacin (day#3) for HAP
   - Legionella ab negative
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Recurrent C. diff colitis:  Recurrent infections since [**Month (only) 1088**]
   [**2127**].  Cdiff toxin negative this admission.
   - continue PO vancomycin as empiric therapy while patient is on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics
   # ESRD on PD:
   - Continue PD today, as per Renal recommendations, with plan for net
   negative fluid balance
   - Sevelamer, Cinacalcet, Lanthanum held while NPO
   # SVC Syndrome:  INR is currently supratherapeutic at >4.  Presume
   worsening facial edema is secondary to volume overload and intubation.
   - resume coumadin once INR trending down.
   # OSA: currently intubated, willl resume BiPap at night s/p extubation
   # FEN:
   - NPO for now, pending extubation
   - Replete K with PD
   # PPx:
   - Supratherapeutic INR as DVT prophylaxis.
   - Change PPI to lansoprazole
   # Access:
   - Femoral CVL placed [**1-15**], as IJ and subclavian CVL contraindicated by
   SVC syndrome.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD) who presents with right middle lobe (RML) pneumonia. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, septic physiology, and hypotension. She has a history of recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

24-hour events:
- Sevelamer, Lanthanum, and Cinacalcet were held while the patient was NPO.
- Discontinued IV Flagyl.
- Started Calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily.
- PD modified to achieve a net negative fluid balance.
- Patient's sedation level improved from 12 to 22.
- CT chest was done.
- Weaned off Levophed.
- Changed to pressure support (PS) 4-1 at 3 AM.
- The patient is awake and following commands.
- Subjectively noticed increased facial and tongue edema.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Small bilateral bibasilar consolidation, right greater than left.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Cardiomegaly.

The patient is presumed to have respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Vancomycin is being dosed to a goal trough of 15-20 due to suspected recurrent C. diff infection. Levophed"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yr old ESRD, admitted with sepsis of unclear etiology, possibly
   cdiff vs RLL pneumonia. She was intubated for altered mental status
   likely due to hypercapneic resp failure. Sputum cultures negative. CT
   chest yesterday was reviewed Levophed weaned off but back at 0.02
   mcg/kg/min. Mental status is signifcantly improved, tolerating PSV 5/5,
   40% O2. On exam, she's intubated, awake and alert, responds to
   commands, good cough, decreased gag, small amt of thick secretions,
   neck swollen, bilat breath sounds ant/lat. She seems ready to extubate
   but will treat with steroids empirically for swelling, which may all be
   due to SVC. Will recheck for cuff-leak and when deemed ready, will ask
   anesthesia to be around during extubation.

","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis, SVC syndrome, and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. She presented with diarrhea, hypotension, and required intubation for altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated, awake, alert, and follows commands. She has improved respiratory status and decreased swelling in the neck. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactic acid levels. Chest X-ray revealed progressive infiltrate. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, steroids empirically for swelling, and continued peritoneal dialysis. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (due to immunocompromised state and indwelling lines), and further deterioration of renal function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to pneumonia and septic shock. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has required norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is currently preparing for extubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his blood pressure is low and requires close monitoring. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient's serum albumin is low, and he has borderline anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients are at risk of stress-related mucosal disease. Proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists may be necessary to prevent gastric ulcers.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite fluid resuscitation and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis who presents with right middle lobe (RML) pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She also has hypotension, which is presumed to be secondary to septic physiology from the pneumonia or recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff colitis and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, Zosyn, and levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is also receiving empiric coverage for presumed recurrent C. diff with oral vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate septic shock secondary to the RML pneumonia or recurrent C. diff infection. Continuous monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation are required to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously, monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress or worsening gas exchange.
3. Recurrent C. diff Colitis: Although the patient's current C. diff toxin test is negative, there is a history of recurrent C. diff infections. Continued empiric therapy with oral vancomycin is necessary to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with ESRD on PD who presents with RML pneumonia
   # Hypotension:  Septic phyisiology is presumed secondary to RML
   pneumonia vs. recurrent C. diff infection.
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin (day #6), Zosyn
   (day#6), Levofloxacin (day#4) for HAP
   - Continue PO Vanc as empiric coverage for presumed recurrent C diff
   - Vancomycin to be dosed to goal trough 15-20
   - wean Levophed to goal MAP > 60
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine, and peritoneal fluid cultures
    - no adrenal insufficiency by [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   # Respiratory failure:  Presumed secondary to pneumonia.  CT chest
   revealed bilateral infiltrates.
   - Currently tolerating [**3-29**] but with no cuff leak.  Will give Decadron
   to reduced risk of post-extubation stridor given concern for laryngeal
   edema.   Will attempt extubation if there is some cuff leak with
   anesthesia at bedside.
   - f/u endotracheal sputum cx
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin (day #5), Zosyn
   (day#5), Levofloxacin (day#3) for HAP
   - Legionella ab negative
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Recurrent C. diff colitis:  Recurrent infections since [**Month (only) 1088**]
   [**2127**].  Cdiff toxin negative this admission.
   - continue PO vancomycin as empiric therapy while patient is on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics
   # ESRD on PD:
   - Continue PD today, as per Renal recommendations, with plan for net
   negative fluid balance if possible
   - Sevelamer, Cinacalcet, Lanthanum held while NPO
   # SVC Syndrome:  INR is currently supratherapeutic at >5.
   - resume coumadin once INR improves.
   # OSA: currently intubated, willl resume BiPap at night s/p extubation
   # Elevated INR: Was on coumadin, now most likely in the setting of poor
   nutrition and abx (esp levo).
   - TF post extubation
   # FEN:
   - NPO for now for possible extubation, if unable to extubate today,
   will need to start TF
   - Replete K with PD
   # PPx:
   - Supratherapeutic INR as DVT prophylaxis.
   - Change PPI to lansoprazole
   # Access:
   - Femoral CVL placed [**1-15**], as IJ and subclavian CVL contraindicated by
   SVC syndrome.
   - A-line placed [**1-17**].
   # Dispo: ICU for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis who presents with right middle lobe (RML) pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, SVC syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), elevated INR, and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating possible septic physiology secondary to RML pneumonia or recurrent C. diff infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on CT chest, indicating respiratory failure presumed to be secondary to pneumonia.
3. Recurrent C. diff Colitis: The patient has had recurrent C. diff infections since [Month 1088]. Cdiff toxin is negative this admission.
4. SVC Syndrome: The patient has supratherapeutic INR due to coumadin use, which may be contributing to SVC syndrome.
5. OSA: The patient has obstructive sleep apnea and is currently intubated. BiPap therapy will be resumed at night post-extubation.
6. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated and was previously on coumadin. This could be due to poor nutrition and antibiotic use.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, indicating fluid overload.
8. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient requires supratherapeutic INR as DVT prophylaxis, and PPI will be changed to lansoprazole.
9. Access: The patient has a femoral central venous line placed due to contraindications with internal jugular and subclavian CVLs. An arterial line was also placed.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information and may not include all possible medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yr old ESRD, admitted with sepsis of unclear etiology, possibly
   cdiff vs RLL pneumonia. She was intubated for altered mental status
   likely due to hypercapneic resp failure. Sputum cultures negative. CT
   chest was reviewed. Levophed weaned off but back at 0.02 mcg/kg/min.
   Mental status is signifcantly improved, tolerating PSV 5/5, 40% O2,
   RSBI 18. On exam, she's intubated, awake and alert, responds to
   commands, good cough, small amt of thick secretions, neck less swollen,
   bilat breath sounds ant/lat. She seems ready to extubate. Was treated
   24 hrs of decadron empirically for swelling, which may all be due to
   SVC. Will recheck for cuff-leak before deciding on extubation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), who presents with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and acute respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status likely due to SVC syndrome, and ongoing requirements for vasoactive medications. She has a history of renal failure, C. diff infection, and OSA. The patient is critically ill and requires intensive care management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to her underlying conditions, requires close monitoring and management of her ventilator settings. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other complications associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage, the patient remains septic and requires careful monitoring of her vital signs and hemodynamic status. There is a risk of progression to septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. SVC syndrome: The patient's SVC syndrome can lead to compromised blood flow and swelling in the upper extremities, face, and neck. Close monitoring of symptoms and potential interventions such as corticosteroids or radiation therapy may be necessary.
4. C. diff infection: The patient's recurrent C. diff"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with ESRD on PD who presents with RML pneumonia
   # Hypotension:  Septic phyisiology is presumed secondary to RML
   pneumonia vs. recurrent C. diff infection.
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin (day #6), Zosyn
   (day#6), Levofloxacin (day#4) for HAP
   - Continue PO Vanc as empiric coverage for presumed recurrent C diff
   - Vancomycin to be dosed to goal trough 15-20
   - wean Levophed to goal MAP > 60
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine, and peritoneal fluid cultures
    - no adrenal insufficiency by [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   # Respiratory failure:  Presumed secondary to pneumonia.  CT chest
   revealed bilateral infiltrates.
   - Currently tolerating [**3-29**] but with no cuff leak.  Will give Decadron
   to reduced risk of post-extubation stridor given concern for laryngeal
   edema.   Will attempt extubation if there is some cuff leak with
   anesthesia at bedside.
   - f/u endotracheal sputum cx
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin (day #5), Zosyn
   (day#5), Levofloxacin (day#3) for HAP
   - Legionella ab negative
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Recurrent C. diff colitis:  Recurrent infections since [**Month (only) 1088**]
   [**2127**].  Cdiff toxin negative this admission.
   - continue PO vancomycin as empiric therapy while patient is on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics
   # ESRD on PD:
   - Continue PD today, as per Renal recommendations, with plan for net
   negative fluid balance if possible
   - Sevelamer, Cinacalcet, Lanthanum held while NPO
   # SVC Syndrome:  INR is currently supratherapeutic at >5.
   - resume coumadin once INR improves.
   # OSA: currently intubated, willl resume BiPap at night s/p extubation
   # Elevated INR: Was on coumadin, now most likely in the setting of poor
   nutrition and abx (esp levo).
   - TF post extubation
   # FEN:
   - NPO for now for possible extubation, if unable to extubate today,
   will need to start TF
   - Replete K with PD
   # PPx:
   - Supratherapeutic INR as DVT prophylaxis.
   - Change PPI to lansoprazole
   # Access:
   - Femoral CVL placed [**1-15**], as IJ and subclavian CVL contraindicated by
   SVC syndrome.
   - A-line placed [**1-17**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD) who presents with right middle lobe (RML) pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently extubated. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 84/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on bipap mask. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), empiric coverage for presumed recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and anticoagulation with warfarin. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactic acid levels, and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals bilateral infiltrates on CT chest, consistent with pneumonia. The patient is planned for extubation if there is some cuff leak during anesthesia at the bedside. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This may be secondary to septic physiology due to RML pneumonia or recurrent C. diff infection. 
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure presumed secondary to pneumonia, as indicated by bilateral infiltrates on CT chest. She is currently tolerating bipap but without cuff leak, and there is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with ESRD on PD who presents with RML pneumonia
   # Hypotension:  Septic phyisiology is presumed secondary to RML
   pneumonia vs. recurrent C. diff infection.   Weaned off of pressors
   overnight.  Her target MAP > 55, not really following SBPs.
   - broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin (day #7) and  Zosyn
   (day#7) to complete 7 day course today
   - Levofloxacin (day#5) for atypical coverage, should be on for 14 day
   course
   - Continue PO Vanc as empiric coverage for presumed recurrent C diff,
   needs to be continued for atleast 2 weeks post completion of other
   antibiotics
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine, and peritoneal fluid cultures
    - no adrenal insufficiency by [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   # Respiratory failure:  Presumed secondary to pneumonia.  Successfully
   extubated.   Has a difficult airway given SVC syndrome.
   - abx as above
   - Legionella ab negative
   # Recurrent C. diff colitis:  Recurrent infections since [**Month (only) 1088**]
   [**2127**].  Cdiff toxin negative this admission.
   - continue PO vancomycin as empiric therapy while patient is on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics, need to be on oral vanc for 2-4 weeks after
   discontinuation of other antibiotics
   # ESRD on PD:
   - PD per Renal recommendations, with plan for net negative fluid
   balance if possible
   - Sevelamer, Cinacalcet, Lanthanum held while NPO
   # SVC Syndrome:  INR is currently supratherapeutic at >6.    Most
   likely due to poor nutrition and use of levofloxacin.
   - resume coumadin once INR improves.
   - no need to reverse  unless actively bleeding
   - starting oral food today
   # OSA: Bipap at night, 17/14
   # Elevated INR: as mentioned above
   # FEN:
   - advancing diet, renal diet
   - Replete K with PD
   # PPx:
   - Supratherapeutic INR as DVT prophylaxis.
   - lansoprazole
   # Access:
   - Femoral CVL placed [**1-15**], as IJ and subclavian CVL contraindicated by
   SVC syndrome.
   - A-line placed [**1-17**] will be removed prior to transfer to the floor
   # Dispo: To the floor today

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis who presented with right middle lobe (RML) pneumonia. She is hypotensive, presumed to be secondary to septic physiology from RML pneumonia or recurrent Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She has been weaned off pressors overnight. The patient's target mean arterial pressure (MAP) is greater than 55, but her systolic blood pressures (SBPs) are not following. She is being given broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and Zosyn to complete a 7-day course. Levofloxacin has also been initiated for atypical coverage and should be continued for a 14-day course. The patient's blood, sputum, urine, and peritoneal fluid cultures will be followed up. There is no evidence of adrenal insufficiency based on the [Last Name] stim test.

The patient has respiratory failure presumed to be secondary to pneumonia. She has successfully been extubated, but has a difficult airway due to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The same antibiotics mentioned above will be given, and Legionella antibody testing has come back negative.

The patient has a history of recurrent C. diff colitis since [Month] 1088. She will continue taking oral vancomycin as empiric therapy while on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and this should be"

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and C. difficile infection. He presented to the ICU with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient was extubated today and is now on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with a BiPAP mask. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/61 mmHg to 105/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on FiO2 21%. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1900 mL since 12 AM. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels, along with low hemoglobin and potassium levels. The patient's care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's condition remains stable, and he is expected to continue improving. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with a BiPAP mask, there is a risk of developing VAP due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis, superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was admitted with diarrhea, hypotension, oliguria, and on levophed support. She has been intubated for respiratory acidosis and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis, which is now resolved, as well as C. difficile infection, for which she completed 7 days of vancomycin and zosyn. She also completed 14 days of levofloxacin for possible community-acquired pneumonia. Other ongoing issues include ESRD, chronic SVC syndrome, OSA, and a right shoulder pain due to a rotator cuff injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is currently resolved, but there is a risk of recurrence, especially if she develops another infection while in the ICU.
2. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent C. difficile infection, and if not properly managed, she may experience further episodes of diarrhea and colitis.
3. ESRD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management with peritoneal dialysis. Complications such as peritonitis or fluid imbalances can occur.
4. SVC Syndrome: The patient's SVC"
