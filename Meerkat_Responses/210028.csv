   showed progression of disease, but no tracheal deviation or signs of

   evidence of pna.  ENT consulted and rec 10mg decadron x3 and monitor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the lungs and brain. The patient has been admitted for increased neck swelling with worsened neck lymphadenopathy (LAD) and neck mass, accompanied by stridor and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 112/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and intubated.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 3.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 426 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 29.6 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and glucose level of 157 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals cervical adenopathy"

- The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the lungs and brain.
- He was admitted for increased neck swelling with worsened neck lymphadenopathy (LAD) and neck mass, along with symptoms of stridor and respiratory failure.
- The patient has been intubated and sedated.
- Imaging shows progression of disease, but no tracheal deviation or signs of compression.
- The patient's recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.41, pCO2 of 44, pO2 of 147, and HCO3 of 29.
- The patient is afebrile with no evidence of pneumonia.
- ENT consulted and recommended dexamethasone to reduce extrinsic compression and monitoring for cuff leakage.
- A family meeting was held to discuss possible comfort measures only (CMO) and to define goals of care.
- It was decided to continue dexamethasone at 4 mg IV q6 to reduce extrinsic compression and discuss with oncology regarding increasing the dose to 10 mg x3.
- ENT and interventional pulmonology/thoracic consults will be followed up regarding tracheostomy if the family agrees with aggressive management, otherwise, it will be held off for now.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 57yoM metastatic RCC to lungs/brain, recently admitted for
   increased neck swelling with worsened neck LAD and neck mass, p/w
   stridor and respiratory failuire.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma and
   recent imaging shows worsening of disease. CT-neck performed yesterday
   showed progression of disease, but no tracheal deviation or signs of
   compression.  Yesterday the patient p/w resp distress, inspiratory
   stridor and neck swelling likely due to extrinsic compression from
   bulky LAD and IJ clots. Patient continues to be intubated and sedated.
   Most recent ABG: pH 7.41 pCO2 44 pO2 147 HCO3 29. Afebrile with no
   evidence of pna.  ENT consulted and rec 10mg decadron x3 and monitor
   for cuff leakage.  Also, suggested evaluation by IP/Thoracics for
   possible tracheostomy to bypass compression.  However, family meeting
   today to discuss possible [**Month/Year (2) 617**].
   - family meeting today to define goals of care and possible [**Month/Year (2) 617**]
   - will f/u with oncology
   - cont decadron 4 mg IV q 6 to reduce extrinsic compression, will d/w
   onc regarding increasing to 10mg x3
   -will f/u with ENT, t/c IP/thoracics consult regarding trach if family
   agreeable for aggressive management, otherwise will hold off for now
   .
   # IJ/Subclavian/brachiocephalic DVT - had venous clots on previous
   admission, noted on imaging, +risk factors despite lovenox therapy.  No
   evidence of hemorrhage
   - Continue lovenox 100 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # RCC - as above, mets to lungs and brain - brain mets now s/p
   resection and cyberknife; s/p multiple rounds of chemotherapy. Most
   recently on study drug ABT 869.
   - further management per primary oncology team
   .
   # R venous sinus thrombosis: neuro exam nonfocal currently.
   - lovenox as above
   .
   # Hypertension: patient borderline hypotensive after sedation yesterday
   and receivied IVF.
   - Will hold all bp meds for now and restart when stable.
   .
   # hypothyroidism: cont levothyroxine at home dosage
   .
   # GERD: ppi [**Hospital1 **] per home regimen
   .
   # fEN: NPO, place OG tube, IVF to keep MAP > 65 and UO > 30 cc/hr, keep
   mg>2, k>4.
   .
   # PPx: lovenox. PPI
   .
   # access: PIV x2,

   Addendum:
   Spoke with patient
s family and patient himself was able to communicate
   his wishes to become [**Year (4 digits) 617**].  The rest of the family and friends will come
   by for the rest of the day to say their good-byes.   We will d/c all
   medications that will not benefit the patient
s comfort and no longer
   draw labs. The patient will continue to be intubated at this time.  The
   patient has upper airway compromise and removing the ET tube would
   result in severe distress.  The patient will have to be heavily sedated
   for withdrawl.  The plan is to discuss with the family how to best
   remove care.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the lungs and brain. He was recently admitted for increased neck swelling, worsened neck lymphadenopathy (LAD), stridor, and respiratory failure. The patient underwent a CT-neck that showed progression of disease but no tracheal deviation or signs of compression. He continues to be intubated and sedated. The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.41, pCO2 44, pO2 147, and HCO3 29. The patient is afebrile with no evidence of pneumonia. The ENT consulted and recommended monitoring for cuff leakage and evaluation by IP/Thoracics for possible tracheostomy to bypass compression. However, a family meeting will be held today to discuss possible [Month/Year (2) 617]. The patient's goals of care will be defined, and possible [Month/Year (2) 617] will be discussed. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, and lovenox. The patient has a history of RCC, brain metastasis now post resection and cyberknife, multiple rounds of chemotherapy, and currently on study drug ABT 869. Further management will be per primary oncology team. The patient also has a history of venous sinus thrombosis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, GERD,"
