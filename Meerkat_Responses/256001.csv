   respiratory failure [**1-7**] post-obstructive PNA
   24 Hour Events:
   In summary, this is a 72 y/o male with COPD, CAD s/p angioplasty in
   [**2180**], afib and small cell lung CA who started [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 2007**] [**8-19**] with
   carboplatin/VP-16 in [**State 395**].  He initially presented to SMMC on [**8-23**]
   with hypotension after accidental overdose on diltiazem.  There, a CXR
   showed R lung white out and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for bronch given
   concern for mass compression of the bronchus.  Chest CT at [**Hospital1 19**] showed
   large centrally obstructing mass with right apical pneumothorax, right
   middle and lower lobe opacity, pigtail was placed.  Patient was then
   bronched on [**8-24**] with purulent drainage, stent was placed and started
   on Vanco/Zosyn for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia.  Patient
   continued to be intubated after the bronch and developed hypotension
   requiring pressors.  Patient also noted to be neutropenic thought
   likely [**1-7**] [**Month/Day (2) 2007**] and sepsis and patient with afib with RVR on a dilt
   gtt.  This morning he was mapped for XRT and received his first dose of
   radiation.

   Assessment and Plan:  72 year old male with COPD, CAD initially
   presented with hypotension [**1-7**] diltiazem overdose, noted to have
   post-obstructive PNA requiring bronch and stent placement, PNX
   requiring chest tube placement, transferred from SICU for XRT with
   continued hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension requiring
   pressors.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for his procedure and
   not able to be weaned.  Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive
   PNA, PNX, and underlying lung disease (COPD).
   -continue nebs but d/c fluticasone
   -Wean Vent as tolerated
   -BNP, consider ECHO
   #Hypotension: [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal. Likely sepsis, though ?diltiazem for
   afib with RVR.
   -repeat blood cultures
   -U/A with urine culture
   -f/u sputum cultures
   -change propofol to fent/midaz
   #Pneumothorax:
   -continue chest tube
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**1-7**] [**Month/Day (2) 2007**] and sepsis. Patient has been
   normo-temperature.
   -transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <10
   -neutropenic precautions
   -continue neupogen
   #Transaminitis: LFTs trending down, likely due to shock on top of known
   liver mets.
   -RUQ U/S
   #Afib: goal HR <100, on sotalol [**Hospital1 7**], holding anticoagulation given
   thrombocytopenia
   #Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc, would be due for next round of
   [**Hospital1 2007**] next week, but pending return of his counts.  Had head CT with
   and without and no mets.  Undergoing XRT.
   #?sinusitis seen on CT head.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for radiation therapy and has been experiencing respiratory failure post-obstructive pneumonia, pneumothorax, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 125/68 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show pancytopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 47. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine). The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for hyperkalemia (potassium level of 5.7 mEq/L).

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumothorax, delirium/confusion, hyperkalemia, atrial fibrillation, and acute pleural effusion. The patient's condition is likely multifactorial, involving post-obstructive pneumonia, pneumothorax, underlying lung disease (COPD), and sepsis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and obstructive pneumonia. The patient has been receiving treatment with carboplatin/VP-16 for his cancer. He initially presented with hypotension after an accidental overdose on diltiazem. A chest X-ray showed a right lung whiteout, indicating a large centrally obstructing mass with right apical pneumothorax, right middle and lower lobe opacity, and a pigtail was placed. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with purulent drainage, stent placement, and started on Vanco/Zosyn for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient continued to be intubated and developed hypotension requiring pressors. He also had neutropenia and sepsis, along with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 125/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 39 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 320, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 27 mL/kg/min. 

Physical examination reveals symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds on the left side, and diminished breath sounds on the right side. The patient has no lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.5 g/dL, elevated potassium levels of 5.7 mEq/L, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure and continued need for mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for respiratory complications. 

2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with post-obstructive pneumonia and is receiving antibiotic therapy. However, due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged intubation, he remains at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium/confusion, which can be associated with sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, and sedative medications.

4. Hypotension: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and small cell lung cancer. He presented to the hospital with hypotension after an accidental overdose of diltiazem. The patient was found to have a large centrally obstructing mass in the right lung with right apical pneumothorax, right middle and lower lobe opacity. He underwent bronchoscopy with stent placement and received treatment for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient developed hypotension requiring pressors and neutropenia. He was intubated and received his first dose of radiation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in weaning off the ventilator due to underlying lung disease (COPD), post-obstructive pneumonia, and pneumothorax.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis or the effects of diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has an ongoing pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing low levels of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, which may be secondary to sepsis and chemotherapy.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be related to shock or liver metastases"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history including COPD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and small cell lung cancer. The patient presented to the hospital with hypotension following an accidental overdose of diltiazem. Subsequently, he was found to have a large centrally obstructing mass in the right lung, leading to pneumothorax and post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient underwent bronchoscopic intervention with stent placement and received antibiotics for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia. Despite these interventions, the patient continued to experience hypoxic respiratory failure and required invasive ventilation. He also developed hypotension requiring pressors.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumothorax, pancytopenia, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation, and confusion. The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The peak inspiratory pressure is 24 cmH2O, plateau pressure is 20 cmH2O, and respiratory system resistance is 4 cmH2O/L/s with a compliance of 45 mL/cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, PaO2 of 160 mmHg, and HCO3- of 27 mEq/L. The patient's white blood cell count is low at 0.4 K/uL, hemoglobin is 9.5 g/dL, platelet count is 47 K/uL, and creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on invasive ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and the use of pressors may increase the risk of stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Delirium/confusion: The patient's age, underlying comorbidities, and medication use may contribute to delirium or confusion.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are slightly elevated, which can be concerning and may require monitoring and management.
6. Cancer progression: The patient has small cell lung cancer, which may progress despite treatment.
7. Pleural effusion: The patient has an acute pleural effusion that requires monitoring and management.
8. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed to maintain adequate heart rate control and prevent thromboembolic events.

It is important to closely monitor the patient"

   In summary, this is a 72 y/o male with COPD, CAD s/p angioplasty in
   [**2180**], afib and small cell lung CA who started [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 2007**] [**8-19**] with
   carboplatin/VP-16 in [**State 395**].  He initially presented to SMMC on [**8-23**]
   with hypotension after accidental overdose on diltiazem.  There, a CXR
   showed R lung white out and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for bronch given
   concern for mass compression of the bronchus.  Chest CT at [**Hospital1 19**] showed
   large centrally obstructing mass with right apical pneumothorax, right
   middle and lower lobe opacity, pigtail was placed.  Patient was then
   bronched on [**8-24**] with purulent drainage, stent was placed and started
   on Vanco/Zosyn for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia.  Patient
   continued to be intubated after the bronch and developed hypotension
   requiring pressors.  Patient also noted to be neutropenic thought
   likely [**1-7**] [**Month/Day (2) 2007**] and sepsis and patient with afib with RVR on a dilt
   gtt.  Patient self-extubated on [**8-26**] and was subsequently re-intubated
   for hypoxia and respiratory distress.  A repeat bronch was performed to
   open collapse. This morning before transfer he was mapped for XRT and
   received his first dose of radiation.

ferred to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**8-24**] for bronch and
   stent placement then noted to have PNX requiring chest tube placement,
   transferred today from SICU for XRT with continued hypoxic respiratory
   failure and hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for his procedure and
   not able to be weaned.  Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive
   PNA, PNX, and underlying lung disease (COPD).  Patient self-extubated 2
   nights ago, required re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to
   pressure control in SICU, but due to sedation today for XRT, patient
   back on AC and not spontaneously breathing.   On AC with TV 450, PEEP
   10, Rate of 18, fi02 of 50%.  Peak pressure 24, Plat 20. Resistance 4
   and compliance of 45.  ABG on these settings are 7.46 39 160.  CXR
   looks like improvement in collapse of LLL from yesterday, may be due to
   bronch.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and not able to be weaned off the ventilator. This is likely due to underlying lung disease (COPD), post-obstructive pneumonia, and pneumothorax. The patient also self-extubated twice before, requiring re-intubation for hypoxia and work of breathing.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is most likely due to a combination of sepsis and diltiazem overdose. The patient was on diltiazem for atrial fibrillation and propofol sedation.

3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pneumothorax, which was noted on admission. It is not clear if the line is related to OSH or lung disease. The chest tube placement has been continued, and daily chest X-rays will be monitored for any changes.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has developed pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all types of blood cells. This may be due to sepsis and chemotherapy treatment. Transfusions of platelets and red blood cells may be required for bleeding or low counts.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which are trending down. This may be due to shock and known liver metast"

   carboplatin/VP-16 in [**State 395**].  He initially presented to SMMC on [**8-23**]
   with hypotension after accidental overdose on diltiazem.  There, a CXR
   showed R lung white out and was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for bronch given
   concern for mass compression of the bronchus.  Chest CT at [**Hospital1 19**] showed
   large centrally obstructing mass with right apical pneumothorax, right
   middle and lower lobe opacity, pigtail was placed.  Patient was then
   bronched on [**8-24**] with purulent drainage, stent was placed and started
   on Vanco/Zosyn for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia.  Patient
   continued to be intubated after the bronch and developed hypotension
   requiring pressors.  Patient also noted to be neutropenic thought
   likely [**1-7**] [**Month/Day (2) 2007**] and sepsis and patient with afib with RVR on a dilt

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and small cell lung cancer who presented to the hospital with hypotension after an accidental overdose on diltiazem. He has been diagnosed with post-obstructive pneumonia and a right apical pneumothorax. The patient underwent bronchoscopic intervention with stent placement, but continued to experience hypotension and respiratory failure. He was intubated and received chest tube placement for pleural effusion. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease (COPD) and post-obstructive pneumonia may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.

2. Delirium/confusion: Due to the patient's age, underlying medical conditions, and prolonged sedation, there is a risk of developing delirium or confusion. Frequent reorientation and appropriate pain management should be implemented.

3. Hypotension: Despite receiving vasopressor support, the patient continues to experience hypotension. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is necessary. Adjustments in vasopressor dosage may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Cancer progression: The patient has small cell lung cancer, which is known for its aggressive nature. Regular monitoring of tumor markers and imaging studies"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with small cell lung cancer who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, pneumonia, and a pneumothorax. He is on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with sepsis. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hyperkalemia, and delirium/confusion. He is receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam) and has undergone several interventions, including bronchoscopy, invasive ventilation, and chest tube placement. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. Imaging reveals a right upper lobe opacity with infiltrate and small pleural effusion. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, pneumonia, pneumothorax, hyperkalemia, and potential cancer-related complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation indicates respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause is not addressed promptly.
2. Pneumonia - The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a bacterial infection in the lungs. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this could lead to worsening respiratory failure and potentially systemic spread of infection.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), currently admitted to the ICU. He underwent radiation therapy today and has been experiencing delirium/confusion, hypotension (not in shock), hyperkalemia (high potassium), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and acute pleural effusion. The patient is on multiple medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, famotidine, and others. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3°C, heart rate 87 bpm, blood pressure 98/53 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 94%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 240, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36. The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), low platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), and elevated lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes show elevated potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++), and decreased calcium (Ca++) and phosphate (PO4) levels. The patient's chest X-ray from August 27th shows bilateral infiltrates, and his recent ABG reveals respiratory acidosis."

   1. Innumerable liver metastases.
   2. No intra- or extrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
   3. Gallbladder wall not convincingly thickened, no cholelithiasis, a
   small
   amount of pericholecystic fluid. If acalculous cholecystitis is a
   consideration, consider a nuclear medicine hepatobiliary study.
   4. Patent main portal vein.
   CXR [**8-28**]:
   As compared to the previous examination, the right-sided chest tube
   is in unchanged position. Also unchanged is the extent of the lateral
   thoracic and cervical air accumulation in the soft tissues. A 1-cm
   right
   apical pneumothorax is seen on the current examination. The lung
   volumes are
   larger than on the previous image. The extent of the right basal
   opacity that
   pre-existed is overall unchanged. The pre-existing left basal opacity
   has
   decreased in extent. Also decreased is the size of the cardiac
   silhouette.
   Good visibility of a right main bronchus stent.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD initially presented to OSH on
   [**8-23**] with hypotension [**1-7**] diltiazem overdose, noted to have
   post-obstructive PNA t
ferred to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**8-24**] for bronch and stent
   placement then noted to have PNX requiring chest tube placement,
   transferred today from SICU for XRT with continued hypoxic respiratory
   failure and hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for his procedure and
   not able to be weaned.  Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive
   PNA, PNX, and underlying lung disease (COPD).  Patient self-extubated 2
   nights ago, required re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to
   pressure control in SICU, but due to sedation today for XRT, patient
   back on AC and not spontaneously breathing.   On AC with TV 450, PEEP
   10, Rate of 18, fi02 of 50%.  Peak pressure 24, Plat 20. Resistance 4
   and compliance of 45.  ABG on these settings are 7.46 39 160.  CXR
   looks like improvement in collapse of LLL from yesterday, may be due to
   bronch.
   -continue Vanco/Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1)
   -wean fi02, when patient
s sedation wears off, consider PS. Follow
   clinically and ABGs.
   -patient may require more bronchoscopy as he continues to be at risk
   for lung collapse.
   -XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
   -continue nebs with mucomyst
   -d/c fluticasone given infection
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax
   -XRT for CA
   -BNP
   .
   #Hypotension: Most likely due to combination of sepsis, dilt gtt
   patient was on for afib and propofol.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.
   -repeat blood cultures
   -U/A with urine culture
   -f/u sputum cultures
   -change propofol to fent/midaz
   -wean pressors to maintain MAP >65
   -bolus fluids as needed
   .
   #Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, ? if line related from OSH or
   related to lung disease.  Stable on CXR, mild air leak noted.
   -continue chest tube, will likely need to stay in throughout intubation
   -daily CXR
   -monitor air leak, if changes dramatically assess for increased size of
   pneumo
   .
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**1-7**] chemo and sepsis. Patient has not been hyper
   or hypothermic. Patient expected to nadir 1 week post-chemo which is
   now.
   -transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <10
   -transfuse HCT for <21
   -continue neupogen until counts return
   -neutropenic precautions
   -hold heparin SQ and provide pneumoboots
   -daily CBC and ANC
   -if no improvement, must consider medication effect though unlikely
   .
   #Transaminitis: LFTs trending down, likely due to shock on top of known
   liver mets.
   -RUQ U/S
   -trend LFTs
   .
   #Afib: goal HR <100, on dilt and sotolol at home
   -continue sotalol [**Hospital1 7**] and dilt 60 QID
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD. He presented to the hospital on [**8-23**] with hypotension due to a diltiazem overdose. He was initially treated for post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) and then transferred to another hospital for bronchoscopic and stent placement. Upon admission to the current ICU, he was noted to have a pneumothorax (PNX) and was placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient underwent radiation therapy (XRT) for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and continued to experience hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. He self-extubated twice but required re-intubation for hypoxia and work of breathing. His current ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 450 mL, PEEP of 10, rate of 18 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 50%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including pancytopenia, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation, and a pneumothorax. His blood cultures, urine analysis, and sputum cultures have been ordered. He is receiving antibiotics for suspected post-obstructive pneumonia and is being closely monitored for lung collapse and pneum"

   small
   amount of pericholecystic fluid. If acalculous cholecystitis is a
   consideration, consider a nuclear medicine hepatobiliary study.
   4. Patent main portal vein.
   CXR [**8-28**]:
   As compared to the previous examination, the right-sided chest tube
   is in unchanged position. Also unchanged is the extent of the lateral
   thoracic and cervical air accumulation in the soft tissues. A 1-cm
   right
   apical pneumothorax is seen on the current examination. The lung
   volumes are
   larger than on the previous image. The extent of the right basal
   opacity that
   pre-existed is overall unchanged. The pre-existing left basal opacity
   has
   decreased in extent. Also decreased is the size of the cardiac
   silhouette.
   Good visibility of a right main bronchus stent.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD initially presented to OSH on
   [**8-23**] with hypotension [**1-7**] diltiazem overdose, noted to have
   post-obstructive PNA t
ferred to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**8-24**] for bronch and stent
   placement then noted to have PNX requiring chest tube placement,
   transferred today from SICU for XRT with continued hypoxic respiratory
   failure and hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for his procedure and
   not able to be weaned.  Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive
   PNA, PNX, and underlying lung disease (COPD).  Patient self-extubated 2
   nights ago, required re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to
   pressure control in SICU, but due to sedation today for XRT, patient
   back on AC and not spontaneously breathing.   On AC with TV 450, PEEP
   10, Rate of 18, fi02 of 50%.  Peak pressure 24, Plat 20. Resistance 4
   and compliance of 45.  ABG on these settings are 7.46 39 160.  CXR
   looks like improvement in collapse of LLL from yesterday, may be due to
   bronch.
   -continue Vanco/Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1)
   -wean fi02, when patient
s sedation wears off, consider PS. Follow
   clinically and ABGs.
   -patient may require more bronchoscopy as he continues to be at risk
   for lung collapse.
   -XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
   -continue nebs with mucomyst
   -d/c fluticasone given infection
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax
   -XRT for CA
   -BNP
   .
   #Hypotension: Most likely due to combination of sepsis, dilt gtt
   patient was on for afib and propofol.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.
   -repeat blood cultures
   -U/A with urine culture
   -f/u sputum cultures
   -change propofol to fent/midaz
   -wean pressors to maintain MAP >65
   -bolus fluids as needed
   .
   #Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, ? if line related from OSH or
   related to lung disease.  Stable on CXR, mild air leak noted.
   -continue chest tube, will likely need to stay in throughout intubation
   -daily CXR
   -monitor air leak, if changes dramatically assess for increased size of
   pneumo
   .
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**1-7**] chemo and sepsis. Patient has not been hyper
   or hypothermic. Patient expected to nadir 1 week post-chemo which is
   now.
   -transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <10
   -transfuse HCT for <21
   -continue neupogen until counts return
   -neutropenic precautions
   -hold heparin SQ and provide pneumoboots
   -daily CBC and ANC
   -if no improvement, must consider medication effect though unlikely
   .
   #Transaminitis: LFTs trending down, likely due to shock on top of known
   liver mets.
   -RUQ U/S
   -trend LFTs
   .
   #Afib: goal HR <100, on dilt and sotolol at home
   -continue sotalol [**Hospital1 7**] and dilt 60 QID
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .
   #Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc, would be due for next round of
   chemo next week, but pending return of his counts.  Had head CT with
   and without and no mets.  Per oncologist, patient has reasonable
   expectation for extending life by several months if he is able to get

   volumes are
   larger than on the previous image. The extent of the right basal
   opacity that
   pre-existed is overall unchanged. The pre-existing left basal opacity
   has
   decreased in extent. Also decreased is the size of the cardiac
   silhouette.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD, who initially presented to OSH with hypotension due to a diltiazem overdose. He was then transferred to Hospital1 for bronchoscopic intervention and stent placement, and subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia and pneumothorax. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and is hypoxic. He also has hypotension requiring pressors. The patient has a known diagnosis of small cell lung cancer and is scheduled for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation and requires close monitoring. Weaning of FiO2 and consideration of pressure support may be necessary when sedation wears off. Daily ABGs and CXR should be performed to assess lung condition and potential collapse.

2. Hypotension: This is likely due to a combination of sepsis and the diltiazem overdose. Repeat blood cultures, urine analysis with culture, and follow-up sputum cultures should be done. Propofol should be replaced with fentanyl and midazolam. Pressors should be weaned to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pre-existing pneumothorax that is currently stable but may require ongoing chest tube placement. Daily CXR should be performed to monitor for any changes in size or air"

   4. Patent main portal vein.
   CXR [**8-28**]:
   As compared to the previous examination, the right-sided chest tube
   is in unchanged position. Also unchanged is the extent of the lateral
   thoracic and cervical air accumulation in the soft tissues. A 1-cm
   right
   apical pneumothorax is seen on the current examination. The lung
   volumes are
   larger than on the previous image. The extent of the right basal
   opacity that
   pre-existed is overall unchanged. The pre-existing left basal opacity
   has
   decreased in extent. Also decreased is the size of the cardiac
   silhouette.
   Good visibility of a right main bronchus stent.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD initially presented to OSH on
   [**8-23**] with hypotension [**1-7**] diltiazem overdose, noted to have
   post-obstructive PNA t
ferred to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**8-24**] for bronch and stent
   placement then noted to have PNX requiring chest tube placement,
   transferred today from SICU for XRT with continued hypoxic respiratory
   failure and hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt remains on mechanical ventilation, on
   AC with TV 450, PEEP 10, Rate of 18, fi02 of 50% currently, doing well
   on these settings.
   - abnormal breathing pattern may represent an acute change in lungs
   such as diaphragmatic irritaion from chest tube, change in PNX,
   displacement of ETT, cough or gag reflex, etc.
   -continue Vanco/Zosyn (d6) for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1)
   - Vanc level today is 17 so continue dosing
   -broaden coverage with Flagyl to include anaerobe coverage
   -wean fi02, when patient
s sedation wears off, consider PS. Follow
   clinically and ABGs.
   -patient may require more bronchoscopy as he continues to be at risk
   for lung collapse.
   -XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
   -continue nebs with mucomyst
   -d/c fluticasone given infection
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax, will continue chest tube during
   mechanical ventilation as at incr risk for alveolar rupture
   -continue XRT for CA
   -BNP elev but not high enough to indicate acute CHF
   .
   #Hypotension: Most likely due to combination of sepsis, dilt gtt
   patient was on for afib and propofol.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.
   -f/u pending cultures
   -changed propofol to fent/midaz
   -wean pressors to maintain MAP >65
   -bolus fluids as needed (monitor CVP)
   .
   #Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, ? if line related from OSH or
   related to lung disease.  Stable on CXR, mild air leak noted.
   -continue chest tube, will likely need to stay in throughout intubation
   -daily CXR
   -monitor air leak, if changes dramatically assess for increased size of
   pneumo
   .
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**1-7**] chemo and sepsis. Patient has not been hyper
   or hypothermic. Patient expected to nadir 1 week post-chemo which is
   now.
   -transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <10
   - today
s plts are 11, will go ahead and trnasfuse with 1U plts
   -transfuse HCT for <21 (will follow XRT recs)
   -continue neupogen until counts return
   -neutropenic precautions
   -hold heparin SQ and provide pneumoboots
   -daily CBC and ANC
   -if no improvement, must consider medication effect though unlikely
   .
   #Transaminitis: LFTs trending down, likely due to shock on top of known
   liver mets.
   -RUQ U/S shows innumerable mets to liver
   -trend LFTs
   .
   #Afib: goal HR <100, on dilt and sotolol at home
   -continue sotalol [**Hospital1 7**] and dilt 60 QID
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .
   #Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc, would be due for next round of
   chemo next week, but pending return of his counts.  Had head CT with
   and without and no mets.  Per oncologist, patient has reasonable
   expectation for extending life by several months if he is able to get
   chemo (early in treatment course) but approximately 2% chance of cure.
   -f/u ONC recs
   -continue XRT and f/u rad onc recs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with COPD and CAD who initially presented to the hospital with hypotension due to diltiazem overdose. He was later found to have post-obstructive pneumonia, a pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and lung cancer. He underwent bronchoscopic intervention and stent placement for the pneumonia and received chest tube insertion for the pneumothorax. The patient was then transferred from the SICU for radiation therapy while continuing with hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension requiring pressors.

Current Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with a TV of 450, PEEP of 10, rate of 18, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient is doing well on these settings. It is important to monitor the patient closely and perform daily chest X-rays to assess any changes in lung condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis and the diltiazem overdose. The pressors should be weaned to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Fluid boluses should be administered as needed, and the patient's response to antibiotic therapy should be monitored.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a known pneumothorax that is stable on chest X-ray. The chest tube will likely need to be continued throughout intubation,"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo male with small cell lung cancer complicated by post obstructive
   pneumonia now with XRT started yesterday.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will continue with A/C support
   -Wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -Extubation limited by pneumonia and secretions and need to safely
   deliver XRT
   2)Pneumonia-Multilobar pneumonia, currently on broad spectrum
   antibiotics
   -Will continue with Vanco/Zosyn
   3)Pneumothorax-
   -Continue chest tube to suction
   -Will repeat CXR this morning
   -Will follow to resolution
   4)Hypotension-This likely represents persistence of sepsis from
   pulmonary source
   -Levophed as needed
will look to wean as possible
   -Will keep CVP towards [**9-16**] depending on pressor requirement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with small cell lung cancer who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and other complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient has a history of small cell lung cancer and is currently undergoing radiation therapy (XRT).
- He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with assisted/controlled mode and supplemental oxygen.
- He has a chest tube inserted for a pneumothorax.
- The patient's vital signs show hypotension, and he has a heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation (AF).
- His lab results indicate hyperkalemia, elevated white blood cell count, and other abnormalities.
- The patient has delirium/confusion, hypotension (not in shock), malignancy (lung cancer), hyperkalemia, and pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation or if the underlying pneumonia does not improve.
2. Pneumonia: The multilobar pneumonia can lead to further deterioration if the antibiotic treatment is ineffective or if the patient develops antibiotic resistance.
3. Pneumothorax: The presence of a chest tube indicates a pneumothorax. If the pneumothorax recurs or if the chest tube becomes blocked"

   CXR: stable right lung field, worsening opacities of left lower lobe
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Patient intubated for his bronchoscopy and not able to be weaned.
   Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PNX, and underlying
   lung disease (COPD).  Patient self-extubated 2 nights ago, required
   re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to pressure control in
   SICU, but due to sedation today for XRT, patient back on AC and not
   spontaneously breathing.   Remains on AC.
   -continue Vanco/Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1).  Continue
   flagyl.
   -wean fi02, consider PS. Will need to wean sedation as mental status is
   primary barrier to extubation. Follow clinically and ABGs.
   -patient may require more bronchoscopy as he continues to be at risk
   for lung collapse.
   -XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
   -continue nebs with mucomyst
   -d/c fluticasone given infection
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax which is resolving, given
   positive pressure support
   -XRT for CA
   .
   #Hypotension: Most likely due to combination of sepsis, dilt gtt
   patient was on for afib and propofol.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.
   -f/u pending cultures
   -changed propofol to fent/midaz
   -continued on levophed, and plan to wean pressors to maintain MAP >65
   -bolus fluids as needed (monitor CVP)
   .
   #Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, improvement on today;s CXR, no air
   leak noted.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued
   -daily CXR
   -monitor air leak, if changes dramatically assess for increased size of
   pneumo
   .
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**1-7**] chemo and sepsis. Patient has not been hyper
   or hypothermic. Patient expected to nadir 1 week post-chemo which is
   now.
   -transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <10.  Goal is above 20
   - today
s plts are 33, obtain evening cbc
   -transfuse HCT for <21 (will follow XRT recs) -> today
s hct 25.7.
   Obtain PM hct.
   -continue neupogen until counts return
   -neutropenic precautions
   -hold heparin SQ and provide pneumoboots
   -daily CBC and ANC
   -if no improvement, must consider medication effect though unlikely
   .
   #Transaminitis: LFTs trending down, likely due to shock on top of known
   liver mets.
   -RUQ U/S shows innumerable mets to liver
   -trend LFTs
   .
   #Afib: goal HR <100, on dilt and sotolol at home
   -continue sotalol [**Hospital1 7**] and dilt 30 QID
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .
   #Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc, would be due for next round of
   chemo next week, but pending return of his counts.  Had head CT with
   and without and no mets.  Per oncologist, patient has reasonable
   expectation for extending life by several months if he is able to get
   chemo (early in treatment course) but approximately 2% chance of cure.
   -f/u ONC recs
   -continue XRT and f/u rad onc recs

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia and previously underwent bronchoscopic and stent placement. He also had a pneumothorax that required chest tube placement. The patient is currently intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and has been self-extubated twice. He requires pressors for hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, and has pancytopenia likely caused by chemotherapy and sepsis.

The patient's current medications include Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole, Fentanyl, Midazolam, Norepinephrine, Famotidine, and Sotalol. He is also receiving nebulizers with Mucomyst and has a chest tube for pneumothorax.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.7 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 30. His hemoglobin level is 8.9 g/dL and his creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes and abnormal electrolyte levels.

   CXR [**8-28**]:
   As compared to the previous examination, the right-sided chest tube
   is in unchanged position. Also unchanged is the extent of the lateral
   thoracic and cervical air accumulation in the soft tissues. A 1-cm
   right
   apical pneumothorax is seen on the current examination. The lung
   volumes are
   larger than on the previous image. The extent of the right basal
   opacity that
   pre-existed is overall unchanged. The pre-existing left basal opacity
   has
   decreased in extent. Also decreased is the size of the cardiac
   silhouette.
   Good visibility of a right main bronchus stent.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD initially presented to OSH on
   [**8-23**] with hypotension [**1-7**] diltiazem overdose, noted to have
   post-obstructive PNA t
ferred to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**8-24**] for bronch and stent
   placement then noted to have PNX requiring chest tube placement,
   transferred today from SICU for XRT with continued hypoxic respiratory
   failure and hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Patient intubated for his procedure and not able to be weaned.  Likely
   multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PNX, and underlying lung
   disease (COPD).  Patient self-extubated 2 nights ago, required
   re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to pressure control in
   SICU, but due to sedation today for XRT, patient back on AC and not
   spontaneously breathing.   On AC with TV 450, PEEP 10, Rate of 18, fi02
   of 50%.  Peak pressure 24, Plat 20. Resistance 4 and compliance of 45.
   ABG on these settings are 7.46 39 160.  CXR looks like improvement in
   collapse of LLL from yesterday, may be due to bronch.

   such as diaphragmatic irritaion from chest tube, change in PNX,
   displacement of ETT, cough or gag reflex, etc.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with COPD and CAD who presented to the hospital with hypotension, post-obstructive pneumonia, pneumothorax, and small cell lung cancer. He was initially intubated for his procedure and not able to be weaned. The patient self-extubated two nights ago and required re-intubation for hypoxia and work of breathing. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a TV of 450, PEEP of 10, rate of 18, and FiO2 of 50%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 39, and PaO2 of 160. The patient's chest x-ray shows improvement in the collapse of the left lower lobe from yesterday, possibly due to bronchoscopic intervention. The patient remains at risk for lung collapse and may require more bronchoscopies. He is also undergoing radiation therapy for his cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has underlying lung disease (COPD) and post-obstructive pneumonia, which contribute to his hypoxic respiratory failure. Monitoring and adjusting ventilator settings will be important in managing this condition.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a pneumothorax, which requires the continuation of chest tube placement. There is a risk of alveolar rupture during mechanical ventilation, so close monitoring with daily chest x-rays is"

   72 yo male with small cell lung cancer (metastatic) now with post
   obstructive pneumonia and now undergoing XRT for aid in palliation of
   obstructing lesion.  This is in the setting of neurtopenia through to
   today in the setting of chemotherapy.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Well tolerated support with XRT continuing and
   pneumonia under Rx
   -will move to PSV today
   -Have capacity to wean ventilator today
   -PTX has been well controlled
   -Will move to decrease sedation as mental status may well be primary
   barrier to extubation
   -Continue with XRT and pneumonia treatment today
   -Continue with nebs and mucormyst and chest tube
   2)Pneumonia-
   -ZOsyn/Vanco/Flagyl
   -Mucomyst nebs
   3)Lung Cancer-
   -continue XRT
   -Will continue to treat patient as neutropneia at this time

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (metastatic) who is now experiencing post obstructive pneumonia and is undergoing radiation therapy for palliation of the obstructing lesion. The patient's respiratory failure is well-tolerated with ongoing XRT and pneumonia treatment. He has neutropenia due to chemotherapy. The patient's pneumonia is being treated with Zosyn, Vancomycin, and Flagyl, while Mucomyst nebs are being used for lung clearance. The patient's lung cancer is being treated with continued XRT. Sepsis is being managed by weaning off norepinephrine as tolerated. The patient's other conditions include delirium/confusion, hypotension (not in shock), malignancy (lung cancer), hyperkalemia (high potassium), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and acute pleural effusion. ICU care includes tube feeds for nutrition, arterial line for monitoring, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Patient intubated for his bronchoscopy and not able to be weaned.
   Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PNX, and underlying
   lung disease (COPD).  Patient self-extubated 2 nights ago, required
   re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to pressure control in
   SICU, but due to sedation today for XRT, patient back on AC and not
   spontaneously breathing.   Remains on AC.
   -continue Vanco/Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1).  Continue
   flagyl.
   -wean PEEP today
   -patient may require more bronchoscopy as he continues to be at risk
   for lung collapse.
   -XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
   -continue nebs with mucomyst
   -d/c fluticasone given infection
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax which is resolving, given
   positive pressure support
   -XRT for CA
   .
   #Hypotension: Most likely due to combination of sepsis, dilt gtt
   patient was on for afib and propofol.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.
   -f/u pending cultures
   -changed propofol to fent/midaz
   -continued on levophed, and plan to wean pressors to maintain MAP >65
   -bolus fluids as needed (monitor CVP)
   .
   #Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, improvement on today;s CXR, no air
   leak noted.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued
   -daily CXR
   -monitor air leak, if changes dramatically assess for increased size of

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD, who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), pneumothorax (PTX), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). He underwent bronchoscopy and stent placement for his PNA, but developed hypotension requiring pressors and respiratory failure necessitating intubation. The patient's condition has been complicated by pancytopenia, pneumothorax, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation, and sinusitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, medications, or a combination of both. It is important to monitor his blood pressure closely and wean off the pressors while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a resolving pneumothorax that requires continued chest tube placement and positive pressure ventilation. Monitoring for any changes in size or air leak is essential.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may be a result of chemotherapy and sepsis. Close monitoring of blood counts is necessary, and transfusion of platelets and packed red blood cells may be required to maintain target levels.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, likely due to liver metastases and shock. Trending LFTs is important"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Patient intubated for his bronchoscopy and not able to be weaned.
   Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PNX, and underlying
   lung disease (COPD).  Patient self-extubated 2 nights ago, required
   re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to pressure control in
   SICU, but due to sedation today for XRT, patient back on AC and not
   spontaneously breathing.   Remains on AC.
   -continue Vanco/Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1).  Continue
   flagyl.
   -wean fi02, consider PS. Will need to wean sedation as mental status is
   primary barrier to extubation. Follow clinically and ABGs.
   -patient may require more bronchoscopy as he continues to be at risk
   for lung collapse.
   -XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
   -continue nebs with mucomyst
   -d/c fluticasone given infection
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax which is resolving, given
   positive pressure support
   -XRT for CA

   -changed propofol to fent/midaz
   -continued on levophed, and plan to wean pressors to maintain MAP >65
   -bolus fluids as needed (monitor CVP)
   .
   #Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, improvement on today;s CXR, no air
   leak noted.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued
   -daily CXR
   -monitor air leak, if changes dramatically assess for increased size of

The patient has been intubated for bronchoscopy and has not been able to wean off the ventilator. He self-extubated two nights ago but required re-intubation for hypoxia and work of breathing. The patient's sedation was increased for radiation therapy, and he is now back on assisted ventilation.

The patient is receiving antibiotics for the post-obstructive PNA and is also on Flagyl. The plan is to wean FiO2 and consider pressure support. The patient's mental status is a barrier to extubation, so sedation will be weaned as appropriate. Daily ABGs will be followed.

The patient may require more bronchoscopies as he continues to be at risk for lung collapse. Daily chest X-rays will be monitored to assess for any changes in lung edema due to radiation therapy. Nebulizers with Mucomyst will be continued, and fluticasone will be discontinued due to infection. The chest tube will be continued for pneumothorax, which is resolving, while positive pressure support is maintained. Radiation therapy for CA will be continued.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) after bronchoscopy and stent placement. The patient has had a complicated course, requiring chest tube placement for pneumothorax and intubation for respiratory failure. He self-extubated twice but required re-intubation due to hypoxia and work of breathing. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure control mode and supplemental oxygen.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying lung disease (COPD), post-obstructive PNA, and pneumothorax have contributed to his inability to maintain adequate oxygenation. Despite previous weaning attempts, the patient remains on assisted control ventilation due to sedation for radiation therapy.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of sepsis and medication side effects. He was previously on diltiazem and propofol, both of which can lower blood pressure. The patient's fluid status is being monitored, and fluids are being given as needed to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) goal of 14.

3. Pneumothorax: The patient initially had a pneumothorax on admission, which has shown improvement but is still being managed with a chest tube while on positive pressure ventilation. Daily chest X-rays will be performed to monitor"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Patient intubated for his bronchoscopy and not able to be weaned.
   Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PNX, and underlying
   lung disease (COPD).  Patient self-extubated 2 nights ago, required
   re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to pressure control in
   SICU, but due to sedation today for XRT, patient back on AC and not
   spontaneously breathing.   Remains on AC.
   -continue Vanco/Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1).  Continue
   flagyl.
   -wean PEEP today
   -patient may require more bronchoscopy as he continues to be at risk
   for lung collapse.
   -XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
   -continue nebs with mucomyst
   -d/c fluticasone given infection
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax which is resolving, given
   positive pressure support
   -XRT for CA
   .
   #Hypotension: Most likely due to combination of sepsis, dilt gtt
   patient was on for afib and propofol.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.
   -f/u pending cultures
   -changed propofol to fent/midaz
   -continued on levophed, and plan to wean pressors to maintain MAP >65
   -bolus fluids as needed (monitor CVP)
   .
   #Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, improvement on today;s CXR, no air
   leak noted.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued
   -daily CXR
   -monitor air leak, if changes dramatically assess for increased size of
   pneumo
   .
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**1-7**] chemo and sepsis. Patient has not been hyper
   or hypothermic. Patient expected to nadir 1 week post-chemo which is
   now.
   -transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <10.  Goal is above 20 (today
   plts are 22)
   -transfuse HCT for <21 (will follow XRT recs) -> today
s hct 25.7.
   Obtain PM hct.
   -continue neupogen until counts return
   -neutropenic precautions
   -hold heparin SQ and provide pneumoboots
   -daily CBC and ANC
   .
   #Transaminitis: LFTs trending down, likely due to shock on top of known
   liver mets.
   -RUQ U/S shows innumerable mets to liver
   -trend LFTs
   .
   #Afib: goal HR <100, on dilt and sotolol at home
   -continue sotalol [**Hospital1 7**] and dilt 30 QID
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .
   #Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc, would be due for next round of
   chemo next week, but pending return of his counts.  Had head CT with
   and without and no mets.  Per oncologist, patient has reasonable
   expectation for extending life by several months if he is able to get
   chemo (early in treatment course) but approximately 2% chance of cure.
   -f/u ONC recs
   -continue XRT and f/u rad onc recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with COPD, CAD, and small cell lung cancer who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), pneumothorax (PTX), and hypoxic respiratory failure. He underwent bronchoscopy, stent placement, and chest tube insertion. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and work of breathing. He self-extubated two nights ago but required re-intubation. His condition is multifactorial, involving post-obstructive PNA, PTX, and underlying lung disease (COPD). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 91/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is hypotensive and requires pressors.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation has led to the need for mechanical ventilation. This is likely due to post-obstructive PNA, PTX, and underlying COPD.

2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a resolving pneumothorax that requires ongoing chest tube placement and positive pressure support.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to a combination of sepsis and diuretic use. Pressors are being"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (metastatic) and post obstructive pneumonia. He is currently undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) for palliative treatment of the obstructing lesion. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure but is reasonably oxygenated and ventilated on the current settings. The plan is to wean off sedation as tolerated and decrease PEEP to 5. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be considered later in the day depending on the patient's condition.

2. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, and Metronidazole. The cultures will be followed to tailor antibiotic therapy accordingly.

3. Septic and Hypovolemic Shock: The patient requires a pressor (Levophed) and has a low central venous pressure (CVP) of 6, indicating ongoing volume resuscitation.

4. Lung Cancer: The patient is continuing with radiation therapy for his lung cancer.

Other notable findings include atrial fibrillation (AFib), hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), pleural effusion, and delirium/confusion. The patient is critically ill and is currently in the ICU."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (metastatic) and post-obstructive pneumonia. He is currently undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) for the aid in palliation of the obstructing lesion. The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may require increased support or intervention such as tracheostomy.

2. Sepsis and Hypovolemic Shock: The patient has been treated with antibiotics and fluids to manage an infection and maintain adequate blood pressure. There is a risk of recurrent sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation leading to shock.

3. Lung Cancer: The patient has metastatic small cell lung cancer. The progression of the cancer can lead to further respiratory compromise and other systemic complications.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is being rate-controlled with medications. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias and associated complications.

5. Pleural Effusion, Acute: The patient has an acute pleural effusion, which may require drainage and further evaluation.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and prompt management of any potential complications that may arise."

   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PTX, and underlying
   lung disease (COPD).  Patient had previously self-extubated, required
   re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to pressure control in
   SICU, but due to sedation yesterday for XRT, patient back on AC and not
   spontaneously breathing.   Remains on AC.  Had another bronch yesterday
   showing nothing significant.
   -worsened CXR may indicate worsening PNA, collapse of lung from
   post-obstructive PNA or volume overload from aggressive fluid boluses
   yesterday
   - Prepare patient for extubation tomorrow after final XRT (5 out of 5
   tomorrow morning)
   - Decrease volume with lasix -- Diurese w goal -1L for today

He is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and has not been able to be weaned. The patient's condition has worsened, with worsening chest X-ray indicating potential worsening pneumonia, collapse of the lung from post-obstructive pneumonia or volume overload from aggressive fluid boluses yesterday. 

The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of sepsis, diuretics, and propofol. He was on diltiazem for atrial fibrillation and propofol sedation. The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to chemotherapy and sepsis. His transaminitis is likely due to shock on top of known liver metastases. 

The patient has small cell lung cancer and is scheduled for chemotherapy next week, pending the return of his counts. He had a head CT scan without evidence of metastasis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pneumonia, respiratory failure, hypotension, pancytopenia, transaminitis, and atrial fibrillation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD, who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia and pneumothorax. He underwent bronchoscopy and stent placement, and required re-intubation for hypoxia and work of breathing. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, pancytopenia, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation, and small cell lung cancer. He is receiving mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, diuretics, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening pneumonia: The patient's worsening CXR may indicate worsening pneumonia, which could lead to further respiratory failure and the need for additional interventions.
2. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive total input-output, indicating a potential volume overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
3. Bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, especially with platelet counts below 20,000/mm3. Transfusion of platelets may be necessary for bleeding prevention or control.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's transaminitis could progress to hepatic failure, leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events, and anticoagulation should be considered once his platelet count improves.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of COPD and CAD. He presented with post-obstructive pneumonia and underwent bronchoscopy and stent placement. The patient developed a pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and is now experiencing hypotension requiring pressors. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, pancytopenia, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation, and small cell lung cancer. He is intubated and on assisted ventilation due to the hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is also receiving antibiotics for post-obstructive pneumonia, chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer, and radiation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pneumonia with bilateral pleural effusions and interstitial edema on chest X-ray. There is a possibility of recurrent pneumothorax due to underlying lung disease and positive pressure ventilation. The patient's pancytopenia may lead to bleeding or infection. Transaminitis could progress to liver failure. Atrial fibrillation may result in thromboembolic events if anticoagulation is not administered. Small cell lung cancer may progress despite chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory values. Frequent reassessment of the chest X-ray is necessary to monitor for worsening pneumonia, pneumothorax, and radiation-induced lung injury. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PTX, and underlying
   lung disease (COPD).  Patient had previously self-extubated, required
   re-intubation for hypoxia and WOB.  Was weaned to pressure control in
   SICU, but due to sedation yesterday for XRT, patient back on AC and not
   spontaneously breathing.   Remains on AC.  Had another bronch yesterday
   showing nothing significant.
   -worsened CXR may indicate worsening PNA, collapse of lung from
   post-obstructive PNA or volume overload from aggressive fluid boluses
   yesterday
   - Prepare patient for extubation tomorrow after final XRT (5 out of 5
   tomorrow morning)
   - Decrease volume with lasix -- Diurese w goal -1L for today

   ask if they may want to do another Bronch beforehand

   ([**8-24**]=day1).  Continue flagyl as well.
   - PEEP incr to 10 yesterday and incr FiO2 as well for better
   oxygenation
may be due to increased volume status

   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax which has resolved, given
   positive pressure support

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), pneumothorax, and hypoxia. He underwent bronchoscopy and stent placement, but his condition worsened, leading to the need for reintubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP and FiO2 due to hypoxic respiratory failure. He also has pancytopenia likely caused by chemotherapy and sepsis, transaminitis, atrial fibrillation, and small cell lung cancer. The patient's recent CXR shows worsening pneumonia and lung collapse, possibly due to post-obstructive PNA or volume overload. The plan is to prepare the patient for extubation tomorrow after final radiation therapy (XRT) and to continue with Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Metronidazole for the post-obstructive PNA. The patient's medical team will closely monitor his condition and make necessary adjustments to his treatment plan. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypoxia, further respiratory failure, infection, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular issues."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and presents with pneumonia, delirium/confusion, hypotension (not in shock), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hyperkalemia (high potassium), pleural effusion (acute), and lung cancer.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and may require antibiotics for treatment.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or organ dysfunction. It is important to assess and manage the underlying cause to improve the patient's mental status.
3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to several factors, including sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication side effects. Monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is in atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm. This condition increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. Anticoagulation therapy may be required to prevent these complications.
5. Hyperkalemia (high potassium): The patient has"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), subsequent pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions including bronchoscopic and stent placement, X-ray therapy (XRT), antibiotics, diuretics, and blood product transfusions.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and has shown improvement in oxygenation but with worsening chest X-ray indicating possible worsening PNA, lung collapse, or volume overload.
- Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient's heart rhythm has been in atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may be secondary to agitation or decreased sedation. The goal is to control ventricular rate below 100 beats per minute.
- Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, likely due to sepsis, diltiazem, and other factors. Pressors have been required intermittently.
- Pneumothorax: The patient had a resolved pneumothorax with ongoing chest tube drainage.
- Pancytopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count, likely due to chemotherapy and sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD, who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), subsequent pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, and now hypotension requiring pressors. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, bronchoscopy, and stent placement. He is also receiving radiation therapy (XRT) for small cell lung cancer. The patient's condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), pancytopenia, transaminitis, and potential sinusitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he required pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. If the hypotension persists or worsens, it may compromise organ perfusion and lead to multiorgan dysfunction.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure. There is a risk of pneumonia worsening or developing new complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke. Close monitoring and anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.
4. Hematological complications: The patient has pancytopenia, which"

   Slight improvement in perihilar and basilar edema. Persistent
   retrocardiac
   atelectasis. Improved right pleural effusion and unchanged
   small-to-moderate
   left effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Had been weaned off pressors two days ago, but now BPs
   ranging lower.  Most likely due to combination of Afib with RVR and
   sedation for ventilation .  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - decrease sedation as tolerated; may need prn antipsychotic if becomes
   agitated
   - pt requiring no pressors this AM, but needed levophed for BP 70s/40s
   when taken down to XRT and moved around
   - Switch levophed to phenylephrine b/c levophed could theoretically
   contribute to tachycardia
   - no further diuresis today; goal of net even.
   .
   #Afib:  RVR started after PS trial yesterday and intermittently
   continues with agitation or moving around.  [**Month (only) 51**] be hemodynamically
   unstable with low blood pressures secondary to RVR; ventricular rate
   steady in upper 90s to 100s in AM.  Episode last night into 140s did
   show possible demand ischemia last evening, which resolved with IV dilt
   push putting RVR into 90s.  RVR may become a chronic problem due to
   metastatic lung processes that may be affecting his heart.  RVR appears
   exacerbated by agitation from intubation with decreased sedation; may
   also be secondary to decreased intravascular volume, though total
   volume up or secondary to infection.  Goal ventricular HR <100, on dilt
   and sotolol at home.
   - start Dilt drip continue sotalol [**Hospital1 7**]
   - consider starting amiodarone if it appears he may need long term
   control
   - if start amiodarone later, remember to monitor for extra
   beta-blocking and QT prolonging effects of amiodarone, in addition to
   the sotalol he is already getting
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PTX, and underlying
   lung disease (COPD). Patient not ready for extubation as shown by
   failed pressure support trial yesterday.  Chest Xray over previous two
   days showed some interval improvement, possibly secondary to lasix.  He
   may be intravascularly volume depleted though total body volume up,
   - Hold on diuresis
   - continue Vanco / Zosyn (day11 today) for post-obstructive PNA
   ([**8-24**]=day1) and Flagyl.
   - PEEP continues at 10 and incr FiO2
 goal to decrease sedation and
   decrease FiO2 slowly
   - XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
 XRT (5 out of 5 today)
   -continue nebs
   - D/C mucomyst
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax which has resolved until
   extubation
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, improvement on CXR, no air leak
   noted.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued, monitor
   air leak
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary chemo and possibly sepsis, but
   resolving.
   - transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <20
   - today
s hct stable at 27.
   - WBC 20.7 increased; pt was recently on neupogen
   - Neuts 63  Bands 25

   chemotherapy.
   - RUQ U/S showed many mets to liver
   - continue to trend LFTs

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD, who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia, subsequent pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient underwent bronchoscopic and stent placement and received chest X-ray therapy. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), pneumothorax (PTX), and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent bronchial stent placement and required re-intubation due to hypoxia and work of breathing. He has been receiving aggressive treatment including antibiotics, diuretics, and chest tube placement for PTX. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and is currently on diltiazem and sotalol.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 70s/40s to 110s systolic, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,483 mL, output of 2,760 mL, and a positive balance of 723 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 461 IU/L, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 67 K/uL.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial hypoxic respiratory failure due to post-obstructive pneumonia, pneumothorax, and underlying COPD. This condition requires close monitoring and management.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AF with RVR): The patient has episodes of AF with RVR, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and increased risk of thromboembolic events. It is essential to control the ventricular rate and maintain adequate heart function.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, possibly due to sepsis, the effects of diltiazem, or other factors. Close monitoring and hemodynamic support are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Pneumothorax: Although the pneumothorax appears to have resolved, the patient still has a chest tube in place. Monitoring for any signs of recurrence or worsening is crucial.

5. Pancytopenia: The patient exhibits signs of pancytopenia, including low white blood cell count, low red blood cell count, and low platelet count. This may be related to chemotherapy and sepsis. Regular monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as blood transfusions, are required.

6. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, likely secondary to chemotherapy. Regular monitoring of"

   night. WBC has been climbing post chemo/neutropenia. CVP down on PEEP;
   CXR still suggests volume overload but CVP down. [**Month (only) 51**] have been diuresed
   faster than he could mobilize interstitial fluid. Still has moderate
   secretions from ETT. Continues on antibiotics. Hold fluids even today.
   Ventlator adjusted to provide bigger VT (when patient on PSV, he was
   taking larger tidal volumes than he had been getting on the AC
   settings). This may help with agitation.
   Hct stable. No evidence of acute bleeding. Not at transfusion
   threshold.
   Afib/flutter remains a problem. Continues on diltiazem and sotalol. Try
   diltiazem infusion for now. Use low dose neo for now if needed for

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, and pneumonia. They are currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable, with intermittent hypotension and tachycardia. They also have a history of lung cancer and have received radiation therapy. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, suggest a possible infection in the lungs. This could be due to their weakened immune system from cancer treatment and the use of a ventilator.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, which can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other cardiac complications. Medications are being administered to manage this condition.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can affect heart function and lead to arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary.

4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's lungs are not adequately oxygenating the blood, requiring mechanical ventilation support. This can be caused by the underlying lung cancer, pneumonia, or complications from the ventilator itself.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating poor perfusion and potential organ damage."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Requiring levophed, did not tolerate phenylephrine.
   Titrating BP to MAP>65.  Appears that may be cardiogenic b/c levophed
   works but phenylephrine does not.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be a combination of
   sedation, beta blocker, and Afib.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - decrease sedation as tolerated; may need prn antipsychotic if becomes
   agitated
   - Switch levophed to phenylephrine b/c levophed could theoretically
   contribute to tachycardia
   - no further diuresis today; goal of net even
   - Hold sotalol, which may help w pressures
   .
   #Afib:  Rate in 80s-90s mostly but bounces around occasionally w
   ventricular rates to 120s.  BPs may be low secondary to Afib.    Has
   history of Afib.   RVR appears exacerbated by agitation from intubation
   with decreased sedation; may also be secondary to decreased
   intravascular volume, though total volume up or secondary to
   infection.  Goal ventricular HR <100, on dilt and sotalol at home.
   - continue Dilt TID, but hold sotalol as above
   - consider starting amiodarone or digoxin if it appears he may need
   long term control
   - if start amiodarone later, remember to monitor for extra
   beta-blocking and QT prolonging effects of amiodarone
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Saturations have decreased since
   yesterday to low 90s, which could be due to worsening of pneumothorax,
   but repeat CXR this morning upright showed no signs of pneumothorax.
   Bronch today showing that pulmonary stent is in right main bronchus
   rather than bronchus intermedius.
   - page IP about whether we need to move stent
   - ask Thoracic Surgery about chest tube suction vs water seal
   - Pressure support trial
   - continue Vanco / Zosyn (day12 today) for post-obstructive PNA
   ([**8-24**]=day1) and Flagyl.
   - XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
 XRT finished yesterday
   -continue nebs
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax which has resolved until
   extubation
   .
   # Acute Renal Insufficiency:
   Creatinine rising slowly, may be prerenal etiology, likely from
   diarrhea.  Potassium elevation related to repletion yesterday
   afternoon.
   - continue to monitor
   - hold off on fluids because CVP 13, and total body fluid up, pt very
   edematous
   # Diarrhea:
   Started having diarrhea [**9-2**] evening.  Appears that it could be
   secondary to Neutra-phos, which is known to cause diarrhea
correlates
   with the time neutraphos was given. C. Diff Negative.  Stool was trace
   Guaiac Positive.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, no signs of PTX on CXR.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued, monitor
   air leak
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary chemo and possibly sepsis, but
   resolving.   No longer neutropenic. today
s hct stable at 29. WBC
   stable at 20, iikely related to neupogen he was previously on.
   - transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <20
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST/ALT trending down, Alk Phos/LDH stable.  likely
   elevated LFTs secondary to chemotherapy.  RUQ U/S showed many mets to
   liver.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc.  Has very little chance of cure
   though chemo may prolong his life for a few months. Final chest XRT was
   today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia and subsequent bronchial stent placement. The patient has had an evolving course of resolving pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, hypotension requiring pressors, atrial fibrillation, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal insufficiency, diarrhea, pancytopenia, transaminitis, and small cell lung cancer. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires pressors. The cause of hypotension appears to be cardiogenic, as levophed is effective but phenylephrine is not. There is a possibility of exacerbation of right ventricular failure (RVR) due to decreased intravascular volume or infection.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is now exacerbated by agitation from intubation and decreased sedation. Ventricular rates are in the 120s, and the patient's blood pressure may be low secondary to atrial fibrillation. Goal ventricular heart rate <100.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels have decreased to low 90s, possibly due to worsening pneumothorax or pulmonary stent placement in the right main bronchus instead of bronch"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Had been weaned off pressors two days ago, but now BPs
   ranging lower.  Most likely due to combination of Afib with RVR and
   sedation for ventilation .  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - decrease sedation as tolerated; may need prn antipsychotic if becomes
   agitated
   - pt requiring no pressors this AM, but needed levophed for BP 70s/40s
   when taken down to XRT and moved around
   - Switch levophed to phenylephrine b/c levophed could theoretically
   contribute to tachycardia
   - no further diuresis today; goal of net even.
   .
   #Afib:  Rate in 80s-90s mostly but bounces around occasionally w
   ventricular rates to 120s.  BPs may be low secondary to Afib.    Has
   history of Afib; may be a chronic problem due to metastatic lung
   processes that may be affecting his heart.  RVR appears exacerbated by
   agitation from intubation with decreased sedation; may also be
   secondary to decreased intravascular volume, though total volume up or
   secondary to infection.  Goal ventricular HR <100, on dilt and sotalol
   at home.
   - continue sotalol [**Hospital1 7**] and Dilt TID
   - consider starting amiodarone if it appears he may need long term
   control
   - if start amiodarone later, remember to monitor for extra
   beta-blocking and QT prolonging effects of amiodarone, in addition to
   the sotalol he is already getting
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Likely multifactorial, from post-obstructive PNA, PTX, and underlying
   lung disease (COPD). Patient on increased tidal volumes.  He may be
   intravascularly volume depleted though total body volume up
   - Pressure support trial
   - continue Vanco / Zosyn (day12 today) for post-obstructive PNA
   ([**8-24**]=day1) and Flagyl.
   - XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
 XRT finished yesterday
   -continue nebs
   -continue chest tube for pneumothorax which has resolved until
   extubation
   .
   # Acute Renal Insufficiency:
   Creatinine and potassium continue to rise slowly.
   -
   # Diarrhea:
   Started having diarrhea [**9-2**] evening.
   - f/u C. diff
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, improvement on CXR, no air leak
   noted.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued, monitor
   air leak
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary chemo and possibly sepsis, but
   resolving.   No longer neutropenic. today
s hct stable at 29. WBC
   stable at 20, may be related to neupogen he was previously on.
   - transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <20
   - holding heparin SQ and provide pneumoboots
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST/ALT trending down, Alk Phos/LDH stable.  likely
   elevated LFTs secondary to chemotherapy.  RUQ U/S showed many mets to
   liver.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc.  Has very little chance of cure
   though chemo may prolong his life for a few months. Final chest XRT was
   today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia, status post bronchoscopic and stent placement, and subsequent development of resolving pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. He is currently hypotensive and requires pressors for blood pressure support. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and agitation due to sedation for ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to a combination of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and sedation for ventilation. This requires close monitoring and adjustment of pressor medications.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may be exacerbated by metastatic lung processes. The goal is to maintain ventricular rate below 100 beats per minute and continue current medications (diltiazem and sotalol). Consider starting amiodarone for long-term control, taking into account potential drug interactions and QT prolongation effects.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including post-obstructive pneumonia, pneumothorax, and underlying lung disease (COPD). Increased tidal volumes have been initiated, and a pressure support trial is planned. Cultures are pending, and antibiotics (Vanco and Zosyn) will be continued. Nebulizers and chest tube"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, hypotension, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, lung cancer, anemia, and a pneumothorax. The patient is sedated and intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation with assist control mode. Oxygen saturation levels are down, and the patient's heart rate is somewhat better controlled on oral diltiazem. White blood cell count is stable at 20.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there is concern that sedation may be contributing to this issue. The patient has been started on norepinephrine with some improvement, but hypotension persists.
2. Marginal Oxygenation: The patient continues to have marginal oxygenation with moderate secretions and persistent infiltrate on the left lung. Antibiotics are being administered, but there is concern that the chest tube may not be functioning adequately.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has a history of pneumothorax, and a repeat chest X-ray in the full upright position is pending to reassess for this condition. If no pneumothorax is present, bronchoscopy may be considered to assess for a mucus plug.
4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which may be related to the sedation and critical illness.

   antibiotics.
   Persistent hypotension. Concern about role of sedation. Will try to
   reduce/stop versed today. CVP 12 on PEEP 10 despite postive fluid
   balance. Albumin  is 2 and he continues to third space fluid. Have
   reduced FIO2 to 0.5. If he tolerates this, will try to reduce PEEP.
   Heart rate well controlled on present regimen.
   Hct stable. Not at transfusion threshold.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has not shown significant progress in decreasing supplemental oxygen or weaning vasopressors. An echocardiogram yesterday revealed mildly depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. The patient is unable to provide history as they are sedated. The patient has a history of pneumonia, delirium/confusion, hypotension, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, hyperkalemia, atrial fibrillation, acute pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. There is concern about a shunt through the right lung due to decreased ventilation, and the healthcare team plans to try the patient on the left side to improve oxygenation. Intermittent secretions are being suctioned, and antibiotics will be continued. The patient's persistent hypotension is a concern, and there is a plan to reduce sedation. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 10 despite a positive fluid balance. The patient's albumin level is 2, indicating ongoing third-space fluid loss. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) has been reduced to 0.5, and if tolerated, there will be an attempt to reduce PEEP. The patient's heart rate is well-controlled on the present regimen. Hematoc"

   - goal was to slowly decrease FiO2 and then PEEP, but could not (see
   below)
   - try decreasing sedation, but be aware that he becomes agitated w
   sedation
   - call thoracics to assess chest tube--> didn't hear back
   - day# 13 of intubation, consider trach:
     - contact[**Name (NI) **] oncology about prognosis--> oncology doesn't feel trach
   is a good idea bc prognosis is so poor.  Mean lifespan of pt w
   extensive small cell such as this lives [**4-10**] mo on chemo, but onc team
   does not feel that this pt will likely reach stage where he can get
   chemo again. (would need to be extubated, off pressors, and platelets
   >100)
     - contact social work
     - contact[**Name (NI) **] daughter about possible trach--> she is not official HCP
   (pt does not have a HCP), but she will discuss all options with her
   siblings and come to conclusion
   --> ** FAMILY MTG on Saturday afternoon with siblings who live nearby
   ... who appear to be in favor of Trach at this time
   - day# 13 of antibiotics -- stop Vanco after day#14
   - increased Dilt to 60mg QID (from TID) b/c was increasing HR towards
   end of scheduled time
   - around 19:30, he desatted to 87%, so an ABG was drawn, which showed
   PaO2 of 58, so his FiO2 was turned back up to 60% (from 50%).

   - sats improved w increased FiO2 to 100%, then backed down to 80%
   --> 0300 --> sats low 90s and heart rate increasing to 120s and
   occasional 140s, so RT did an alveolar recruitment (pt did not tolerate
   APRV-- HR rising 150s and BP dropping, so RT stopped APRV after 4 min,

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Saturations have decreased since
   yesterday to low 90s, which could be due to worsening of secretions or
   atelectasis.  Alveolar recruitment seemed to work well.  Daughter
   stated over phone that children and stepchildren of patient would agree
   to tracheostomy.
   - ask Thoracic Surgery about chest tube ?
   - Pressure support trial ?
   - continue Vanco / Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1) and
   Flagyl.  Stop vanc/zosy after 14 day course?; stop after 10/2 dose
   - XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
 XRT finished yesterday
   -continue nebs
   -Place on left side as right lobe does not ventilate; to increase
   oxygenation
   - Family meeting today Saturday with stepchildren discuss trach as
   patient has been intubated for 14 days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD. He presented with post-obstructive pneumonia and had a bronch and stent placement. The patient evolved with resolving pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement and is now experiencing hypotension and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving pressors for blood pressure support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is requiring pressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating possible cardiogenic shock or septic shock. The low blood pressure may be due to a combination of factors such as sedation, beta-blocker use, and atrial fibrillation.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels have decreased, which could be due to worsening secretions, atelectasis, or infection. Alveolar recruitment seems to work well, but further evaluation is needed.
3. Pneumothorax: Although the patient had a resolved pneumothorax on admission, the presence of chest tube placement suggests ongoing air leak or recurrence.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, likely secondary to chemotherapy and possibly sepsis. Monitoring for signs of infection and bleeding is important.
5. Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes may be related to chemotherapy. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is necessary.
6. Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and pneumothorax (PTX). The patient has been in the ICU for 14 days and has been intubated. He requires pressors for hypotension and high levels of FiO2 and PEEP for hypoxia.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxia despite increasing FiO2 and PEEP. This could be due to worsening PNA, pulmonary embolism (PE), effusions, or other factors.
2. Hypotension: The patient is requiring moderate doses of levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. This suggests septic shock or other causes of distributive shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Saturations have decreased since
   yesterday to low 90s, which could be due to worsening of secretions or
   atelectasis.  Alveolar recruitment seemed to work well.  Daughter
   stated over phone that children and stepchildren of patient would agree
   to tracheostomy.
   - Maintain PEEP at current level and reduce FiO2 as tolerated
   - ask Thoracic Surgery about chest tube: never paged back
 will try
   again today
   - continue Vanco / Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1) and
   Flagyl.  Stop vanc/zosy after 14 day course?; stop after 10/2 dose
   - XRT has potential to cause increased edema in lung, so will monitor
   closely with daily CXR
 XRT finished yesterday
   -continue nebs
   -Place on left side as right lobe does not ventilate; to increase
   oxygenation
   - Family meeting Saturday with stepchildren discuss trach as patient
   has been intubated for 14 days.
   - consult social work and talk to daughter
   #Hypotension:  Requiring levophed, did not tolerate phenylephrine.
   Titrating BP to MAP>65.  Appears that may be cardiogenic b/c levophed
   works but phenylephrine does not.  [**Month (only) 51**] also be a combination of
   sedation, beta blocker, and Afib.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal in SICU.   Had to
   increase levophed dose last night
   - f/u pending cultures
   - decrease sedation as tolerated; may need prn antipsychotic if becomes
   agitated
   - Continue to slowly wean levophed as bp can tolerate
   - no further diuresis today; goal of net even
   - continut to hold sotalol, which may help w pressures
   .
   #Afib:  Rate in 80s-90s mostly but bounces around occasionally w
   ventricular rates to 120s.  BPs may be low secondary to Afib.    Has
   history of Afib.   RVR appears exacerbated by agitation from intubation
   with decreased sedation; may also be secondary to decreased
   intravascular volume, though total volume up or secondary to
   infection.  Goal ventricular HR <100, on dilt and sotalol at home.
   - continue Dilt Q6hours, still have room to increase dilt dosing
   - hold sotalol as above
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, no signs of PTX on CXR.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued, monitor
   air leak
   - Consult surgery
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary chemo and possibly sepsis, but
   resolving.   No longer neutropenic. today
s hct stable at 29. WBC
   stable at 20, iikely related to neupogen he was previously on.
   - transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <20
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST/ALT trending down, Alk Phos/LDH stable.  likely
   elevated LFTs secondary to chemotherapy.  RUQ U/S showed many mets to
   liver.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc.  Has very little chance of cure
   though chemo may prolong his life for a few months. Finished chest XRT
   - f/u ONC recs

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia and subsequently developed hypotension requiring pressors, as well as hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been intubated for 13 days and is now being considered for a tracheostomy. The patient has also undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy for small cell lung cancer, which has resulted in pancytopenia and transaminitis. His current condition includes atrial flutter, hypoxia, and potential cardiogenic shock. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate in the 90s, blood pressure ranging from 104/63 to 134/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 94%, and a CVP of 15 mmHg. The patient's lab results show an elevated WBC count, decreased Hct and Plt levels, increased Cr and TCO2 levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin, and diltiazem. The patient's chest X-ray shows a large left pleural effusion. The patient's family has agreed to proceed with a tracheostomy."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Had desat last night. FIO2 had to be increased. Had recruitment
   maneuver last night with equivocal results. Eventually O2 sats came up
   on 80% on oxygen.
   Remains on levophed. Diltiazem infusion in place because of persistent
   tachycardia.
   Peak and plateau pressures are elevated today.

   =========================
   Respiratory status deteriorating with reduced oxygenation and increased
   airway resistance. Concern for resistant bacteria; will broaden
   antibiotic coverage. Also concern for pulmonary embolism given his
   tumor and the worsened tachycardia. Patient not sufficiently stable for
   CTA. Will obtain LENI's. Consider empiric anticoagulation. Unclear
   whether he benefitted from recruitment maneuver last night. If blood
   pressure stable on norepi, would try diuresing. Will remove PIC; small
   amount of pus at site. Add vasopressin.
   Tachyardia worse. Will restart Sotalol.
   Oncology has related to us that they believe his prognosis with respect
   to his cancer is quite poor, with an expected survival of less than [**4-10**]
   months. Unlikely that he will be candidate under best of circumstances
   for additional chemo should he survive this acute illness.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, lung cancer, pneumonia, anemia, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 122 bpm), hypertension (blood pressure of 118/66 mmHg), tachypnea (respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute), and hypoxemia (SpO2 of 90%). The patient is sedated and intubated, unable to provide history.

The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, diltiazem, norepinephrine, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), metronidazole, vancomycin, and heparin sodium.

The physical examination reveals an overweight or obese individual with no acute distress. The cardiovascular examination shows normal PMI, S1, S2, and no murmurs. The respiratory examination shows diffuse expiratory wheezes and diminished breath sounds on the right side. The neurologic examination indicates sedation with no purposeful movements or orientation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 18.7 K/uL), anemia (hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL), elevated creatinine (1.1 mg/dL), hyperkalemia (potassium of 5.7 mEq/L), and hyponatremia (sodium of 130 mg/dL). Other lab results indicate elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate, and D-dimer levels, as well as an elevated troponin-T level.

Imaging reveals increased interstitial and alveolar infiltrates on the left side of the chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include pneumonia, delirium/confusion, hypotension, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, hyperkalemia, atrial fibrillation, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, and acute pulmonary embolism.

The potential medical complications that can arise include resistant bacteria leading to worsening pneumonia, pulmonary embolism given the patient's tumor and worsened tachycardia. The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating with reduced oxygenation and increased airway resistance."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors and
   hypoxic despite increasing FiO2 and PEEP.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Saturations have decreased since
   yesterday to low 90s, which could be due to worsening PNA, PE,
   effusions.  Alveolar recruitment seemed equivical and patient did not
   tolerate well
   - Attempt to increase oxygenation: Increase PEEP, decrease TVs, and
   increase FiO2 to maintain O2 sats in 90s
   - Broaden PNA coverage. Will double cover for pseudomonus with cipro
   - Continue Vanco / Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1) and
   Flagyl.  Stop vanc/zosy after 14 day course, stop after 10/2 dose
   - Mini-Bal for culture
   - LENI
s today and consider empiric anticoagulation
   -continue nebs
   - Diurese if stable hemodynamically
   - 60 mg prednisone now as increased wheezing on exam
   - Family meeting Saturday with stepchildren discuss trach and code
   status as patient has been intubated for 14 days.
   - consult social work and talk to daughter
   - d/w oncologist if he can write formal rec of clinical prognosis in
   chart
   #Hypotension:  Requiring levophed at moderate doses, did not tolerate
   phenylephrine.  Titrating BP to MAP>65.
   - Add vasopressin today
   - f/u pending cultures
   - decrease sedation as tolerated; may need prn antipsychotic if becomes
   agitated
   - Continue to slowly wean levophed as bp can tolerate
   - no further diuresis today; goal of net even
   - IV tip of PICC had pus oozing, will send tip for culture
   .
   #Afib:  Rate in 80s-90s mostly throughout morning increasing to 130s
   140s..  BPs may be low secondary to Afib.    Has history of Afib.   RVR
   appears exacerbated by agitation from intubation with decreased
   sedation; may also be secondary to decreased intravascular volume,
   though total volume up or secondary to infection.  Goal ventricular HR
   <100, on dilt and sotalol at home.
   - continue Dilt Q6hours, still have room to increase dilt dosing
   - Restart sotalol as HR is not controlled by dilt gtt
   -holding anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, no signs of PTX on CXR.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued, monitor
   air leak
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary chemo and possibly sepsis, but
   resolving.   No longer neutropenic. today
s hct stable at 29. WBC
   stable at 20, iikely related to neupogen he was previously on.
   - transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <20
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST/ALT trending down, Alk Phos/LDH stable.  likely
   elevated LFTs secondary to chemotherapy.  RUQ U/S showed many mets to
   liver.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc.  Has very little chance of cure
   though chemo may prolong his life for a few months. Finished chest XRT

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia, subsequent bronchus and stent placement, and resolving pneumothorax. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension requiring pressors, as well as hypoxia despite increased FiO2 and PEEP. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including respiratory failure, potential pulmonary embolism, effusions, pancytopenia, transaminitis, and small cell lung cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels have decreased to the low 90s, which could be due to worsening pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or effusions. The patient did not tolerate alveolar recruitment well.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires levophed at moderate doses and has not tolerated phenylephrine. The blood pressure needs to be titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient had a pneumothorax on admission, but no signs of pneumothorax are present on the chest X-ray. The patient will continue to have a chest tube while on positive pressure ventilation, and air leaks will be monitored.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient likely has pancytopenia secondary to chemotherapy and possibly sepsis. However, the patient's white"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 year old male with COPD, CAD presented with post-obstructive
   PNA, s/p bronch and stent placement with evolution of resolving PTX
   requiring chest tube placement.  Now hypotensive requiring pressors and
   hypoxic despite increasing FiO2 and PEEP.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Saturations have decreased since
   yesterday to low 90s, which could be due to worsening PNA, PE,
   effusions.  Alveolar recruitment seemed equivical and patient did not
   tolerate well
   - Attempt to increase oxygenation: Increase PEEP, and increase FiO2 to
   maintain O2 sats in 90s
   - Broaden PNA coverage. Continue double coverage for pseudomonas with
   cipro
   - Continue Vanco / Zosyn for post-obstructive PNA ([**8-24**]=day1) and
   Flagyl.  Stop vanc/zosy after 14 day course, stop after 10/2 dose
   - Mini-Bal for culture
   - LENI
s negative; will continue empiric anticoagulation with heparin
   -continue nebs
   - Diurese if stable hemodynamically
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - 60 mg prednisone now as increased wheezing on exam continue 3 day
   course
   - Family meeting Saturday with stepchildren discuss trach and code
   status as patient has been intubated for 14 days.
   - consult social work and talk to daughter
   - d/w oncologist if he can write formal rec of clinical prognosis in
   chart
   #Hypotension:  Requiring levophed at moderate doses, did not tolerate
   phenylephrine.  Titrating BP to MAP>65.
   - Add vasopressin today
   - f/u pending cultures
   - decrease sedation as tolerated; may need prn antipsychotic if becomes
   agitated
   - Continue to slowly wean levophed as bp can tolerate
   - no further diuresis today; goal of net even
   - IV tip of PICC had pus oozing, will send tip for culture
   .
   #Afib:  Rate in 80s-90s but has increased to130s-140s.  Has history of
   Afib.   RVR appears exacerbated by agitation from intubation with
   decreased sedation; may also be secondary to decreased intravascular
   volume, or perhaps worsening mets.  -
   - continue Dilt Q6hours, still have room to increase dilt dosing
   - Continue Sotalol as HR is not controlled by dilt gtt
   .
   # Pneumothorax: Noted on admission, no signs of PTX on CXR.
   -continue chest tube while positive pressure vent is continued, monitor
   air leak
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary chemo and possibly sepsis, but
   resolving.   No longer neutropenic. today
s hct stable. WBC stable,
   iikely related to neupogen he was previously on.
   - transfuse PLTs for bleeding or for <20
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST/ALT trending down, Alk Phos/LDH stable.  likely
   elevated LFTs secondary to chemotherapy.  RUQ U/S showed many mets to
   liver.
   - continue to trend LFTs
   .
   # Small Cell Lung CA: Followed by onc.  Has very little chance of cure
   though chemo may prolong his life for a few months. Finished chest XRT
   - f/u Onc recs

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of COPD and CAD who presented with post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) and a pneumothorax (PTX). He underwent bronchoscopic and stent placement, and his PTX resolved but he remains hypotensive and hypoxic. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with increasing FiO2 and PEEP, and he has been intubated for 14 days.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/54 mmHg to 139/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 36.6°C.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension requiring pressors, pancytopenia, transaminitis, small cell lung cancer, atrial fibrillation, and pneumothorax.

The assessment and plan section indicates that the patient is critically ill and requires aggressive management. The goals include attempting to increase oxygenation, broadening PNA coverage, continuing double coverage for pseudomonas, stopping vanc/zosy after a 14-day course, performing mini-bal culture, and continuing nebs.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma from high"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been unstable throughout the day, with intermittent episodes of acute decompensation. The patient experienced hypoxia due to a brief recruitment event and required high levels of PEEP and FiO2 to maintain oxygenation. Despite increasing PEEP, the patient continued to desaturate, so it was decreased back to 10 to prevent barotrauma. The TV was decreased from 8 cc/kg to 6 cc/kg, and the RR needed to be increased overnight due to respiratory acidosis. Prednisone and ciprofloxacin were started for wheezing and potential pulmonary embolism concerns, respectively. Vasopressin and heparin were also initiated. The patient's family agreed to make the father DNR.

Infusions and Medications:
- Midazolam (Versed) at 1 mg/hour
- Fentanyl at 75 mcg/hour

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Brief recruitment made patient hypoxic.
   -Acutely decompensating intermittently all day on high PEEPs and FIO2
   of 60%. Intermittently increasing fio2 to 100% to increase spo2/pa02.
   Peep increased to 15, but plateau was increasing with peep increase
   from 32 to 36; patient still desaturating. Increasing peep is not
   correcting oxygenation, so decreased back to 10 to decrease barotrauma.
   TVs decreased from 8 cc/kg to 6 cc/kg. RR needed to be increased o/n
   b/c of respiratory acidosis.
   prednisone 60 mg given b/c some new wheezing noted
   cipro started for double coverage.
   dilt 60 QID and sotolal started; dilt gtt d/c'd
   vasopressin started
   -heparin gtt started empirically for concern of PE. Patient cannot go
   for CTA at this time, but [**Doctor Last Name **] would like it to happen in AM if
   possible. EKG does not show right heart strain pattern. lenis showed no
   DVT

   Assessment and Plan
   ICU Care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced hypoxia after recruitment, requiring increased FiO2 and PEEP. However, increasing PEEP led to increased plateau pressure and desaturation, so it was decreased to prevent barotrauma.

2. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's RR needed to be increased overnight due to respiratory acidosis.

3. New Wheezing: Prednisone was given to address new wheezing noted in the patient.

4. Possible Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Heparin gtt was started empirically for concern of PE. An EKG does not show right heart strain pattern, and lenus showed no DVT. However, heparin was continued due to concern for PE.

5. Vasopressin: Vasopressin was started, indicating possible concerns with the patient's blood pressure regulation.

6. Family Decision: The patient's siblings agreed that the patient's father should be made DNR (Do Not Resuscitate).

7. Antibiotic Therapy: The patient received multiple antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin.

8. Fluid Balance: The patient has had significant fluid input and output over the 24-hour"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo male with respiratory failure in the setting of metastatic lung
   cancer now with persistent and worsening hypoxemia despite continued
   active pursuit of all possible medical interventions to try to
   stabilize oxygenation.  This course has been complicated by worsening
   hypotension and recurrent atrial arrythmia.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Severe ARDS and hypoxemia persisting without
   significant response to interventions pursued to look to recruit lung
   volumes
interestingly patient has had improvement in LLL at the end of
   yesterday.
   -Will maintain increased PEEP and look to wean FIO2 as possible
   -Will follow CXR for any changes and repeat in AM
   -Continue with broad spectrum ABX--Cipro/Flagyl/Vanco/Zosyn
   -Will continue treatment for PE with heparin
   -Follow sputum results
   -Will continue systemic steroids for 3 day course
   -Continue Atrovent/Albuterol
   2)Shock-_Septic, likely pulmonary source
   -Levophed to wean as tolerated
   -Will IVF bolus as needed
   3)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Continue with Sotalol
   -Dil as needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with respiratory failure due to severe ARDS and hypoxemia. The patient has been unresponsive to interventions aimed at recruiting lung volumes. There has been some improvement in the left lower lobe at the end of yesterday. The patient's condition is complicated by worsening hypotension and recurrent atrial arrhythmia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe ARDS and hypoxemia may lead to worsening respiratory failure if interventions are not effective.
2. Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could progress to septic shock, likely due to a pulmonary source.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient may develop delirium or confusion due to the underlying medical conditions and ICU environment.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can cause an irregular heartbeat and increase the risk of blood clots.
6. Pleural Effusion: The patient may develop an acute pleural effusion, which can worsen respiratory function.
7. Cancer Progression: The patient's underlying lung cancer may continue to progress and affect his overall condition.
8. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to"
