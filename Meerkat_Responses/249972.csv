","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with hepatocellular cancer, who underwent chemoembolization and is now experiencing acute abdomen with free air. He has been sent to the ICU for closer monitoring. The patient has pneumotosis intestinalis without a clear cause, possible causes include mesenteric ischemia from celiac axis during chemo-embol, excessive narcotics, or spontaneous. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a dilated cecum, resulting in the placement of a cecostomy tube. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Abdomen: The patient presents with acute abdomen and free air, which could be due to various reasons such as perforated viscus, ischemic bowel, or diverticulitis.
2. Pneumotis Intestinalis: This condition involves the presence of gas within the wall of the intestines, leading to bowel wall distension and potential perforation. It can be caused by excessive narcotics, spontaneous factors, or mesenteric ischemia during the chemo-embolization procedure.
3. Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The patient has unresectable hepatocellular cancer and has undergone chemoembolization. Further oncology recommendations need to be followed.
4. Possible Pneumonia: There is a question of pneumonia with hilar opacity on the chest X-ray. The patient has received a 5-day course of levofloxacin and one dose of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with hepatocellular cancer, who underwent chemoembolization and is now in the ICU. He presents with an acute abdomen and pneumotosis intestinalis, a condition characterized by gas within the bowel wall. The patient had a dilated cecum and underwent a cecostomy tube placement. He has been experiencing hypotension, with episodes of low blood pressure, particularly when sleeping. The patient also has known portal vein thrombosis and is on anticoagulation therapy. There are concerns regarding his mental status, as he is lethargic and has had changes in his INR and albumin levels. Additionally, the patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to pulmonary issues, and there are concerns about potential pneumonia. Renal function is also impaired, with an elevated creatinine level indicating acute tubular necrosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's pulmonary condition is a concern, as he has been on mechanical ventilation and there are signs of potential pneumonia. Monitoring for fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation parameters is essential.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests acute tubular necrosis, which can be caused by the contrast given during chemoembolization. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is necessary. Measures to prevent further insults to the kidneys should be implemented.

   Assessment and Plan
   70yoM w/ hepatocellular cancer, unresectable, s/p chemoembolization
   complicated by acute abdomen w/ pneumatosis intestinalis, now s/p ex
   lap sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for closer monitoring.  Extubated [**2140-11-3**].
   # ACUTE ABDOMEN: found to have pneumotosis intestinalis without clear
   cause? Possible causes include mesenteric ischemia from celiac axis
   during chemo-embol, excessive narcotic, spontaneous, although clear
   cause is still uncertain. Pt went for ex-lap and had a dilated cecum to
   14cm and a cecostomy tube was placed.
   -per surgery continue cipro / flagyl
   -while ventilating can aim for slightly higher PaO2 of around 200 as
   may have benefit in pneumotosis intestinalis
   -f/u surgery recs
   -NGT to low continuous suction
   -monitor stool output from cecostomy tube
   -bolus for urine output < 50cc, weight is 100kg
   -f/u blood cultures from [**10-31**] and from [**10-29**], thus far NGTD, re-check
   blood cultures today.
   - change pain meds to morphine
   .
   #Change in Mental Status: Patient was noted to be lethargic while on
   OMED.  Still somewhat confused.  DDx: encephalopathic versus narcotics,
   1 week ago his INR and albumin were normal, more recently post
   embolization his INR was 1.5 and albumin 2.9.  Today the INR is 1.4 and
   albumin 2.6
   - will hold sedation and reassess mental status
   - will hold lactulose for now
   -trend LFTs and INR / albumin.
   # PULMONARY: no acute pulmonary process with the exception of a
   question pneumonia.   On mechanical ventilation currently, mental
   status was depressed prior to intubation per surgery.  Pt is lethargic,
   but able to respond to commands and answer yes/no questions.  Pt was on
   PSV, tolerating and extubated..

   # ARF: baseline Cr 1.3.  Admitted on [**10-27**] with a Cr of 1.4, peak [**11-2**]
   to 2.1 now 1.3.  Likely ATN [**3-5**] contrast given during
   chemoembolization.
   -continue to trend
   -renal has consulted and per renal urine is c/w ATN
   -renally dose meds
   # Hypotension: Pt with episodes of  hypotensive MAP 60's when sleeping,
   but increases when patient is aroused and awakened.
   - will hold BP meds for now and bolus to maintain MAP >65
   - eventually will restart home medications

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular cancer, which is unresectable and has undergone chemoembolization. The patient presented with acute abdomen and pneumatoses intestinalis, for which an exploratory laparotomy was performed and a cecostomy tube was placed. The patient was extubated on [2140-11-3]. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and there are concerns about encephalopathy versus narcotics. The patient has had episodes of hypotension, and his renal function has been compromised. There is a known portal vein thrombosis, and the patient has not been on anticoagulation until recently. The patient also has a heterogeneous mass in the right lobe of the liver consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma status post chemoembolization. The patient has been treated for a suspected pneumonia, but further evaluation is needed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) that is unresectable and has undergone chemoembolization. The patient presented to the ICU with an acute abdomen and was found to have pneumatoses intestinalis. He underwent exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap) and had a cecostomy tube placed. 

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include:

1. Acute Abdomen: The patient had an acute abdomen with pneumatoses intestinalis, which could be caused by mesenteric ischemia during chemoembolization, excessive narcotics, or spontaneous reasons. The cause is still uncertain. 

2. Cecostomy Tube: The patient has a cecostomy tube placed, which is being monitored for stool output. There has been no output as of yet.

3. Change in Mental Status: The patient was noted to be lethargic while on opioids (OMED), and there is a differential diagnosis between encephalopathy and narcotics. Lactulose has been withheld for now, and trends in liver function tests (LFTs), INR, and albumin will be monitored.

4. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): The patient has HCC that is unresectable and underwent chemoembolization on [**10-27**]. Complications include acute abdomen and ARF (acute renal"

   Imaging: RUQ US: 1. Patent main portal and right portal vein. There is
   flow within the left portal vein but is not wall-to-wall suggesting
   non-occlusive thrombus. Since the horizontal branch of the portal vein
   is not seen the nonocclusive thrombus might be more affecting the
   horizontal branch. There is flow within the vertical branch.
   2. Heterogeneous but predominantly solid mass with vascular flow seen
   within
   the upper pole of the left kidney.
   3. Trace fluid seen around the gallbladder but no evidence for
   cholecystitis.
   4. Heterogenous mass in the right lobe of the liver, consistent with
   HCC status post chemoembolization.
   Assessment and Plan
   70yoM w/ hepatocellular cancer, unresectable s/p chemoembolization with
   acute abdomen and free air now s/p ex lap sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for closer

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Pneumotitis intestinalis: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumotitis intestinalis, which is characterized by the presence of air in the intestines. This condition may be caused by mesenteric ischemia during chemo-embolization, excessive narcotics, or spontaneous reasons. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a dilated cecum with placement of a cecostomy tube.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3, which increased to 2.1 on [**11-2**] and is now back to 1.3. This likely indicates acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to contrast given during chemoembolization. Renal dosing of medications should be continued, and the patient's renal status should be closely monitored.

3. Portal vein thrombosis: The patient has known portal vein thrombosis, which has not been on anticoagulation until recently. The patient is currently on Lovenox, but it will be held for now and discussed with surgery when it is safe to restart anticoagulation.

4. Hypotension: The patient experiences episodes of hypotension with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 60s while sleeping, but increases when the patient is aroused and awakened"
