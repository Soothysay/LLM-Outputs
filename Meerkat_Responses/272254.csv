   Assessment and Plan
   74F w dementia, COPD, Afib, recent PE (on home coumadin), originally
   admitted for dyspnea/hypoxia, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] in the setting of
   worsening hypoxia and AFib with RVR.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Most likely from worsening left pleural effusion, likely pneumonia
   given cough and probable infiltrate on CXR, and possibly some pulmonary
   edema.  Recently on lasix.  She also has a chronic hypercarbia, which
   may be related to her chronic narcotic use.  Note that she has a h/o of
   intubation for MRSA pneumonia. Was intubated on [**7-21**]
   - will cover for healthcare associated pneumonia with cefepime,
   vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin (day 1 = [**7-21**], although she did start
   levofloxacin on [**7-20**])
   - sputum Cx, blood Cx, follow results
   - changing vent to CPAP, trying to wean, go to [**6-10**] with less sedation
   - serial ABGs as needed
   - continue chronic prednisone at 5mg daily
   - continue home dose of lasix for now, give extra as needed to help
   with weaning
   - continue home advair, atrovent, and albuterol (for ?? COPD)
   - will remove PICC once abx complete
   # AFib with rapid rate:
   Likely developed rapid rate in response to hypoxia, although rapid rate
   could also have caused pulmonary edema due to decreased filling time.
   Now back to baseline heart rate in 80s after metoprolol.
   - continue PO metoprolol and diltiazem per home doses
   - may use metoprolol 5mg IV prn rapid rate
   - during prior admissions, was not on coumadin because of ""fall risk.""
   Will need to be readdressed in future if she has completed coumadin
   course for her PE.
   - monitor on tele
   # ST depressions / elevated troponin:
   Lateral ST depressions are not new and are likely related to her LVH.
   The elevated troponin did not trend up and is most likely from her
   chronic PE, although she is fairly far out from her initial
   presentation with PE 4 months ago.
   - ASA
   - metoprolol
   # Likely UTI:
   Patient has h/o E coli UTI in [**5-15**], was sensitive to cefepime.
   Currently with UA suggestive of infection.
   - continue cefepime (day 1 = [**7-21**])
   - f/u UCx
   # Recent PE diagnosed [**3-17**]:
   - hold coumadin while in ICU
   - INR currently supratherapeutic; once INR < 3, will start heparin gtt
   # Hypernatremia: Improving today to 144
   Likely from lack of access to free water.
   - gentle fluids with D5 and recheck in PM
   # Dyslipidemia:  continue statin
   # DM:
   - continue home insulin with sliding scale
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 31-33, current Hct 33
   - monitor
   # Osteoporosis:  per chart records, however not on medications and is
   on chronic steroids
   - should have outpatient eval
   # Chronic joint pain:
   - judicious use of home medications, including vicodin
   - lidoderm patch for back
   # Anxiety and Depression:
   - continue paxil
   - clonazepam 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] per home regimen, but currently on PRN
   # Dementia:
   Frequent reorientation.  Will attempt to avoid disturbance of sleep
   cycle in the ICU.
   # GERD:  per records
   - home PPI
   # FEN:  Speech and swallow eval for possible dysphagia once extuabted;
   NPO for now
   # Access:  20g and a 22g PIV at present, PICC
   # PPx:  INR supratherapeutic, once INR < 3, will start heparin gtt;
   continue home PPI
   # Comm:  with daughter [**Name (NI) **] who is her HCP ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1158**]). Other
   daughter is [**Name (NI) 1271**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6683**].
   # Code:  FULL code confirmed with HCP
   # Dispo:  ICU pending clinical improvement, weaning vent today

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of dementia, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and recent pulmonary embolism. She was admitted for dyspnea and hypoxia and subsequently transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

2. The patient was intubated last night for increased work of breathing and hypoxia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 98.5°F, blood pressure of 116/70 mmHg, pulse of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 mmHg, and FiO2 of 0.4.

3. The patient has been sedated and ventilated. She has a history of chronic hypercarbia, which may be related to chronic narcotic use. She also has a history of intubation for MRSA pneumonia.

4. The patient's chest radiograph shows extensive collapse on the left side and now there is marked clearing with some retrocardiac infiltrate and a persistent left lower lobe effusion.

5. The patient's laboratory results indicate the following: white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.7%, potassium level of 2.7 mg/dL,"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted for dyspnea/hypoxia and transferred to the MICU due to worsening hypoxia and AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She is currently on cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin for healthcare-associated pneumonia coverage. Her blood cultures have been drawn, and sputum cultures are pending. 

She is being weaned off the ventilator with CPAP support. ABGs will be monitored serially. Chronic medications such as prednisone, lasix, home Advair, Atrovent, and albuterol for COPD are continued. The PICC line will be removed once antibiotics are complete. 

The patient's rapid heart rate in AFib may have caused pulmonary edema due to decreased filling time. She is on metoprolol and diltiazem per home doses, and metoprolol 5mg IV will be given as needed for rapid rate. 

Lateral ST depressions are not new and are likely related to her left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The elevated troponin level is most likely from her chronic PE and is not trending upward.

   Assessment and Plan
   74F w dementia, COPD, Afib, recent PE (on home coumadin), originally
   admitted for dyspnea/hypoxia, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] in the setting of
   worsening hypoxia and AFib with RVR.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Most likely from worsening left pleural effusion, likely pneumonia
   given cough and probable infiltrate on CXR, and possibly some pulmonary
   edema.  Of note, she is on chronic lasix although the indication is
   unclear.  She also has a chronic hypercarbia, which may be related to
   her chronic narcotic use.  Note that she has a h/o of intubation for
   MRSA pneumonia.
   - will cover for healthcare associated pneumonia with cefepime,
   vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin (day 1 = [**7-21**], although she did start
   levofloxacin on [**7-20**])
   - sputum Cx, blood Cx
   - consider tapping left effusion once INR is not so high
   - if patient continues to have high work of breathing, will intubate
   rather than use CPAP
   - serial ABGs as needed
   - continue chronic prednisone at 5mg daily, although unclear why she is
   on this (carries diagnosis of COPD although no smoking history and no
   PFTs available)
   - continue home dose of lasix for now
   - continue home advair, atrovent, and albuterol (for ?? COPD)
   # AFib with rapid rate:
   Likely developed rapid rate in response to hypoxia, although rapid rate
   could also have caused pulmonary edema due to decreased filling time.
   Now back to baseline heart rate in 80s after metoprolol.
   - continue PO metoprolol and diltiazem per home doses
   - may use metoprolol 5mg IV prn rapid rate
   - during prior admissions, was not on coumadin because of ""fall risk.""
   Will need to be readdressed in future if she has completed coumadin
   course for her PE.
   - monitor on tele
   # ST depressions / elevated troponin:
   Lateral ST depressions are not new and are likely related to her LVH.
   The elevated troponin did not trend up and is most likely from her
   chronic PE, although she is fairly far out from her initial
   presentation with PE 4 months ago.
   - ASA
   - metoprolol
   # Likely UTI:
   Patient has h/o E coli UTI in [**5-15**], was sensitive to cefepime.
   Currently with UA suggestive of infection.
   - continue cefepime (day 1 = [**7-21**])
   - f/u UCx
   # Recent PE diagnosed [**3-17**]:
   - hold coumadin while in ICU
   - INR currently supratherapeutic; once INR < 3, will start heparin gtt
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely from lack of access to free water.
   - gentle fluids with D5 and recheck

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of dementia, COPD, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted for dyspnea/hypoxia and transferred to the MICU due to worsening hypoxia and AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to a left pleural effusion and possible pneumonia. She has been started on antibiotics to cover healthcare-associated pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 83 bpm, blood pressure 106/52 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on FiO2 40%. Her current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metoprolol, diltiazem, prednisone, lasix, Advair, Atrovent, albuterol, and paxil.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, elevated creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 162 mg/dL. Other labs include elevated PT/PTT/INR, fibrinogen, lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely suffering from worsening left pleural effusion, possibly pneumonia, and some pulmonary edema. She is being treated with antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
2. AFib with rapid rate: The patient's rapid heart rate is likely due to hypoxia, but it could also be the cause of pulmonary edema due to decreased filling time. She is being continued on metoprolol and diltiazem, and metoprolol 5mg IV will be used as needed for rapid rate.
3. ST depressions / elevated troponin: The lateral ST depressions are likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and the elevated troponin is most likely from her chronic PE.
4. Likely UTI: The patient has a history of E. coli UTI, which was sensitive to cefepime. She is currently showing symptoms suggestive of infection, so cefepime will be continued.
5. Recent PE: The patient was diagnosed with PE on [**3-17**]. She will be placed on heparin once her INR is below 3.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium level is likely due to a lack of access to free water. Gentle fluids with D"

   levofloxacin on [**7-20**])
   - sputum Cx, blood Cx
   - consider tapping left effusion once INR is not so high
   - if patient continues to have high work of breathing, will intubate
   rather than use CPAP
   - serial ABGs as needed
   - continue chronic prednisone at 5mg daily, although unclear why she is
   on this (carries diagnosis of COPD although no smoking history and no
   PFTs available)
   - continue home dose of lasix for now
   - continue home advair, atrovent, and albuterol (for ?? COPD)
   # AFib with rapid rate:
   Likely developed rapid rate in response to hypoxia, although rapid rate
   could also have caused pulmonary edema due to decreased filling time.
   Now back to baseline heart rate in 80s after metoprolol.
   - continue PO metoprolol and diltiazem per home doses
   - may use metoprolol 5mg IV prn rapid rate
   - during prior admissions, was not on coumadin because of ""fall risk.""
   Will need to be readdressed in future if she has completed coumadin
   course for her PE.
   - monitor on tele
   # ST depressions / elevated troponin:
   Lateral ST depressions are not new and are likely related to her LVH.
   The elevated troponin did not trend up and is most likely from her
   chronic PE, although she is fairly far out from her initial
   presentation with PE 4 months ago.
   - ASA
   - metoprolol
   # Likely UTI:
   Patient has h/o E coli UTI in [**5-15**], was sensitive to cefepime.
   Currently with UA suggestive of infection.

   # Recent PE diagnosed [**3-17**]:
   - hold coumadin while in ICU
   - INR currently supratherapeutic; once INR < 3, will start heparin gtt

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and pulmonary embolism (PE) who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and worsening AFib with respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure likely due to a worsening left pleural effusion, pneumonia, and possible pulmonary edema. The cause may be related to chronic lasix use, chronic hypercarbia, and chronic narcotic use. The plan includes covering for healthcare-associated pneumonia with antibiotics, tapping the left effusion once INR is not too high, intubation if necessary, serial ABGs, and continuing chronic prednisone.

2. AFib with rapid rate: The patient developed a rapid heart rate in response to hypoxia, which could have caused pulmonary edema due to decreased filling time. Now that the heart rate is back to baseline, the plan is to continue PO metoprolol and diltiazem per home doses, use metoprolol 5mg IV prn rapid rate, and monitor on tele.

3. ST depressions / elevated troponin: The lateral ST depressions are likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and the elevated troponin did not trend up and is most likely from chronic PE. The plan is to monitor and continue ASA"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of dementia, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and recent pulmonary embolism. She was admitted for dyspnea and hypoxia and later transferred to the MICU due to worsening hypoxia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's current assessment includes hypoxic respiratory failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), pulmonary embolism (PE), hypernatremia, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), anemia, osteoporosis, chronic joint pain, anxiety and depression, and dementia.

In terms of medical complications that can arise, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being intubated for several days. The patient also has a history of previous intubation for MRSA pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, which should be monitored and treated appropriately.

Furthermore, the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be managed carefully to prevent any cardiac complications. The patient's electrolyte imbalance (hypernatremia) should also be addressed to avoid further complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical conditions and potential complications associated with her current situation."

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of dementia, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and recent pulmonary embolism. She was admitted for dyspnea and hypoxia and transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 96/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows sinus rhythm, and she is receiving fluids and blood products. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure due to HCAP, LLL effusion, possible mucous plugging, and pulmonary edema, as well as a urinary tract infection with E. coli. The patient also has hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, pulmonary embolism, diabetes mellitus, anemia, anxiety and depression, dementia, chronic joint pain, dyslipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   74F w dementia, COPD, Afib, recent PE (on home coumadin), originally
   admitted for dyspnea/hypoxia, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] in the setting of
   worsening hypoxia and AFib with RVR.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   [**3-10**] HCAP and mild pulm edema [**3-10**] afib w RVR in the setting of COPD, H/o
   of intubation for MRSA pneumonia. Was intubated on [**7-21**]
   - will cover for healthcare associated pneumonia with cefepime,
   vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin (day 1 = [**7-21**], although she did start
   levofloxacin on [**7-20**])
   - sputum Cx, blood Cx, follow results
   - changing vent to CPAP, trying to wean, go to [**6-10**] with less sedation
   - serial ABGs as needed
   - continue chronic prednisone at 5mg daily
   - continue home dose of lasix for now, give extra as needed to help
   with weaning
   - continue home advair, atrovent, and albuterol (for ?? COPD)
   - will remove PICC once abx complete
   # AFib with rapid rate:
   Likely developed rapid rate in response to hypoxia, although rapid rate
   could also have caused pulmonary edema due to decreased filling time.
   Now back to baseline heart rate in 80s after metoprolol.
   - continue PO metoprolol and diltiazem per home doses
   - may use metoprolol 5mg IV prn rapid rate
   - during prior admissions, was not on coumadin because of ""fall risk.""
   Will need to be readdressed in future if she has completed coumadin
   course for her PE.
   - monitor on tele
   # ST depressions / elevated troponin:
   Lateral ST depressions are not new and are likely related to her LVH.
   The elevated troponin did not trend up and is most likely from her
   chronic PE, although she is fairly far out from her initial
   presentation with PE 4 months ago.
   - ASA
   - metoprolol
   # Likely UTI:
   Patient has h/o E coli UTI in [**5-15**], was sensitive to cefepime.
   Currently with UA suggestive of infection.
   - continue cefepime (day 1 = [**7-21**])
   - f/u UCx
   # Recent PE diagnosed [**3-17**]:
   - hold coumadin while in ICU
   - INR currently supratherapeutic; once INR < 3, will start heparin gtt
   # Hypernatremia: Improving today to 144
   Likely from lack of access to free water.
   - gentle fluids with D5 and recheck in PM
   # Dyslipidemia:  continue statin
   # DM:
   - continue home insulin with sliding scale
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 31-33, current Hct 33
   - monitor
   # Osteoporosis:  per chart records, however not on medications and is
   on chronic steroids
   - should have outpatient eval
   # Chronic joint pain:
   - judicious use of home medications, including vicodin
   - lidoderm patch for back
   # Anxiety and Depression:
   - continue paxil
   - clonazepam 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] per home regimen, but currently on PRN
   # Dementia:
   Frequent reorientation.  Will attempt to avoid disturbance of sleep
   cycle in the ICU.
   # GERD:  per records

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted for dyspnea/hypoxia and transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia and AFib with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxia, which can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Healthcare-associated Pneumonia (HCAP): Given the patient's history of COPD and recent intubation, she is at risk for developing HCAP. Antibiotics have been started to cover for this.
3. AFib with Rapid Rate: The patient likely developed a rapid heart rate in response to hypoxia. Close monitoring and medication adjustments will be necessary to manage this condition.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient had mild pulmonary edema on admission, which may worsen if fluid balance is not carefully managed.
5. Elevated Troponin: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial injury. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
6. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of E. coli UTI and currently shows signs of infection. Antibiotic coverage should be continued, and urine cultures"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of dementia, COPD, atrial fibrillation, and recent pulmonary embolism. She was admitted for dyspnea/hypoxia and transferred to the MICU due to worsening hypoxia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent intubation on 7/21. She has a history of previous intubation for MRSA pneumonia. The patient's current medications include cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin for healthcare-associated pneumonia, prednisone and Advair for COPD exacerbation, and diuretics for pulmonary edema. She also receives sedation and ventilation pressure support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), left lower lobe effusion, possible mucous plugging, and pulmonary edema. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of COPD exacerbation.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused by E. coli, which is ciprofloxacin-resistant but cefepime-sensitive.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a high sodium level and free water deficit of 2.5L.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted for dyspnea and hypoxia and later transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia and AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has hypoxemia and is on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to have low oxygen levels despite being on mechanical ventilation.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): She has an E. coli infection in her urine culture.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, likely due to intravascular dehydration.
5. Atrial Fibrillation/Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): The patient's AFib with RVR is likely secondary to hypoxia and may improve with proper management.
6. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and is on warfarin for treatment.

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, chronic hypercarbia, pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and recent hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's pre-existing COPD can worsen due to the HAP and other factors, leading to increased difficulty in breathing and potential respiratory failure.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of PE puts her at risk for developing DVT, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism if not managed properly.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which can further complicate the patient's respiratory status.

4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of AFib with RVR indicates a predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias. The ongoing respiratory failure and other comorbidities may increase the risk of arrhythmias, potentially leading to hemodynamic instability.

5. Infection spread: As the patient has an active UTI and HAP, there is a risk of infection spreading to other parts of the body, causing sepsis and septic shock.

6. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to secondary infections and complications.

7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and apnea make her at risk for delirium, which can worsen overall prognosis and prolong recovery time.

8. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, indicating the need for close monitoring and management to prevent complications related to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

These potential complications highlight the importance of careful monitoring and prompt intervention to manage the patient's complex medical conditions effectively."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided.
   She will continue on the vent and will attempt extubation tomorrow if
   mental status improves. Otherwise, will continue with current plan.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a chief complaint of dyspnea. She has a history of COPD, chronic hypercarbia, pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's current condition indicates respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and altered mental status.

From the note, it can be summarized that the patient is receiving treatment for HAP, PE, AFib, fluid overload, and COPD. The main concern at the moment is the barrier to extubation due to altered mental status and apnea. The possible complications that could arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration in mental status, and potential infections due to prolonged intubation.

Further investigations and interventions mentioned in the note include adding diamox to address hypercapnea, checking urine tox for benzos and opiates, continuing antibiotics for HAP and UTI, controlling AFib, and monitoring glycemic control. The patient's current disposition is in the ICU, and there is an attempt planned for extubation tomorrow if mental status improves.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, mental status, and response to treatment. Frequent assessments of oxygenation, ventilation, and ABG analysis should be done. Adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary based on the patient's response and any new developments."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with multiple chronic medical problems presenting
   with shortness of breath and cough, intubated for respiratory distress.
   1. Respiratory failure:  currently being treated for HAP with
   Cefepime/Vancomycin/Flagyl.   Patient afebrile. Has leukocytosis and
   last dose of steroids was on [**7-21**].   Inability to wean from vent at
   this time more a matter of sedation as patient has periods of apnea,
   and when she does breath, her tidal volumes are low.   She was diuresed
   over the last two days with improvement in her CXR findings on the [**7-24**]
   film.  No clinical evidence of ongoing COPD exacerbation
   -Continue current antibiotics, plan for 8 day course
   -Continue diuresis in am, goal negative 500 cc-1L. She had brief
   hypotensive episode, but responded nicely to 500 cc bolus. Overall will
   benefit from diuresis.
   -Continue standing COPD medications including albuterol/atrovent nebs,
   prednisone 5 mg, fluticasone
   -Rate control atrial fibrillation, as flashed in setting of RVR
   -Vt low on pressure support trial tonight as patient remains sedated
   2.  Sedation:  Patient has been off sedation for 18 hours, but remains
   minimally arousable.  Bolus propofol as needed.  Creatinine stable and
   no evidence of liver dysfunction so unclear why sedatives with
   prolonged effect. Responds to commands with upper extremities.
   -Extubate once more awake and cooperative
   3. Atrial fibrillation: continue current medications with metoprolol 25
   mg tid and diltiazem 90 mg four times per day. On coumadin for history
   of PE, but not chronically on AC.
   4. h/o PE:  INR currently 3.2, goal [**3-11**].

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple chronic medical problems, including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, anxiety, depression, and dyslipidemia. She presented with shortness of breath and cough, and was intubated for respiratory distress. The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with cefepime, vancomycin, and Flagyl. She is currently afebrile, but has leukocytosis and a history of receiving steroids.

The patient has not been able to be weaned from the ventilator due to sedation, periods of apnea, and low tidal volumes. However, her chest X-ray findings have improved over the past two days, indicating some progress. Diuretics have been administered to address fluid overload, with positive results.

The patient's sedation levels remain elevated despite being off sedation for 18 hours. Propofol has been given as needed to manage sedation. Her creatinine levels are stable, and there is no evidence of liver dysfunction.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with metoprolol and diltiazem. She is also on Coumadin for a previous pulmonary embolism. Her INR is currently elevated, and the goal is to bring it down to a target range.

The patient has an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), which is sensitive to cefepime."

   74 year old female with multiple chronic medical problems presenting
   with shortness of breath and cough, intubated for respiratory distress.
   1. Respiratory failure:  currently being treated for HAP with
   Cefepime/Vancomycin/Flagyl.   Patient afebrile. Has leukocytosis and
   last dose of steroids was on [**7-21**].   Inability to wean from vent at
   this time more a matter of sedation as patient has periods of apnea,
   and when she does breath, her tidal volumes are low.   She was diuresed
   over the last two days with improvement in her CXR findings on the [**7-24**]
   film.  No clinical evidence of ongoing COPD exacerbation
   -Continue current antibiotics, plan for 8 day course
   -Continue diuresis in am, goal negative 500 cc-1L. She had brief
   hypotensive episode, but responded nicely to 500 cc bolus. Overall will
   benefit from diuresis.
   -Continue standing COPD medications including albuterol/atrovent nebs,
   prednisone 5 mg, fluticasone
   -Rate control atrial fibrillation, as flashed in setting of RVR
   -Vt low on pressure support trial tonight as patient remains sedated
   2.  Sedation:  Patient has been off sedation for 18 hours, but remains
   minimally arousable.  Bolus propofol as needed.  Creatinine stable and
   no evidence of liver dysfunction so unclear why sedatives with
   prolonged effect. Responds to commands with upper extremities.
   -Extubate once more awake and cooperative
   3. Atrial fibrillation: continue current medications with metoprolol 25
   mg tid and diltiazem 90 mg four times per day. On coumadin for history
   of PE, but not chronically on AC.
   4. h/o PE:  INR currently 3.2, goal [**3-11**].
   5. E. coli UTI:  sensitive to Cefepime, continue to complete 7 day
   course. Unclear if Foley changed.
   -d/c foley once extubated
   6. Hypernatremia: improved with D5W initially but starting to trend
   up.  Hold TF/flushes in am for possible extubation.
   -Recheck Na in am
   7. Dyslipidemia: continue simvastatin
   8. Anemia: drifting down since admission, but currently at baseline.
   Continue to trend
   9. Chronic joint pain: Lidocaine patch
   10. Anxiety/depression: clonezepam, paroxetine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple chronic medical problems, including COPD, atrial fibrillation, and a history of pulmonary embolism. She was admitted with shortness of breath and cough and intubated for respiratory distress. The patient is currently being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with cefepime, vancomycin, and Flagyl. She has leukocytosis and her last dose of steroids was on [**7-21**]. The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to sedation, periods of apnea, and low tidal volumes. However, she has shown improvement in her chest X-ray findings. 

The plan includes continuing the current antibiotics for an 8-day course, diuresis to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500-1000 cc, and standing COPD medications. Rate control for atrial fibrillation is also recommended. The patient remains minimally arousable despite being off sedation for 18 hours and will be given propofol as needed. Extubation is planned once the patient is more awake and cooperative. 

Other medical issues include an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI) sensitive to cefepime, hypernatremia, dyslipidemia, anemia, chronic joint pain, and anxiety/depression.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, chronic hypercarbia, pulmonary embolisms (PEs), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and recent hospitalization for superimposed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure and altered mental status. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/55 mmHg to 126/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 342 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics including cefepime and vancomycin for HAP, and her blood cultures have shown improvement. However, she remains hypoxemic and has altered mental status, making extubation challenging. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (17.6 K/uL), hemoglobin (9.9 g/dL), creatinine (0.8-0.9 mg/dL), and lactic acid (1.0 mmol/L). Other labs indicate normal potassium and magnesium levels, but slightly low calcium and phosphate levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD, chronic hypercarbia, pulmonary embolisms (PEs), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib RVR), and respiratory failure after a superimposed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to a combination of factors including COPD, HAP, and fluid overload. She requires ongoing management with appropriate antibiotics, diuretics, and possibly extubation trial.
2. Hypercapnea: The patient's chronic hypercarbia and acute respiratory failure can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing altered mental status. This needs to be closely monitored and managed with interventions such as diamox and lasix.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib with RVR, which requires anticoagulation therapy and rate control. Restarting coumadin for INR management is necessary.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PEs, and restarting coumadin tonight is recommended.
5. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is being treated for HAP with a combination of antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) and flagyl. It is important to complete the full course of treatment."

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple chronic medical problems, including shortness of breath and cough. She was intubated for respiratory distress and is now doing well on a spontaneous breathing trial. The plan is to extubate her today.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/55 to 128/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with metoprolol and diltiazem. Her INR is currently 2.5, and the goal is to maintain it between 3 and 11. Coumadin dosage will be decreased to 1.5 mg daily.

The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism and is on coumadin for this reason. She is being treated for an E. coli urinary tract infection with cefepime and will complete a 7-day course. Once extubated, her Foley catheter will be removed.

She has leukocytosis and diarrhea, and a C. diff test will be sent. She has dyslipidemia and will continue taking simvastatin. Her anemia is stable and will be trended. She has chronic joint pain and will use a lidocaine patch. She also has anxiety"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple chronic medical problems who presented with shortness of breath and cough. She was intubated for respiratory distress and diagnosed with respiratory failure. The patient is currently doing well on a spontaneous breathing trial and will be extubated today. She has been receiving antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl) for an E. coli urinary tract infection, which is sensitive to cefepime. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with metoprolol and diltiazem, and she will restart coumadin tonight for her history of pulmonary embolism. Her INR is currently 2.5, with a goal of 3-11. The patient has hypernatremia, which is being monitored and may require further intervention. She also has anemia, dyslipidemia, chronic joint pain, and anxiety/depression, for which appropriate medications are being administered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: Since the patient is being extubated, there is a risk of post-extubation complications such as stridor, airway obstruction, or respiratory distress.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation. If not properly managed, it can lead to complications such as stroke or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with multiple chronic medical problems who presented with shortness of breath and cough. She was intubated for respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. She is doing well on spontaneous breathing trials and will be extubated today. She has been receiving antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl) for an E. coli urinary tract infection, which is sensitive to cefepime. The plan is to continue the antibiotic course for another 8 days. 

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, she has respiratory failure, for which she will be extubated today. She will continue to receive diuretics (Lasix) to manage her fluid balance and possibly restart home Lasix daily. A speech and swallow consult is also planned.

Secondly, the patient has atrial fibrillation, for which she is on metoprolol and diltiazem. She will continue these medications, along with Coumadin for her history of pulmonary embolism.

Thirdly, she has hypernatremia, which has improved but is starting to trend up again. Her total fluid input/output balance is negative 600 mL, indicating ongoing fluid losses.

Fourthly, she has anemia, which is drifting down since admission but is currently at baseline. 

Fifthly, she has chronic joint pain and anxiety/depression, for which she is taking Lidocaine patches and"
