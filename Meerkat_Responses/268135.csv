","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of esophageal cancer, who experienced hypoxia and hypotension after an attempt at dilation of a stricture. She had mild aspiration and was transferred to the ICU. The patient has a history of multiple cancers and coronary artery disease (CAD). She underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and is now weaned off the pressor and O2. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 88/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient's physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds at the left base with mild crackles at the right base, as well as a small area of nodular vesicular rash on the right buttock. Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 376 K/uL, blood glucose level of 93 mg/dL, and potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L. The patient's abdominal exam was soft and obese, and her extremities were 1+ edematous. The patient is attentive and follows simple commands. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications due to aspiration and decreased oxygen saturation.
2. Hypotension and potential adrenal insufficiency requiring continued steroid administration"

   I was physically present with the housestaff team and fellow for
   discussion of the above history, physical, laboratory data and
   assessment and plan with which I agree.
   I would add the following comments
   Hypotension remains significant through to this morning.  She has
   reasonable volume status to argue against significant pre-load
   dependent state, she has elevated EF, no evidence of pericardial
   effusion but concern for restrictive pericarditis is present but
   minimal quantification of extent of restriction is seen.  This leaves
   vasodilatory state as driving force of hypotension
this is in the
   setting of nl TSH leaving possible adrenal insufficiency present.
   Alternative sources of low SVR do appear to be absent.
   Will
   -Provide fluid bolus as needed
   -Will continue to provide intermittent BP monitoring
   -Will check pulsus for possible tamponade
   -Will check AM cortisol
   -Expect improvement with continued volume replacement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a new diagnosis of esophageal cancer. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia and hypotension following an attempt at dilation of a stricture, which likely resulted in mild aspiration. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/36 mmHg to 127/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 88%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received IV steroids equivalent and has been weaned off pressor and O2 support. She requires thin liquids only and cannot tolerate medications due to swallowing difficulties. The plan is for her to have a swallow evaluation and possibly undergo a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

The patient has a history of multiple cancers, including esophageal cancer, coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation. She is currently being held on aspirin and Plavix pending surgical evaluation. Her blood glucose levels have been well-controlled.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a new diagnosis of esophageal cancer, who is currently in the ICU post-endoscopic dilation for a stricture. She presented with hypoxia and hypotension, which are believed to be caused by mild aspiration. The patient has a history of multiple cancers, coronary artery disease (CAD), and is currently undergoing a work-up for esophageal cancer. She is expected to receive a specialized diet based on recommendations from a speech-language pathologist (SLP), and her treatment plan will be determined by her oncologist and surgeon. There are plans for a possible percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient's hypotension is also attributed to some degree of adrenal insufficiency, for which she is being continued on steroids. Her blood sugar levels are well-controlled. The patient's disposition will be discussed with her oncologist, and she may be transferred to the floor after her ICU care. The patient is critically ill.

Potential medical complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent episode of hypoxia and hypotension after esophageal dilation suggests that she may have aspirated food or liquid into her lungs. This could lead to aspiration pneumonia if not properly managed.
2. Esophageal cancer progression: As the patient has recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, there is a risk of the cancer progressing and causing further complications such as difficulty swallowing, weight loss, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer status post left mastectomy, chronic pericarditis on steroids, chronic left pleural effusion status post pleurodesis, and recently diagnosed esophageal cancer.
- The patient was admitted after an EUS/EGD with hypotension and hypoxia.
- The patient's hypotension has resolved, with baseline blood pressure running in the 80-90s. There is no evidence of pericardial effusion on TTE, making CHF/ACS unlikely.
- The patient's hypoxia has also resolved, and she is now oxygenating well on room air.
- The patient has been diagnosed with stage T3Nx esophageal cancer by EUS criteria. An esophagectomy would not be the first choice if radiation therapy (XRT) is feasible. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube could be considered if the patient is amenable.
- The patient has a known history of coronary artery disease with stents and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). There is some substernal discomfort, likely due to EGD/insufflation, but it may also be related to tachycardia, hypoxia, and being off anti-platelet agents for a week. This could put the patient at risk for demand ischemia.
- The patient has chronic pericarditis and no effusion on TTE. Home dose steroids should be continued.
- Other ongoing medical issues include hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anxiety.
- The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition with thin liquids and moist pureed solids, replete lytes per request, aspiration precautions, and possible PEG placement. Blood sugar control is well managed.
- Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending further discussion with the primary oncologist.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, recent cardiac procedures, and current symptoms of substernal discomfort suggest a risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's recent hypoxia and the need for respiratory support indicate a risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Gastrointestinal complications: Given the patient's esophageal cancer diagnosis and ongoing GERD, there is a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or aspiration pneumonia.
4. Infection-related complications: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer treatment and chronic steroid use increases the risk for infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or wound infections.

These are potential complications based on the information provided, but further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the actual risks and take appropriate preventive measures."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer surgery, chronic pericarditis, and recently diagnosed esophageal cancer.
- She was admitted after undergoing an EUS/EGD procedure and presented with hypotension and hypoxia.
- Her hypotension and hypoxia have since resolved.
- She has a history of mantle radiation, chronic L pleural effusion, and esophageal cancer.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 101 bpm (with a baseline of 95-105 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 65/29 mmHg to 127/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute (with a baseline of 17-37 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- The patient is alert, awake, and anxious. She has decreased breath sounds at the bases, a regular rapid heart rate (RRR), and a systolic murmur. Her extremities show 1+ pitting edema in both lower extremities and 2+ radial and dorsalis pedis pulses. She also has a swollen left arm.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and troponin levels. Her sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels are within normal range, while her calcium level"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, chronic pericarditis, chronic left pleural effusion, and recently diagnosed esophageal cancer. She was admitted after experiencing hypotension and hypoxia during an EUS/EGD procedure. The patient has been on home dose steroids for chronic pericarditis and has a known history of coronary artery disease with stents and CABG. She also has hypothyroidism, GERD, and anxiety.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 to 129/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86% on a nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases, a 3/6 systolic murmur, soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds, 1+ pitting edema in both lower extremities, and swollen left arm. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values including electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and cardiac markers are within normal limits or negative.

The patient's current assessment and plan include addressing hypotension, hypoxia, suspected HSV lesions on the right upper extremity, staged"

   Assessment and Plan
   66F with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma s/o mantle radiation, BrCa s/p L
   mastectoma, chronic pericarditis on steroids, chronic L pleural
   effusion s/p pleurodesis with recently diagnosed esophageal cancer
   admitted after EUS/EGD with hypotension, hypoxia.
   # Hypotension: BP running at baseline of 80-90s as reported by pt and
   recent notes; pt asymptomatic on home dose steroids.  Patient reports
   that for her whole life she has been SBP 80s-90s.  Ddx is dehydration v
   iatrogenic AI for worsening. No evidence of pericardial effusion on
   TTE. CHF/ACS unlikely given nl EKG, cardiac enzymes, and EF.  CXR
   without PTX.
   -Increased steroids to pred 15mg.
   # Hypoxia: Improved - now satting well 2L NC. Suspect this is acute
   decompensation in setting of intubation with some bronchospasm given
   initial wheezing.
   -Aspiration precautions
   -Wean down ro room air.
   # [**Telephone/Fax (3) **] lesions: Concern for HSV.  Unlikely to be zoster based on
   districution.
   -DFA today.
   # Esophageal CA: Staged T3Nx by EUS criteria, with large exophytic mass
   in esophagus not amenable to further dilation. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   ([**Doctor First Name **]), esophagectomy would not be first choice if XRT feasible. Could
   do PEG if pt amenable.
-F/u any GI or thoracics recs; thin liquids and moist pureed solids per S/S recs
   -Consider Cardiothoracic c/s as inpatient vs outpatient (per chart it
   appears pt still needs PFTs/MRI as part of pre-op work up)
   -Ocologist/cardiothoracics aware of admission
   -Current plan is for PEG in IR on Monday.
   # CAD: Known CAD with stents and CABG.  Cath in [**1-/2122**] showed patent
   stents, now with some substernal discomfort, likely in setting of
   EGD/insufflation although has been stressed with tachycardia, hypoxia
   so may be at risk for some demand ischemia. Additionally has been off
   anti-platelet agents x 1 week. Ruled out for MI.
   -Continue statin
   -Holding ASA/plavix for now in case of possible surgical intervention
   # Pericarditis: No effusion on TTE.
   -Continue home dose steroids (resume po)
   # Hypothyroidism:
   -Continue levothyroxine
   # GERD:
   -Continue PPI
   # HL:
   -Continue statin
   # Anxiety: On venlafaxine at home,
   -Switch to non-slow-release version to allow pill to be crushed

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 8909**]
s note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Ms [**Known lastname 8883**] is an unfortunate
   woman with yet another malignancy, this time new esophageal ca.  We are
   awaiting interventional radiology attempting to insert a feeding tub
   past the esophageal lesion on Monday.  Meanwhile we are encouraging the
   patient to take frequent sips of Ensure to improve her nutrititonal
   status.  She has a hx of occasionally wheezing and likely has asthma.
   We will continue nebs and she is already on steroids for her chronic
   pericarditis.  Her LUE is more swollen than ususal and thus we will do
   LUE ultrasound to r/o DVT.  Lastly, she has some buttock lesions that
   resemble HSV, which we will swab and send to the lab.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer status post left mastectomy, chronic pericarditis on steroids, chronic left pleural effusion status post pleurodesis, and recently diagnosed esophageal cancer. She was admitted after an EUS/EGD with hypotension and hypoxia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 mmHg to 129/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86% on nasal cannula.

The patient is awake, alert, and anxious. She has decreased breath sounds at the bases otherwise clear bilaterally. Cardiac examination reveals a regular rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur. Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with normal tendon bowel sounds. Extremities reveal 1+ pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities, along with 2+ radial and dorsal pulses bilaterally. The patient also has a swollen left arm.

Neurologic examination finds the patient alert and oriented x3. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and potassium levels. Creatinine levels are within normal range. Other lab results show elevated troponin T levels, with normal CK,"
