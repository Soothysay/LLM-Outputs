   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   54-yo man with hypertension, dyslipidemia, locally-advanced esophageal
   cancer s/p chemo-XRT & esophagectomy, recent left pleural effusion s/p
   thoracentesis and recent pericardial effusion with tamponade s/p
   pericardiocentesis [**2112-5-23**], who was admitted to [**Hospital1 2266**] with asymptomatic
   tachycardia and is now being transferred to CCU with recurrent
   pericardial effusion and early tamponade.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion with early tamponade- has kausumal sign and
   pulsus currently [**7-25**]. For etiology it is very possible this is a
   malignant effusion vs. infectious due to recent instrumentation.  Pt
   does have low grade fever 99 and WBC 14.9. Although cytology negative,
   but low sensitivity, and still likely malignant effusion.
   - pericardiocentesis today w/ pigtail
   - Thoracic will take to OR tomorrow for pericardial window
   - NPO p MN
   - post- pericardiocentesis Echo today
   - continue checking serial pulsus
   - if tamponade worsens for some reason first step would be to give IVF
   then try pressors
   # Pleural effusions
Thoracics will drain L pleural effusion tomorrow
   when doing pericardial window
   - continue to monitor resp status
   .
   # CORONARIES - No h/o CAD, normal stress 1/[**2111**].

   # PUMP - TTEs all with EF >55%. Appears hypovolemic to euvolemic.
   - IVF hydration as above for early tamponade
   .
   # RHYTHM - Sinus tachycardia.
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Esophageal Ca - Pt s/p chemo-XRT and esophagectomy. Concern for
   malignant pleural and pericardial effusions.
   - further plans per primary oncology team, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5112**]
   - f/u thoracic surgery recs, appreciate involvement
   .
   # Hypertension - BP stable, off atenolol.
   - cont to hold atenolol
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - Previously treated with Lovastatin, but has been off
   this since diagnosis of esophageal Ca.
   - lipid panel pending
   .
   # ? Diabetes - If pt diabetic, currently diet-controlled.

   admission history.  The physical examination is consistent with my
   examination and the assessment and management describe our plans over
   the next 24 hours.  Mr. [**Known lastname 6510**] is a 54 year old man with
   esophageal carcinoma who developed a recurrent pericardial effusion
   with borderline tamponade physiologically by clinical examination and
   echocardiography.  He has shortness of breath.  We will plan with
   pericardiocentesis followed by a pericardial window to prevent
   recurrence.  The management plan was discussed with the patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer who has undergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy. He presented to the hospital with asymptomatic tachycardia and was admitted to the ICU with recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 118/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals diaphoresis, mild-moderate discomfort, oriented x3, appropriate mood and affect, and no abnormalities in the head, neck, or extremities. The patient has a history of recent left pleural effusion and pericardial effusion with tamponade. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and C-reactive protein levels. The patient's condition is complicated by pericardial effusion with early tamponade, which is likely due to a malignant effusion rather than an infectious cause. The plan includes pericardiocentesis with pigtail placement, thoracic drainage of left pleural effusion during pericardial window surgery, IV fluid hydration, monitoring of respiratory status, and further management by the primary oncology team.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer who has undergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy. He was admitted to the hospital with asymptomatic tachycardia and is now being transferred to the CCU with recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is diaphoretic and appears ill. Physical examination reveals a tachycardic rhythm, distant heart sounds, and decreased breath sounds at the bases (L>R). Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated blood glucose and creatinine levels. The patient's medical plan includes pericardiocentesis tomorrow morning followed by a pericardial window by thoracics, drainage of pleural effusions, IVF hydration, close BP monitoring, and monitoring of pulsus paradoxus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade: The patient has a history of pericardial effusion and tamponade, which can lead to cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention.
2. Malignant pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion may be malignant in nature, which can cause respiratory distress and compromise oxygenation.

2. Pleural effusions: The patient also has pleural effusions that will be drained in the morning. If symptoms do not improve after pericardiocentesis, repeat thoracentesis may be necessary.

3. Esophageal cancer: The patient has a history of esophageal cancer for which he underwent chemo-XRT and esophagectomy. There is concern for malignant pleural and pericardial effusions, and further plans will be made in consultation with the primary oncology team.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he is currently off atenolol. Continued monitoring of blood pressure is recommended."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 54-yo man with hypertension, dyslipidemia,
   locally-advanced esophageal cancer s/p chemo-XRT & esophagectomy,
   recent left pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis and recent pericardial
   effusion with tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis [**2112-5-23**], who was admitted
   to [**Hospital1 2266**] with asymptomatic tachycardia and is now being transferred to
   CCU with recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion with early tamponade - Pt w/ tachycardia, pulsus
   of [**7-25**]. Etiology unclear, may be malignant especially given rapid rate
   of re-accumulation, although cytology has been negative. Also consider
   reactive to recent chemo/XRT. With new low-grade fever, elevated WBC
   and left-shift, and diaphoresis, concern also for infectious etiology,
   especially with recent pericardial procedure, although ECG without
   evidence of true pericarditis. Blood cx pending from ED. Transferred to
   CCU for closer monitoring.
   - NPO for pericardiocentesis in AM
   - will send pericardial fluid for analysis as well as microbiology and
   cytology
   - appreciate thoracic surgery recs, may need pericardial window given
   rapid re-accumulation
   - continue IVF hydration for volume expansion
   - close BP monitoring and monitoring of pulsus
   - consider broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric coverage
   .
   # Pleural effusions - Enlarging on CXR compared to those present on
   recent discharge. Rapid re-accumulation of these also makes malignant
   effusions more likely, although cytology was again negative, as opposed
   to reactive to chemo/XRT.
   - continue to monitor resp status
   - may need repeat thoracentesis if symptoms not improved after
   pericardiocentesis
   .
   # CORONARIES - No h/o CAD, normal stress 1/[**2111**].
   .
   # PUMP - TTEs all with EF >55%. Appears hypovolemic to euvolemic.
   - IVF hydration as above for early tamponade
   .
   # RHYTHM - Sinus tachycardia.
   - cont to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Esophageal Ca - Pt s/p chemo-XRT and esophagectomy. Concern for
   malignant pleural and pericardial effusions.
   - further plans per primary oncology team, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5112**]
   - f/u thoracic surgery recs, appreciate involvement
   .
   # Hypertension - BP stable, off atenolol.
   - cont to hold atenolol
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - Previously treated with Lovastatin, but has been off
   this since diagnosis of esophageal Ca.
   - lipid panel pending
   .
   # ? Diabetes - If pt diabetic, currently diet-controlled.
   - Hgb A1c pending
   - FSBS QIDACHS, HISS to cover
   .
   # Anemia - Pt started on iron supplementation for Fe-deficient anemia
   on last hospitalization. Now with decrease in Hct from 32 to 26
   overnight, although was in similar range on prior hospitalization.
   - cont home iron supplements
   - Guaiac stools

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer who underwent chemo-XRT and esophagectomy. He was admitted to Hospital1 with asymptomatic tachycardia and is now being transferred to the CCU with recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade.

The patient's current assessment includes:
- Pericardial effusion with early tamponade: The patient has tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus of 7 cm, and evidence of rapid re-accumulation. The etiology is unclear, but may be malignant given the rapid rate of re-accumulation. Although cytology has been negative, it is important to consider a possible infectious etiology, especially with recent pericardial procedure. Blood cultures are pending from the ED. The patient will be monitored closely in the CCU and may require pericardiocentesis in the morning. Pericardial fluid analysis, including microbiology and cytology, will also be performed. A pericardial window may be necessary due to the rapid re-accumulation. Close BP monitoring and pulsus paradoxus monitoring will be continued. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric coverage may be considered.
- Pleural effusions: The patient has enlarging pleural effusions on CXR compared to recent discharge. These effusions are likely to be malignant, given their rapid re"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer who underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy. He presented with asymptomatic tachycardia and was admitted to the hospital. The patient is currently in the ICU due to recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade.

The patient has undergone pericardiocentesis, with drainage of 250 cc serous fluid and placement of a pericardial drain. A post-procedure echo showed nearly resolved effusion, and the patient remains hemodynamically stable. The plan is for a pericardial window by thoracic surgery today. The most likely etiologies of the pericardial effusion include secondary to recent surgery or radiation therapy, or malignant causes.

The patient also has a left pleural effusion, which will be drained during the pericardial window procedure. His respiratory status remains stable. There are no findings of coronary artery disease, and his heart function appears to be normal with an ejection fraction greater than 55%. However, he is experiencing sinus tachycardia that has not responded to small fluid boluses.

The patient has a history of esophageal cancer for which he has undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy, followed by esophagectomy. There is concern for malignant pleural and pericardial effusions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer who underwent chemo-XRT and esophagectomy. He was admitted to the hospital with asymptomatic tachycardia and is now being transferred to the CCU due to recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of 250 cc serous fluid, and another 130 cc was drained by the pericardial drain. Post-procedure ECHO showed nearly resolved effusion, and the patient remains hemodynamically stable. The plan is for a pericardial window by thoracics today. The most likely etiologies include secondary to recent surgery or XRT or malignant. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent pericardial effusion and tamponade: The patient has already experienced this complication, which led to his admission and current CCU stay. It is essential to monitor for signs of re-accumulation of fluid and take appropriate measures such as repeating pericardiocentesis or proceeding with a pericardial window if necessary.

2. Surgical site infection: The patient has a surgical scar on his right upper back that is slightly erythematous with a small dehisced area. This could indicate a potential surgical site infection. Swab sent for culture and sensitivity, and the patient's wound"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer. He has undergone chemotherapy (chemo-XRT) and esophagectomy. The patient was admitted to the hospital with asymptomatic tachycardia and is now being transferred to the CCU with recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade.

The patient underwent pericardiocentesis on [**2112-5-23**], resulting in the drainage of 250cc serous fluid. A pericardial drain was placed, and an additional 130cc of fluid has been drained since then. Post-procedure echocardiogram (echo) showed nearly resolved effusion. The patient remains hemodynamically stable.

A tentative plan is in place for a pericardial window by thoracics today. The most likely etiologies include secondary to recent surgery or XRT or malignant. 

Additionally, the patient has a left pleural effusion, which will be drained during the pericardial window procedure. The respiratory status remains stable.

The patient has a history of esophageal cancer, for which he underwent chemo-XRT and esophagectomy. Concerns include malignant pleural and pericardial effusions. Further plans will be determined by the primary oncology team.

The patient's hypertension is currently stable, and he is off aten"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old individual who underwent pericardiocentesis and had 250cc of serous fluid drained. A drain was placed, and a repeat echo showed that the drain was in place. The plan for a pericardial window has been scheduled by thoracic surgeon [**Doctor First Name **] for tomorrow. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 32 to 26, which was later rechecked and found to be 29. The surgical site on the right upper back was noted to be slightly dehisced, and thoracic surgery was notified. A swab was sent for culture and sensitivity. The patient remained tachycardic and received another 500ml bolus, followed by maintenance fluids overnight. The patient has no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was given. 

Infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications are mentioned but not specified. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the events described above. The flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and more.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-appearing man who is in mild-moderate discomfort. He is oriented x3 and has appropriate mood and affect. His neck shows no elevation of JVP. Cardiac examination reveals a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with distant heart sounds. There is a regular tachycardic rhythm, normal S1-S2, +S3, and a soft pericardial rub. No murmurs, thrills, or lifts are present. Lung examination shows tachypneic shallow breathing with good air movement. Decreased breath sounds at bases (L>R) without crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi. Abdominal examination reveals NABS, soft/NT/ND, with no HSM or tenderness. Extremity examination shows WWP with no c/c/e. Skin examination is unremarkable.

The patient has undergone pericardiocentesis, yielding 250cc serous fluid and placement of a drain. Repeat echo showed the drain in place. The plan for a pericardial window by thoracic surgeon is scheduled for tomorrow. Additionally, the patient's Hct dropped from 32 to 26, which was later rechecked at 29. A surgical site on the right upper back was noted to be slightly dehisced. Thoracic surgery was notified, and a swab was sent for culture"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer. He has undergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy. The patient presented to the hospital with asymptomatic tachycardia and was admitted to the ICU. He now presents with recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis on 5/29 and a pericardial window via video-assisted thoracotomy on 5/30. The pericardium appeared thickened during surgery, suggesting a possible relation to radiation therapy. The patient remains hemodynamically stable, but further follow-up is needed for pericardial fluid culture and cytology from 5/29 and 5/30. A left chest tube was placed intra-operatively and has drained 400 mL of serosanguinous fluid. The patient's respiratory status remains stable. The patient also has a history of esophageal cancer, for which he received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, followed by esophagectomy. There is concern for malignant pleural and pericardial effusions. The patient's blood pressure remains stable, and his blood sugars are stable on insulin sliding scale. The patient's hematocrit level dropped overnight, and he is currently at 26.8%. Baseline Hct is 23-27. The patient is being"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer who has undergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy. The patient was admitted to the hospital with asymptomatic tachycardia and is now being transferred to the CCU with recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade.

The patient underwent pericardiocentesis on [**5-29**] and a pericardial window via video-assisted thoracotomy on [**5-30**]. However, the pericardium appears thickened, making it unclear if the window is complete. There is also a concern for the etiology of the recurrent pericardial fluid reaccumulation, with possibilities including recent chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Further follow-up is planned for pericardial fluid Cxs and cytology from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**].

The patient also has pleural effusions, and a left chest tube was placed intra-operatively, which has drained 400 mL of serosanguinous fluid. The patient's respiratory status remains stable.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing anemia with a 3-point Hct drop overnight, likely due to dilutional effects from receiving 2 liters of fluid. Other issues include coronary artery disease, pump function, rhythm disturbances, esophageal cancer,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer who underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy. He presented with asymptomatic tachycardia and was admitted to the hospital. The patient had recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade, for which he underwent pericardiocentesis on 5/29 and a pericardial window via video-assisted thoracotomy on 5/30. He remains hemodynamically stable. 

The patient also has pleural effusions, and a left chest tube was placed intra-operatively. He has drained 400 mL of serosanguinous fluid, and his respiratory status remains stable. The patient's coronary arteries are not affected, as he has no history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and his stress test was normal. His heart function appears to be normal with an ejection fraction (EF) >55%. The patient's sinus tachycardia has improved with fluid boluses, and he will continue to be monitored on telemetry.

The patient has a history of esophageal cancer and concerns for malignant pleural and pericardial effusions. Further plans will be made in consultation with the primary oncology team. The patient's blood pressure remains stable, and he is currently holding atenolol. His lipid panel is pending, and he was previously"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-appearing male in mild-moderate discomfort. He is oriented x3 and has appropriate mood and affect. No elevation of JVP is noted in the neck examination. The cardiac examination reveals tachycardia, with audible S1/S2, and no murmurs. Decreased breath sounds at the bases (L>R) are observed during the lung examination, without any crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi. A left chest tube is in place, attached to suction, and draining serosanguinious fluid. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no bulging or rebound tenderness. Warm and well-perfused extremities are present, along with 1+ left lower extremity edema. A surgical scar on the right upper back is slightly erythematous with a small dehisced area that is packed with a wick and covered with a dry dressing.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Troponin-T levels are below the detection limit. Elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and LDH are noted. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer who underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy. He presented with asymptomatic tachycardia and was admitted to the hospital. He was later transferred to the CCU due to recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade.

The patient has undergone pericardiocentesis and a pericardial window via video-assisted thoracotomy. The pericardium appears thickened, which may suggest radiation therapy as the cause rather than recent chemotherapy. Further follow-up of pericardial fluid culture and cytology from previous days is planned.

A left chest tube was placed intra-operatively, and it has drained 400 mL of serosanguinous fluid. The patient's respiratory status remains stable.

The patient experienced a drop in hemoglobin concentration overnight, likely due to dilutional anemia from receiving 2 liters of fluids. Oral iron supplements are recommended, and a follow-up hemoglobin test is planned.

The patient's sinus tachycardia has improved with fluid boluses, and he will continue to receive small fluid boluses as needed and be monitored on telemetry.

There are concerns about malignant pleural and pericardial effusions due to the esophageal cancer. The primary oncology team will provide further plans.

The patient's blood pressure remains stable"

He was admitted to the hospital with asymptomatic tachycardia and is now being transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) with recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade. The patient had previous pericardiocentesis and a pericardial window via video-assisted thoracotomy. An echocardiogram showed organization of the effusion, no tamponade, and rare atypical cells in the pericardial fluid. The patient also has a left pleural effusion, which was drained using a chest tube. He has anemia with an improved hematocrit level of 24. The patient's surgical wound is infected with pan-sensitive staph, and he is currently on bactrim. He has no history of coronary artery disease, with normal stress tests, and his ejection fraction is greater than 55%. The patient's rhythm has improved with fluid boluses, and he remains stable. His blood pressure remains stable as well. The patient has a history of esophageal cancer and concerns for malignant pleural and pericardial effusions. Further plans will be made by the primary oncology team. The patient's diabetes and dyslipidemia are being managed appropriately."

","The patient is a 54-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and locally-advanced esophageal cancer status post chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and esophagectomy. He was admitted to the hospital with asymptomatic tachycardia and is now being transferred to the CCU with recurrent pericardial effusion and early tamponade. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis on 5/29 and pericardial window via video-assisted thoracotomy on 5/30. The most recent echocardiogram showed organization of the effusion without tamponade. The patient's pericardial fluid analysis revealed rare atypical cells in the background of reactive cells.

The patient also has pleural effusions, for which a left chest tube was placed intra-operatively. Since midnight, it has drained 100 mL of serosanguinous fluid. His respiratory status remains stable, and the chest tube is on water seal. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has improved to 24 this morning, with no evidence of active bleeding. 

The patient's surgical wound is infected with pan-sensitive staph, and a wick is in place, draining. Despite being started on bactrim yesterday, the surgery team does not recommend starting antibiotics because the wound is draining. The patient's blood glucose levels are stable on insulin sliding scale.
