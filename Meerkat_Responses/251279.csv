   Imaging: Barium esophagram
   FINDINGS: A previously placed nasogastric tube was slightly retracted
   about
   to the level where the side hole of the tube was located in the mid
   esophagus.
   Subsequently, barium was injected and the esophagus was filled with
   barium
   about from the carina to the GE junction. There was no evidence of
   leak.
   Subsequently, the nasogastric tube was further retracted with the side
   hole
   about at the level of the thoracic inlet. Barium was again injected and
   the
   more proximal portion of the esophagus was demonstrated. There was no
   evidence of stricture or leak. Barium passed freely through the GE
   junction
   into the stomach.
   At the end of the exam the nasogastric tube was again advanced beyond
   the GE
   junction into the stomach with its tip ending in the gastric antrum.
   This
   location was confirmed by contrast injection.
   IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of leak or stricture in the evaluated
   part
   of the esophagus (from the thoracic inlet to the GE junction).
   [**9-29**] CT neck with contrast final read pending
   [**9-29**] CT chest

   Assessment and Plan
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
 ALCOHOL ABUSE
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Assessment and Plan:
   49F with unknown PMH, presenting after being found down with +EtOH on
   board.  Intubated for airway protection.  Now with ?tracheal/esophageal
   perforation.
   # Obtundation.  +high EtOH level in ED.  No other known ingestions, but
   found with ""drug paraphenalia"" (further details unknown).  Seems to be
   waking up in MICU, requiring increased sedation to keep calm.
   - plan to continue sedation as is until ?perforation cleared by
   thoracic surgery and decision re: ?intervention.
   - Check LFTs.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now s/p intubation more for airway protection,
   though was noted to drop sats into 80s for unclear reasons
   (?hypoventilating from delta MS).  Doing well on AC thus far.
   - A line and ABG, wean FiO2 as able.
   - Anticipate sedation wean and eventual extubation once able to
   extubate per thoracic surgery.
   # ?Tracheal/esophageal perforation vs. allergic reaction.  Per ED team
   ?traumatic intubation vs. patient agitiation with tube in place, vs.
   nontraumatic allergic reaction (has seemed to respond somewhat to
   antihistamines.
   - f/u final read of pan-CT.
   - thoracics following.
   - per thoracics, plan for CT esophagram plus likely bronchoscopy and
   possibly EGD pending the above.
   - Treat possible allergic reaction with diphenhydramine, H2 blockers,
   solumedrol IV.
   # Hypotension.  Intermittently in the ED and in the MICU, particularly
   after getting fentanyl.  Not tachycardic.  UOP good.  However, now with
   some increased lactates.  Sedated and BP seems to respond poorly to
   sedating meds in general.  Also consider allergic
   vasodilation/anaphylaxis.  Now requiring very low dose phenylephrine.
   - Give 1 L NS now given rising lactates; attempt to wean phenylephrine
   as tolerated.
   - Repeat lactate.
   - Check blood cultures.  Urinalysis negative.  Other infectious workup
   as clinical picture dictates.
   - Trend UOP (has been good so far).
   - Coverage of ?aspiration pneumonia as below.
   - Aline placeed.  Now ABPs more elevated than NIBPs.
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.
   --Vanc, Unasyn, Levo
   # EtOH abuse.  Presumed given very elevated levels.  Appears to have
   hepatomegaly on exam.
   - SW consult when appropriate.
   - Check LFTs.
   - IV thiamine, folate, MVI.
   # Abnormal abdominal CT.  Per rads changes very minimal and may not be
   present in final read.  Does not have surgical abdomen currently.
   - followup final read.
   # Sacroileitis.  ?chronic per rads.  Unclear medical history.
   - Collateral information.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has bibasilar pulmonary consolidations, which are most likely due to aspiration pneumonia. This can be a result of impaired airway protection and altered mental status.

2. Tracheal/esophageal perforation: The patient has a suspected tracheal/esophageal perforation, which needs further evaluation and management by thoracic surgery. This condition can lead to severe respiratory distress and infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent episodes of hypotension, which may be caused by anaphylaxis, vasodilation, or sepsis. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support are necessary.

4. Alcohol abuse: The patient's presentation suggests alcohol abuse, and further assessment and intervention for alcohol-related complications should be considered.

5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) indicate possible liver dysfunction, which may be related to chronic alcohol use or other underlying conditions. Monitoring liver function and addressing any associated issues are important.

6. Sacroileitis: The patient has a history of sacroileitis, although the details are unclear. Further evaluation and management for this condition should be considered.

7. Potential allergic reaction: The patient may have had an allergic reaction to the endotracheal tube or other medications, which has responded somewhat to antih"

   evidence of stricture or leak. Barium passed freely through the GE
   junction
   into the stomach.
   At the end of the exam the nasogastric tube was again advanced beyond
   the GE
   junction into the stomach with its tip ending in the gastric antrum.
   This
   location was confirmed by contrast injection.
   IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of leak or stricture in the evaluated
   part
   of the esophagus (from the thoracic inlet to the GE junction).
   [**9-29**] CT neck with contrast final read pending
   [**9-29**] CT chest
   Wet read: Mild sub q air and air likely in the braachiocephalic vein.
   No
   definite tracheal injury but close f/u recommended. Bilat lower lobe

   Assessment and Plan:
   49F with unknown PMH, presenting after being found down with +EtOH on
   board.  Intubated for airway protection and concern for airway
   trauma/esophageal rupture that has been ruled out by imaging. Continues
   to be agitated when sedation weaned.
   # Obtundation.  +high EtOH level in ED.  No other known ingestions, but
   found with ""drug paraphenalia"" (further details unknown).  Seems to be
   waking up in MICU, requiring increased sedation to keep calm.
   - Stop benadryl and steroids as unlikely to be allergic rxn
   - Try to wean sedation as tolerated and if continued agitation will
   consider Haldol or Precedex
   - Check LFTs.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now s/p intubation more for airway protection,
   though was noted to drop sats into 80s for unclear reasons
   (?hypoventilating from delta MS).  Doing well on AC thus far.
   - Will get echo and diurese today with Lasix, follow up UOP later this
   afternoon and reassess
   - Get CXR this morning
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.
   --Continue with Vanc, Unasyn, Levo, today is day 2
   --Get sputum Cx
s today
   # EtOH abuse.  Presumed given very elevated levels.  Appears to have
   hepatomegaly on exam.
   - SW consult today
   - Check LFTs.
   - IV thiamine, folate, MVI.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with an unknown medical history. She was found down with a positive ethanol (EtOH) level on board and subsequently intubated for airway protection and concern for airway trauma/esophageal rupture, which has been ruled out by imaging.

The patient continues to be agitated when sedation is weaned and requires increased sedation to remain calm. She is currently unresponsive to verbal or tactile stimuli. There is no crepitus around the neck or thorax, and the lungs show upper airway ventilation sounds. The heart and abdomen appear benign, and there is no bilateral lower extremity edema.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
- Heart rate: 66 bpm (normal range: 52-90 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 127/73 mmHg (normal range: 95-139/60-89 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-20 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 92%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), and troponin-T. The levels of creatinine (Cr), lactate, and glucose are within normal limits. The rest"

   to be agitated when sedation weaned.
   # Respiratory failure.  Patient was transferred successfully to CPAP,
   but would not tolerate an SBT without significant agitation.  She was
   extubated and appeared to be doing well at the time of rounds, though
   still requiring significant O2.  She is still several liters positive
   for her length of stay and may require further diuresis.
   - Will get CXR today.
   - 20mg IV lasix, goal 1-2L negative today.
   - Continue to follow O2 requirements off of O2.
   - treat possible pneumonia as below.
   # Altered mental status.  +high EtOH level in ED, while intubated has
   required large amounts of sedation.  We are trying precedex to allow
   weaning off of Haldol without much success.  Should be able to lift
   sedation now that she is extubated.  Then plan will be haldol if she
   has symptoms of delirium or ativan for simple agitation.
   - PRN delirium or ativan.
   - f/u status once sedation has completely cleared.
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.  Sputum this morning showed PMNs
   on stain but no organisms.  Cultures all negative to date.
   --Continue with Vanc and Levo, today is day 3.  Can stop Unasyn.  Plan
   for 7 day course.
   # Transaminitis: consistent with alcohol abuse.  Does not need work-up
   in this setting as patient is asymptomatic.  We will trend LFTs as they
   should be improving.
   # EtOH abuse.  Presumed given very elevated levels.  Appears to have
   hepatomegaly on exam.  Social work has been unable to locate any social
   supports to date.  They will continue to work with her.
   - IV thiamine, folate, MVI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with an unknown medical history, presenting after being found down with a high level of alcohol on board. She was intubated for airway protection and concern for airway trauma/esophageal rupture, which has been ruled out by imaging. The patient continues to be agitated when sedation is weaned. She has respiratory failure, requiring significant oxygen and may require further diuresis. She also has altered mental status due to high EtOH levels, requiring large amounts of sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect her airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation when sedation is weaned may progress to delirium if not properly managed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a mention of hypotension in the assessment plan. This could indicate potential cardiovascular complications or the need for ongoing monitoring.
4. Alcohol withdrawal: With the patient's presumed alcohol abuse history, withdrawal symptoms may occur upon cessation of alcohol consumption.
5. Thiamine deficiency: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to thiamine deficiency, which can result in neurological complications if not supplemented appropriately.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is not mentioned, and prolonged ICU stay can lead to malnutrition.
7. Deep vein thrombosis"

   49F with unknown PMH, presenting after being found down with +EtOH on
   board.  Intubated for airway protection and concern for airway
   trauma/esophageal rupture that has been ruled out by imaging. Continues
   to be agitated when sedation weaned.
   # Obtundation.  +high EtOH level in ED.  No other known ingestions, but
   found with ""drug paraphenalia"" (further details unknown).  Seems to be
   waking up in MICU, requiring increased sedation to keep calm.
   - Stop benadryl and steroids as unlikely to be allergic rxn
   - Try to wean sedation as tolerated and if continued agitation will
   consider Haldol or Precedex
   - Check LFTs.
   # Respiratory failure.  Now s/p intubation more for airway protection,
   though was noted to drop sats into 80s for unclear reasons
   (?hypoventilating from delta MS).  Doing well on AC thus far.
   - Will get echo and diurese today with Lasix, follow up UOP later this
   afternoon and reassess
   - Get CXR this morning
   # Pulmonary consolidations.  Bibasilar.  Most likely aspiration
   pneumonia, vs. atelectasis, vs. CAP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with an unknown medical history. She presented after being found unconscious with a high level of ethanol (EtOH) on board. The patient was intubated for airway protection due to concern for airway trauma or esophageal rupture, which has been ruled out by imaging. 

The patient continues to be agitated when sedation is weaned, and there are ongoing efforts to reduce sedation while monitoring for agitation. The patient also requires increased sedation to remain calm. 

The patient has respiratory failure and was intubated more for airway protection. She experienced a drop in oxygen saturation levels into the 80s for unclear reasons. She is currently doing well on assisted ventilation. 

The patient has pulmonary consolidations, which are most likely due to aspiration pneumonia, atelectasis, or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). She is being treated with antibiotics and will have a sputum culture today. 

The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, and it appears she may have hepatomegaly on examination. Social work is being consulted, and liver function tests (LFTs) will be checked. The patient will also receive intravenous thiamine, folate, and multivitamins. 

The patient has several lines and tubes in place, including arterial and venous access. She is receiving prophylactic heparin and H2 blockers. The patient's code status"

   49 yo woman with EtOH intoxication, s/p traumatic intubation, now
   extubated and improving.  She wants to leave the hospital immediately.
   The team explained to her that she has been ill with a traumatic
   intubation and that it would be our medical advise that she remain in
   the hospital on the medical floor for an additional day.  She
   understood and was able to articulate the risks described to her of
   leaving against medical advise, demonstrating capacity to make such a
   decision.  She proceeded to sign out of the hospital against medical

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old woman with a chief complaint of EtOH intoxication and traumatic intubation, which is now extubated and improving. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 104/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, lorazepam, ampicillin/sulbactam, and vancomycin. She has also undergone several tests, including arterial blood gas analysis, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, normocephalic head, symmetric breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurological examination is not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, and electrolytes. However, her blood glucose level is slightly elevated at 134 mg/dL. The rest of the lab values fall within the normal range.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's capacity to make decisions has been assessed by psychiatry, and she demonstrated understanding of the risks involved in leaving against medical advice.
