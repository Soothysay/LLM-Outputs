   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt. is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis
   previously on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout who presented from
   his nursing home in respiratory distres with acute hypoxia,
   tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis.
   #Leukocytosis/Fevers: Likely related to a respiratory infection in the
   setting of possible aspiration event given copious upper airway
   secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.  However, given
   recent dental procedure, pt could also have bacteremia despite being
   treated empirically with Pencillin VK since [**7-6**].  CXR with no clear
   evidence of infiltrate, but CTA with L lower lobe consolidation. Pt s/p
   empiric dose of Levaquin, Cefepime, Vanco in the ED.  No evidence of
   hypotension currently to suggest progression to sepsis; lactate 2.7.
   -f/u blood, and urine cx
   -send sputum Cx if possible
   -would continue empiric antibiotic coverage w/Vancomyin and levaquin
   given persistent fevers/leukocytosis in the setting of recieving IM
   penicillin while at NH to cover for possible MRSA, gram negatives,
   resistent strep organisms and anaerobes.
   -D/C home dose of Penicillin VK
   -follow fever curve, WBC count
   -frequent pulmonary toilet/chest PT
   #Hypoxia: Pt initially 84% on RA at NH and weaned from 100% NRB to 50%
   FM, now on 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's. Acute hypoxia likely related
   to aspiration event as above, given negative CTA for PE.  Other
   possibilities include mucous plug given copious secretions and recent
   cough. ABG on 50% FiO2 : 7.44/37/135/26 with widened A-a gradient at
   the time.
   -Continue supplemental O2 as needed.
   -tele for continuous O2 monitoring, though wean off NC as tolerated to
   keep O2>93%
   #Tachycardia: On presentation, pt initially tachy to 120's, which
   improved somewhat with 1L NS.  On exam, mucous membranes dry and
   clinical patient appears somewhat volume down. CTA negative for PE, and
   tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying
   infection. EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia.
   -Continue IVF hydration for now and monitor HR on tele
   -Monitor urine output
   -Hold home dose of Lasix
   -Given relative hypertension, could consider starting Beta blocker,
   though tachycardia most likely related to fever/infection
   #Abnormal LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission
   of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 4137**] u/s with no evidence of
   cholecystitis. Could possibly be related to underlying infection,
   fever, and SIRS syndrome. AST > ALT, though patient with no known
   history of heaty EtOH use.
   -repeat LFTs in AM
   -check GGT to correlate with alk phos
   #Thrombocytosis: Platelet count 310 on admission, consistent with
   previous platelet counts. Etiology likely essential thrombocytosis.
   -Continue home dose of Hydrea
   -Platelet count well controlled, but continue Simvastatin given history
   of possible TIA
   #Dementia: Pt with known dementia, though unclear if this is patient's
   baseline. Patient able to answer simple questions and follow commands.
   -Monitor for ICU delirium/sundowning
   -Avoid benzos if agitated given relative somnolence on admission
   -Consider Zyprexa if hyperactive
   #Gout
   -No inflammated joints on examination
   -Tylenol [**Hospital1 **] around the clock for generalized joint discomfort
   -Continue Allopurinol daily
   #Sz
   Previously diagnosed with possible seizure on previous admission in '[**95**]
   but no longer on trileptal
   -No anticonvulsant therapy for now, continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of dementia, thrombocytosis, TIA, seizure, and gout. He presented to the ICU with respiratory distress, acute hypoxia, tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has been treated empirically with antibiotics for a suspected respiratory infection and bacteremia. There is evidence of consolidation on CT angiography but no clear infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's condition appears to be stable at this time, with ongoing monitoring and management of fever, leukocytosis, hypoxia, tachycardia, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient also has a history of thrombocytosis, dementia, gout, and a previous seizure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and acute hypoxia suggest a possible aspiration event or bacterial pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary. The patient may require ongoing supplemental oxygen and frequent pulmonary toilet to clear secretions.

2. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures indicate a potential ongoing infection. Continued antibiotic coverage is appropriate, and further investigations such as sputum culture and urine culture should be performed to identify the causative organism.

3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has abnormal liver function tests with elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of dementia, thrombocytosis previously on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout. The patient presented with respiratory distress, acute hypoxia, tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis. He was admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Infection: The patient is likely suffering from a respiratory infection, possibly aspiration pneumonia given the copious upper airway secretions, cough, fever, and leukocytosis. This could lead to worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient does not currently show signs of hypotension, there is a risk of developing sepsis due to the persistent fevers and leukocytosis. Monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure, is crucial.
3. Abnormal Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase on admission. The etiology of these abnormal LFTs is unclear, but they could be related to underlying infection, fever, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
4. Thrombocytosis: The patient has a history of thrombocytosis, likely essential thrombocytosis. Platelet count is well-controlled with hydroxyurea.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt. is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis
   previously on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout who presented from
   his nursing home in respiratory distres with acute hypoxia,
   tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis.
   #Leukocytosis/Fevers: Likely related to a respiratory infection in the
   setting of possible aspiration event given copious upper airway
   secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.  However, given
   recent dental procedure, pt could also have bacteremia despite being
   treated empirically with Pencillin VK since [**7-6**].  CXR with no clear
   evidence of infiltrate, but CTA with L lower lobe consolidation. Pt s/p
   empiric dose of Levaquin, Cefepime, Vanco in the ED.  No evidence of
   hypotension currently to suggest progression to sepsis; lactate 2.7.
   -f/u blood, and urine cx
   -send sputum Cx if possible
   -would continue empiric antibiotic coverage w/Vancomyin and levaquin
   given persistent fevers/leukocytosis in the setting of recieving IM
   penicillin while at NH to cover for possible MRSA, gram negatives,
   resistent strep organisms and anaerobes.
   -D/C home dose of Penicillin VK
   -follow fever curve, WBC count
   -frequent pulmonary toilet/chest PT
   #Hypoxia: Pt initially 84% on RA at NH and weaned from 100% NRB to 50%
   FM, now on 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's. Acute hypoxia likely related
   to aspiration event as above, given negative CTA for PE.  Other
   possibilities include mucous plug given copious secretions and recent
   cough. ABG on 50% FiO2 : 7.44/37/135/26 with widened A-a gradient at
   the time.
   -Continue supplemental O2 as needed.
   -tele for continuous O2 monitoring, though wean off NC as tolerated to
   keep O2>93%
   #Tachycardia: On presentation, pt initially tachy to 120's, which
   improved somewhat with 1L NS.  On exam, mucous membranes dry and
   clinical patient appears somewhat volume down. CTA negative for PE, and
   tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying
   infection. EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia.
   -Continue IVF hydration for now and monitor HR on tele
   -Monitor urine output
   -Hold home dose of Lasix
   -Given relative hypertension, could consider starting Beta blocker,
   though tachycardia most likely related to fever/infection
   #Abnormal LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission
   of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 4137**] u/s with no evidence of
   cholecystitis. Could possibly be related to underlying infection,
   fever, and SIRS syndrome. AST > ALT, though patient with no known
   history of heaty EtOH use.
   -repeat LFTs qday, improved somewhat this AM
   - GGT only barely elevaeted to 71
   - ? if drug reaction causing LFT elevation
   #Thrombocytosis: Platelet count 310 on admission, consistent with
   previous platelet counts. Etiology likely essential thrombocytosis.
   -Continue home dose of Hydrea
   -Platelet count well controlled, but continue Simvastatin given history
   of possible TIA
   #Dementia: Pt with known dementia, though unclear if this is patient's
   baseline. Patient able to answer simple questions and follow commands.
   -Monitor for ICU delirium/sundowning
   -Avoid benzos if agitated given relative somnolence on admission
   -Consider Zyprexa if hyperactive

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of dementia, thrombocytosis, TIA, seizure, and gout. He presented with respiratory distress, acute hypoxia, tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has been treated empirically with antibiotics and is currently in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 100.9°F (38.3°C), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/65 to 157/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Infection: The patient's presentation with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and fever suggests a possible respiratory infection. This could potentially progress to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not treated appropriately.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of dementia and the presence of copious upper airway secretions, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. This should be considered especially since the patient's initial oxygen saturation was 84% on room air.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient's blood pressure is within normal range, the elevated heart rate and fever could indicate an underlying infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of dementia, thrombocytosis, TIA, seizure, and gout. He presented to the hospital with respiratory distress, acute hypoxia, tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient was treated empirically with antibiotics in the emergency department. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has symptoms concerning for aspiration, such as poor inspiratory effort, diffuse upper airway wet rales, and copious secretions. This could lead to aspiration pneumonia, which is a potential complication in this case.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection including fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures. There is also evidence of organ dysfunction, such as elevated lactate levels. This increases the risk of developing sepsis, a life-threatening complication.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required 100% NRB oxygen and is now on 3L NC with O2 saturations in the mid-90s. Acute hypoxia is likely related to the aspiration event, and other possibilities include mucous plug or a pulmonary embolism. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Thrombocytosis: The patient has a history of thrombocytosis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt. is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis
   previously on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout who presented from
   his nursing home in respiratory distres with acute hypoxia,
   tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis.
   #Leukocytosis/Fevers: Likely related to a respiratory infection in the
   setting of possible aspiration event given copious upper airway
   secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.  However, given
   recent dental procedure, pt could also have bacteremia despite being
   treated empirically with Pencillin VK since [**7-6**].  CXR with no clear
   evidence of infiltrate, but CTA with L lower lobe consolidation. Pt s/p
   empiric dose of Levaquin, Cefepime, Vanco in the ED.  No evidence of
   hypotension currently to suggest progression to sepsis; lactate 2.7.
   -f/u blood, sputum, and urine cx
   - Given need for GNR coverage on cefepime 2gIVq24 (D1 [**2197-7-17**])
   -  Continue levofloxacin until Legionella ag back
   - Continue vancomycin (now D 2) pending culture results
   -D/C home dose of Penicillin VK
   -follow fever curve, WBC count
   -frequent pulmonary toilet/chest PT
   #Hypoxia: Pt initially 84% on RA at NH and weaned from 100% NRB to 50%
   FM, now on 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's. Acute hypoxia likely related
   to aspiration event as above, given negative CTA for PE.  Other
   possibilities include mucous plug given copious secretions and recent
   cough. ABG on 50% FiO2 : 7.44/37/135/26 with widened A-a.
   -Continue supplemental O2 as needed.  At this time on 3L and satting
   well
   -tele for continuous O2 monitoring, though wean off NC as tolerated to
   keep O2>93%
   - Overall, resp status improving
   #Tachycardia: On presentation, pt initially tachy to 120's, which
   improved somewhat with 1L NS.  On exam, mucous membranes dry and
   clinical patient appears somewhat volume down. CTA negative for PE, and
   tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying
   infection. EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia.
   -Continue IVF hydration for now and monitor HR on tele
   -Monitor urine output
   -Hold home dose of Lasix
   #Abnormal LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission
   of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 4137**] u/s with no evidence of
   cholecystitis. Could possibly be related to underlying infection,
   fever, and SIRS syndrome. AST > ALT, though patient with no known
   history of heaty EtOH use.
   -repeat LFTs qday, improved somewhat this AM
   - GGT only barely elevaeted to 71
   - ? if drug reaction causing LFT elevation
   #Thrombocytosis: Platelet count 310 on admission, consistent with
   previous platelet counts. Etiology likely essential thrombocytosis.
   -Continue home dose of Hydrea
   -Platelet count well controlled, but continue Simvastatin given history
   of possible TIA
   #Dementia: Pt with known dementia, though unclear if this is patient's
   baseline. Patient able to answer simple questions and follow commands.
   -Monitor for ICU delirium/sundowning
   -Avoid benzos if agitated given relative somnolence on admission
   -Consider Zyprexa if hyperactive
   - unclear baseline, therefore getting head CT today without contrast to
   investigate CVA
   #Dizziness and facial asymmetry
   - Concern for CVA given pt report of dizziness plus notable facial
   asymmetry on exam
   - CT head w/o contrast today to check for CVA or other CNS process
   #Gout
   -No inflammated joints on examination
   -Tylenol [**Hospital1 **] around the clock for generalized joint discomfort
   -Continue Allopurinol daily
   #Sz
   Previously diagnosed with possible seizure on previous admission in '[**95**]
   but no longer on trileptal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of dementia, thrombocytosis, TIA, seizure, and gout. He presented with respiratory distress, acute hypoxia, tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient has been empirically treated for pneumonia with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime in the ED. There is no evidence of hypotension or sepsis at this time. The patient's hypoxia is likely related to an aspiration event, although other possibilities include mucous plug. The respiratory status is improving, and supplemental oxygen is being provided as needed. The patient's tachycardia may be related to fevers, leukocytosis, and underlying infection. The abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) are of unclear etiology and could be related to infection, fever, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The patient has thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 310, which is consistent with previous counts and likely due to essential thrombocytosis. The patient has known dementia, and there is concern for possible delirium or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient also reports dizziness and facial asymmetry, which raises concern for a CVA. The patient's gout is being managed with allopurinol and Tylenol for joint discomfort. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt. is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis
   previously on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout who presented from
   his nursing home in respiratory distres with acute hypoxia,
   tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis.
   #Leukocytosis/Fevers: Likely related to a respiratory infection in the
   setting of possible aspiration event given copious upper airway
   secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.  However, given
   recent dental procedure, pt could also have bacteremia despite being
   treated empirically with Pencillin VK since [**7-6**].  CXR with no clear
   evidence of infiltrate, but CTA with L lower lobe consolidation. Pt s/p
   empiric dose of Levaquin, Cefepime, Vanco in the ED.  No evidence of
   hypotension currently to suggest progression to sepsis; lactate 2.7.
   -f/u blood, sputum, and urine cx
   - Given need for GNR coverage on cefepime 2gIVq24 (D1 [**2197-7-17**])
   -  Continue levofloxacin until Legionella ag back
   - Continue vancomycin (now D 2) pending culture results
   -D/C home dose of Penicillin VK
   -follow fever curve, WBC count
   -frequent pulmonary toilet/chest PT
   #Hypoxia: Pt initially 84% on RA at NH and weaned from 100% NRB to 50%
   FM, now on 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's. Acute hypoxia likely related
   to aspiration event as above, given negative CTA for PE.  Other
   possibilities include mucous plug given copious secretions and recent
   cough. ABG on 50% FiO2 : 7.44/37/135/26 with widened A-a.
   -Continue supplemental O2 as needed.  At this time on 3L and satting
   well
   -tele for continuous O2 monitoring, though wean off NC as tolerated to
   keep O2>93%
   - Overall, resp status improving
   #Tachycardia: On presentation, pt initially tachy to 120's, which
   improved somewhat with 1L NS.  On exam, mucous membranes dry and
   clinical patient appears somewhat volume down. CTA negative for PE, and
   tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying
   infection. EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia.
   -Continue IVF hydration for now and monitor HR on tele
   -Monitor urine output
   -Hold home dose of Lasix
   #Abnormal LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission
   of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 4137**] u/s with no evidence of
   cholecystitis. Could possibly be related to underlying infection,
   fever, and SIRS syndrome. AST > ALT, though patient with no known
   history of heaty EtOH use.
   -repeat LFTs qday, improved somewhat this AM
   - GGT only barely elevaeted to 71
   - ? if drug reaction causing LFT elevation
   #Thrombocytosis: Platelet count 310 on admission, consistent with
   previous platelet counts. Etiology likely essential thrombocytosis.
   -Continue home dose of Hydrea
   -Platelet count well controlled, but continue Simvastatin given history
   of possible TIA
   #Dementia: Pt with known dementia, though unclear if this is patient's
   baseline. Patient able to answer simple questions and follow commands.
   -Monitor for ICU delirium/sundowning
   -Avoid benzos if agitated given relative somnolence on admission
   -Consider Zyprexa if hyperactive
   - unclear baseline, therefore getting head CT today without contrast to
   investigate CVA
   #Dizziness and facial asymmetry
   - Concern for CVA given pt report of dizziness plus notable facial
   asymmetry on exam
   - CT head w/o contrast today to check for CVA or other CNS process
   #Gout
   -No inflammated joints on examination
   -Tylenol [**Hospital1 **] around the clock for generalized joint discomfort
   -Continue Allopurinol daily
   #Sz
   Previously diagnosed with possible seizure on previous admission in '[**95**]
   but no longer on trileptal
   -No anticonvulsant therapy for now, continue to monitor

His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.0 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/54 mmHg to 167/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus tachycardia.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.8 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.01, elevated lactate level of 2.7, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient's platelet count is elevated at 310 K/uL, likely due to essential thrombocytosis.

The patient's imaging studies include a CT head showing lacunar infarcts and diffuse atrophy without acute events, and a CT angiography ruling out pulmonary embol"

","Summary:
The patient is a geriatric female who was admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. She presented with fever, delirium, and signs of sepsis. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, her vital signs included a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure of 150/72 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. She is currently receiving IV fluids and antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime. Her current medications include lansoprazole, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. She is also receiving nutrition support through a feeding tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of infection indicate the possibility of sepsis. It is important to closely monitor her vital signs and response to antibiotics.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be common in older adults with multiple comorbidities. Close monitoring of mental status and appropriate management, including medications and reorientation, should be implemented.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has chronic kidney disease, and her serum creat"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt. is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis
   previously on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout who presented from
   his nursing home in respiratory distres with acute hypoxia,
   tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis.
   #Leukocytosis/Fevers: Likely related to a respiratory infection in the
   setting of possible aspiration event given copious upper airway
   secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.  CTA with L
   lower lobe consolidation correlates with CXR. No evidence of
   hypotension currently to suggest progression to sepsis; lactate 2.7.
   - f/u blood, sputum, and urine cx. All negative so far
   - cefepime D2 and vancomycin D3 of 10 day course
   - Negative for Legionella, therefore D/Ced levofloxacin on [**2197-7-17**]
   - Now afebrile (Tmax 100.4) with improving leukocytosis.
   - frequent pulmonary toilet/chest PT
   #Hypoxia: Pt initially 84% on RA at NH and weaned from 100% NRB to 50%
   FM, now on 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's. Acute hypoxia likely related
   to aspiration event as above, given negative CTA for PE.  Other
   possibilities include mucous plug given copious secretions and recent
   cough or aspiration PNA
   - Continue supplemental O2 as needed.  At this time on 10L mask with
   good sats
   -tele for continuous O2 monitoring
   - Since volume status better now, hold maintenance fluids to dry
   secretions
   - ABG to check status
   - Good chest PT and pulmonary toilet with frequent suctioning
   #Tachycardia: On presentation, pt initially tachy to 120's, which
   improved somewhat with 1L NS.  On exam, mucous membranes dry and
   clinical patient appears somewhat volume down. CTA negative for PE, and
   tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying
   infection. EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia.
   -Continue IVF hydration for now and monitor HR on tele
   -Monitor urine output
   -Hold home dose of Lasix
   - Add low dose metroprolol
   #Abnormal LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission
   of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 4137**] u/s with no evidence of
   cholecystitis. Could possibly be related to underlying infection,
   fever, and SIRS syndrome. AST > ALT, though patient with no known
   history of heaty EtOH use. D2 of admission ALT>AST. Now almost WNL
   - repeat LFTs qday, however almost WNL at this point with improving
   clinical status
   - GGT only barely elevaeted to 71 yesterday
   #Thrombocytosis: Platelet count 310 on admission, consistent with
   previous platelet counts. Etiology likely essential thrombocytosis.
   -Continue home dose of Hydrea
   #Dementia: Pt with known dementia, though unclear if this is patient's
   baseline. Patient able to answer simple questions and follow commands.
   WNL B12 and folic acid
   -Monitor for ICU delirium/sundowning
   -Avoid benzos if agitated given relative somnolence on admission
   -Using Zyprexa PRN for agitation
   - unclear baseline. Head CT no acute process.
   - Hypothyroidism may be a complicating factor here, but difficult to
   assess in the context of an acute infeciton. TSH pending
   - Give thiamine for poor nutrition
   - Geriatrics to consult
   #Dizziness and facial asymmetry
   - Concern for CVA given pt report of dizziness plus notable facial
   asymmetry on exam
   - CT head w/o contrast today [**2197-7-17**] showed lacunar infarcts and
   diffuse atrophy without acute events. Consider MRI
   #Gout
   -No inflammated joints on examination
   -Tylenol [**Hospital1 **] around the clock for generalized joint discomfort
   - Hold Allopurinol to avoid constipation
   #Sz
   Previously diagnosed with possible seizure on previous admission in '[**95**]
   but no longer on trileptal
   -No anticonvulsant therapy for now, continue to monitor

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt. is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis
   previously on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout who presented from
   his nursing home in respiratory distres with acute hypoxia,
   tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis.
   #Leukocytosis/Fevers: Likely related to a respiratory infection in the
   setting of possible aspiration event given copious upper airway
   secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.  CTA with L
   lower lobe consolidation correlates with CXR. CXR worsening over the
   past day. No evidence of hypotension currently to suggest progression
   to sepsis
   -          f/u cultures
   -          cefepime D3 and vancomycin D4 of 10 day course
   -          Negative for Legionella, therefore D/Ced levofloxacin on
   [**2197-7-17**]
   -          Spiked fever O/N to 101.2 with increasing sputum and
   possible color change in sputum
   -          Sputum positive for two morphologies of GNRs
   -          frequent pulmonary toilet/chest PT
   #Hypoxia: Pt initially 84% on RA at NH and weaned from 100% NRB to 50%
   FM, now on 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's. Acute hypoxia likely related
   to aspiration event as above, given negative CTA for PE.  Other
   possibilities include mucous plug given copious secretions and recent
   cough or aspiration PNA. At this time satting well on 40% mask
   -          Continue supplemental O2 as needed.
   -          tele for continuous O2 monitoring
   -          hold maintenance fluids to dry secretions / possible volume
   overload
   -          ABG with mild hypoxia yesterday and no hypercarbia
   -          Good chest PT and pulmonary toilet with frequent suctioning
   #Tachycardia: On presentation, pt initially tachy to 120's, which
   improved somewhat with 1L NS.  On exam, mucous membranes dry and
   clinical patient appears somewhat volume down. CTA negative for PE, and
   tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying
   infection. EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia.
   -          Continue IVF hydration for now and monitor HR on tele
   -          Monitor urine output
   -          Hold home dose of Lasix
   -          Added low dose metroprolol yesterday (12.5mg PO TID)
   #Abnormal LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission
   of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 4137**] u/s with no evidence of
   cholecystitis. Could possibly be related to underlying infection,
   fever, and SIRS syndrome. AST > ALT, though patient with no known
   history of heaty EtOH use. D2 of admission ALT>AST. Now almost WNL
   -          repeat LFTs qday
   #Thrombocytosis: Platelet count 310 on admission, consistent with
   previous platelet counts. Etiology likely essential thrombocytosis.
   -          Continue home dose of Hydrea
   #Dementia: Pt with known dementia, though unclear if this is patient's
   baseline. Patient able to answer simple questions and follow commands.
   WNL B12, folic acid, and TSH
   -          Monitor for ICU delirium/sundowning
   -          Avoid benzos if agitated given relative somnolence on
   admission
   -          Using Zyprexa PRN for agitation and HS to help with sleep
   and trouble during the night
   -          unclear baseline. Head CT no acute process.
   -          Give thiamine for poor nutrition
   -          Geriatrics consult recommends increased VitD supplements
   and will follow
   #Dizziness and facial asymmetry
   -          Concern for CVA given pt report of dizziness plus notable
   facial asymmetry on exam
   -          CT head w/o contrast today [**2197-7-17**] showed lacunar infarcts
   and diffuse atrophy without acute events. Consider MRI
   -          Stable now
   #Gout
   -          -No inflammated joints on examination
   -          -Tylenol [**Hospital1 **] around the clock for generalized joint
   discomfort
   -          Hold Allopurinol to avoid constipation
   #Sz
   Previously diagnosed with possible seizure on previous admission in '[**95**]
   but no longer on trileptal
   -          No anticonvulsant therapy for now, continue to monitor
   #FEN: S&S still concerning for aspiration. Continue tube feeds and
   sliding scales
   #Prophylaxis:
   -          SQ Heparin
   -          Pneumoboots
   -          PPI

   secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.  CTA with L
   lower lobe consolidation correlates with CXR. No evidence of
   hypotension currently to suggest progression to sepsis; lactate 2.7.
   -          f/u blood, sputum, and urine cx. All negative so far
   -          cefepime D3 and vancomycin D4 of 10 day course
   -          Negative for Legionella, therefore D/Ced levofloxacin on
   [**2197-7-17**]
   -          Spiked fever O/N to 101.2 with increasing sputum and
   possible color change in sputum
   -          frequent pulmonary toilet/chest PT
   #Hypoxia: Pt initially 84% on RA at NH and weaned from 100% NRB to 50%
   FM, now on 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's. Acute hypoxia likely related
   to aspiration event as above, given negative CTA for PE.  Other
   possibilities include mucous plug given copious secretions and recent
   cough or aspiration PNA
   -          Continue supplemental O2 as needed.  At this time on 10L
   mask with good sats
   -          -tele for continuous O2 monitoring
   -          Since volume status better now, hold maintenance fluids to
   dry secretions
   -          ABG with mild hypoxia yesterday and no hypercarbia
   -          Good chest PT and pulmonary toilet with frequent suctioning
   #Tachycardia: On presentation, pt initially tachy to 120's, which
   improved somewhat with 1L NS.  On exam, mucous membranes dry and
   clinical patient appears somewhat volume down. CTA negative for PE, and
   tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying
   infection. EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia.
   -          -Continue IVF hydration for now and monitor HR on tele
   -          -Monitor urine output
   -          -Hold home dose of Lasix
   -          Added low dose metroprolol yesterday (12.5mg PO TID)
   #Abnormal LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission
   of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 4137**] u/s with no evidence of

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of dementia, thrombocytosis, TIA, seizure, and gout. He presented with respiratory distress, acute hypoxia, tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient's condition is consistent with a respiratory infection, possibly aspiration pneumonia. He was started on a 10-day course of cefepime and vancomycin. His fever has increased, and there is a possible change in sputum color. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen and has shown improvement in his oxygen saturation levels. His volume status is being monitored, and he is on IV fluids. The patient's tachycardia is likely related to fevers, leukocytosis, and underlying infection. His LFTs are abnormal, but almost within normal limits now. The patient has thrombocytosis, likely essential thrombocytosis, and is on hydroxyurea. His dementia is being monitored, and he is receiving Zyprexa PRN for agitation. The patient has dizziness and facial asymmetry, which may indicate a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). An MRI is considered to further evaluate this. The patient's gout is not currently inflamed, and he is receiving Tylenol for joint discomfort. His seizure disorder is being monitored, and no anticonvulsant therapy is currently being given. The patient is on various proph"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Pt. is a 87 y/o with a history of Dementia, thrombocytosis
   previously on hydroxyurea, TIA, seizure, and gout who presented from
   his nursing home in respiratory distres with acute hypoxia,
   tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis.
   #Leukocytosis/Fevers: Likely related to a respiratory infection in the
   setting of possible aspiration event given copious upper airway
   secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.  CTA with L
   lower lobe consolidation correlates with CXR. No evidence of
   hypotension currently to suggest progression to sepsis; lactate 2.7.
   -          f/u blood, sputum, and urine cx. All negative so far
   -          cefepime D3 and vancomycin D4 of 10 day course
   -          Negative for Legionella, therefore D/Ced levofloxacin on
   [**2197-7-17**]
   -          Spiked fever O/N to 101.2 with increasing sputum and
   possible color change in sputum
   -          Sputum positive for two morphologies of GNRs
   -          frequent pulmonary toilet/chest PT
   #Hypoxia: Pt initially 84% on RA at NH and weaned from 100% NRB to 50%
   FM, now on 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's. Acute hypoxia likely related
   to aspiration event as above, given negative CTA for PE.  Other
   possibilities include mucous plug given copious secretions and recent
   cough or aspiration PNA
   -          Continue supplemental O2 as needed.  At this time on 10L
   mask with good sats
   -          -tele for continuous O2 monitoring
   -          Since volume status better now, hold maintenance fluids to
   dry secretions
   -          ABG with mild hypoxia yesterday and no hypercarbia
   -          Good chest PT and pulmonary toilet with frequent suctioning
   #Tachycardia: On presentation, pt initially tachy to 120's, which
   improved somewhat with 1L NS.  On exam, mucous membranes dry and
   clinical patient appears somewhat volume down. CTA negative for PE, and
   tachycardia could be related to fevers, leukocytosis and underlying
   infection. EKG consistent with sinus tachycardia.
   -          -Continue IVF hydration for now and monitor HR on tele
   -          -Monitor urine output
   -          -Hold home dose of Lasix
   -          Added low dose metroprolol yesterday (12.5mg PO TID)
   #Abnormal LFTs: Elevated transaminases, alk phos and LDH on admission
   of unclear etiology given normal [**Name (NI) 4137**] u/s with no evidence of
   cholecystitis. Could possibly be related to underlying infection,
   fever, and SIRS syndrome. AST > ALT, though patient with no known
   history of heaty EtOH use. D2 of admission ALT>AST. Now almost WNL
   -          repeat LFTs qday, however almost WNL at this point with
   improving clinical status
   #Thrombocytosis: Platelet count 310 on admission, consistent with
   previous platelet counts. Etiology likely essential thrombocytosis.
   -          Continue home dose of Hydrea
   #Dementia: Pt with known dementia, though unclear if this is patient's
   baseline. Patient able to answer simple questions and follow commands.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of dementia, thrombocytosis, TIA, seizure, and gout. He presented with respiratory distress, acute hypoxia, tachycardia, fevers, and leukocytosis. The patient was initially on 100% NRB oxygen and has been weaned down to 50% FM with O2 sats in the mid-90s. He is now on 3L NC with good sats. The patient's initial platelet count was 310,000 and is currently 297,000. His WBC count was 17.8 on admission and is now 10.4. The patient's LFTs are elevated but almost within normal limits now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Infection: The patient shows signs of a respiratory infection, such as cough, fever, leukocytosis, and consolidation on chest X-ray. This could potentially lead to pneumonia.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has copious upper airway secretions, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: Although there is no evidence of hypotension currently, the patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an underlying infection that may progress to sepsis if not managed appropriately.
4. Delirium: The patient has been reported to be delirious, which can be a complication in"
