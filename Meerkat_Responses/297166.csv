","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, and possible hypercarbia/obstructive sleep apnea. His current medications include oxycodone and cannabinoids. The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, normal heart sounds, and symmetric chest expansion. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated potassium levels, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Imaging reveals massive cardiomegaly with a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to be in respiratory failure, as indicated by his need for mechanical ventilation and hypercarbic respiratory failure at OSH.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can lead to worsening lung infection and respiratory distress.
3. Diabetic complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II increases the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.
5. Cardiac issues: The chest X-ray findings of massive cardiomegaly with a widened mediastin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, hypoxia, and positive cannabinoids on toxicology screen. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. The patient was intubated upon transfer from another hospital and received vancomycin upon arrival for empiric coverage. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and his condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to have hypercarbic respiratory failure based on the PCO2 levels at OSH. Oxygenation is currently well-maintained on the ventilator.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a widened mediastinum on the chest X-ray, which may be due to habitus. There is low suspicion for aortic dissection given the absence of pain. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to evaluate for aortic dissection and right heart strain.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although there is a low suspicion for DVT, it is important to evaluate for it due to immobilization. A lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENIS) will be performed to assess for DVT.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the risk factors, a V/Q scan may be difficult to perform due to the abnormal chest X-ray. A"

   56M transferred from OSH, intubated for altered mental status
   - AMS: Unclear etiology, ? hypercarbia/OSA, with cannabinoids on board,
   also takes oxycodone at home
 Neuro consult: appreciate recs, no focal deficits, unlikely to be an
   acute CVA, further recs pending
 Unable to obtain head CT given weight limit of CT table
 however pt
   remains nonfocal on exam so acute ICH or CVA seems unlikely
 Infectious workup: so far negative, no suggestion of meningitis,
   afebrile
 Contact PCP regarding use of CPAP at home
 Switch to propofol for ease of neuro examinations
 consider EEG, will await neuro recs
   - Widened mediastinum: [**Month (only) 51**] be due to habitus, no hx trauma, absence of
   pain makes dissection unlikely.
 TEE today
 low suspicion for dissection given absence of pain
   - Respiratory failure: Appears to be hypercarbic based on PcO2 70s at
   OSH.
 Oxygenating well on vent, currently on PS settings
 LENIS to eval for DVT although low suspicion for PE
 VQ may be difficult given abnormal CXR, cannot get CTA, hold on
   heparin until aorta evaluated by echo
 Echo to eval for R heart strain
 Hold on treating for COPD exacerbation for now with steroids, no

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and hypoxia. The patient was intubated upon arrival at the hospital and is currently being treated in the ICU. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/63 to 138/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance at 29.4 cmH2O/mL.

Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels at 181 mg/dL, slightly low potassium level at 3.1 mEq/L, and normal white blood cell count at 10.4 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Imaging findings include massive cardiomegaly with a widened mediastinum on chest X-ray, but no focal infiltrate. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no ST elevations or depressions.

   # Altered mental status: Slightly improving, based on efforts to
   communicate while on vent, and purposeful movements with all limbs.
   Broad differential. Hypercarbic, although overall condition appears to
   be slowly improving, despite PCO2 remaining in the 60s. pH is
   improving, with normal lactic acid. Given history, oxycodone/cannabis
   use may have made more somnolent. Also likely has significant
   obstructive sleep apnea component. CVA possible, but patient's habitus
   precludes him from fitting in CT scanner. Neurology consult service
   reports no focal neurologic deficits. Infectious etiology possible,
   given positive sputum gram stain
   - Continue to adjust ventilator to improve ventilation
   - F/u neuro recs
   - F/u cultures
   - Wean sedation for better eval

   # Respiratory distress: Has risk factors for PE (obesity, immobility)
   but unable to rule in/out as body habitus precludes CTA. LENI's
   negative for LE DVT. Ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes x3. Positive
   sputum gram stain may represent pneumonia. Dissection ruled out by TEE.
   Tolerating CPAP overnight; likely requires significant PEEP, given
   habitus
   - F/u sputum culture
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia: Single run of eight beats. Electrolytes
   generally normal. Per admission notes, patient takes beta blocker at
   home--has been held here to this point for ?hypotension.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and hypoxia. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is slightly improving, but he remains somnolent. There is a broad differential for this condition, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and possible central nervous system (CVA) involvement. Neurology consult service reports no focal neurologic deficits. Infectious etiology is also considered given the positive sputum gram stain.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient has risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE), such as obesity and immobility. However, it is not possible to rule in or out PE due to the patient's body habitus precluding computed tomography angiography (CTA). Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis (LE DVT) is negative. Myocardial infarction (MI) has been ruled out by cardiac enzymes x3. Positive sputum gram stain may indicate pneumonia. The patient tolerated continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) overnight and likely requires significant positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) due to his habitus.

3. Wide complex tachycardia: The patient experienced a single run of eight beats of"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 y/o M PMH diabetes, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents with altered
   mental status and hypoxia
   .
   # Altered mental status: Slightly improving, based on efforts to
   communicate while on vent, and purposeful movements with all limbs.
   Broad differential. Hypercarbic, although overall condition appears to
   be slowly improving, despite PCO2 remaining in the 60s. pH is
   improving, with normal lactic acid. Given history, oxycodone/cannabis
   use may have made more somnolent. Also likely has significant
   obstructive sleep apnea component. CVA possible, but patient's habitus
   precludes him from fitting in CT scanner. Neurology consult service
   reports no focal neurologic deficits. Infectious etiology possible,
   given positive sputum gram stain
   - Continue to adjust ventilator to improve ventilation
   - F/u neuro recs
   - F/u cultures
   - Wean sedation for possible extubation (currently PSV 8/2
 SBT)
   - Per outside records, not extremely difficult extuabtion
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Has risk factors for PE (obesity, immobility)
   but unable to rule in/out as body habitus precludes CTA. LENI's
   negative for LE DVT. Ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes x3. Positive
   sputum gram stain may represent pneumonia.  Some concern about
   increased secretions overnight also. Dissection ruled out by TEE.
   Tolerating CPAP overnight; likely requires significant PEEP, given
   habitus
   - F/u sputum culture
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Continue abx
 will check vanc trough
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia: Single run of eight beats. Electrolytes
   generally normal. Per admission notes, patient takes beta blocker at
   home--has been held here to this point for ?hypotension.
   - C/w telemetry
   - Start metoprolol tartrate for more precise control (12.5 [**Hospital1 7**]); should
   not have as significant anti-hypertensive effect as patient's home
   lisinopril, HCTZ
   .
   # Asthma: C/w NEBs
   .
   # Diabetes: sliding scale
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic. Slow trend down from 36.2 -> 30.9 since
   admission. No clear signs of bleed.
   - Guaiac stools if having bowel movements
   - Trend
   .
   # HTN: Restarting metoprolol, as above. Hold HCTZ, lisinopril
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Lipitor in setting of transaminitis.
   .
   # GERD: Convert omeprazole to IV pantoprazole.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presents with altered mental status, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition appears to be slowly improving, but he still has elevated PCO2 levels in the 60s. His pH is improving, and his lactic acid levels are normal. There are concerns about obstructive sleep apnea and possible pneumonia. The patient's habitus makes it difficult to rule out a pulmonary embolism or perform a CT scan. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has risk factors for pulmonary embolism (obesity, immobility), but it cannot be ruled in or out due to body habitus. The positive sputum gram stain may indicate pneumonia. The patient is tolerating CPAP overnight and requires significant PEEP.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has slightly improving altered mental status. Broad differentials include hypercarbic respiratory failure, central nervous system (CVA), infectious etiology, or obstructive sleep apnea.
3. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient experienced a single run of eight beats of wide complex tachycardia. Electrolytes are generally normal, and the patient takes beta blockers at home.
4. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia with a decreasing hemoglobin level since admission. No clear signs of bleed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man who was transferred to the ICU for altered mental status and respiratory failure. He has a history of asthma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, non-stable angina, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and possibly non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The patient was found to have cannabinoids on board and takes oxycodone at home. His respiratory failure appears to be hypercarbic, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has been treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with vancomycin given for Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) on sputum gram stain. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and underwent an esophageal echo and ultrasound. His heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block, and his blood pressure is elevated. The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema, warm skin, and normal neurologic function. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, glucose levels, and troponin T. Imaging shows increased left base opacity on chest X-ray. The patient's condition has improved since admission, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's respiratory failure and current intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and lower extremity"

   Assessment and Plan
   56M transferred from OSH, intubated for altered mental status
   - AMS: Unclear etiology, ? hypercarbia/OSA, with cannabinoids on board,
   also takes oxycodone at home
 Neuro consult: appreciate recs, no focal deficits, unlikely to be an
   acute CVA, further recs pending
 Unable to obtain head CT given weight limit of CT table
 however pt
   remains nonfocal on exam so acute ICH or CVA seems unlikely
 Infectious workup: so far negative, no suggestion of meningitis,
   afebrile
 Contact PCP regarding use of CPAP at home
 Switch to propofol for ease of neuro examinations
 consider EEG, will await neuro recs
   - Widened mediastinum: [**Month (only) 51**] be due to habitus, no hx trauma, absence of
   pain makes dissection unlikely.
 TEE today
 low suspicion for dissection given absence of pain
   - Respiratory failure: Appears to be hypercarbic based on PcO2 70s at
   OSH.
 Oxygenating well on vent, currently on PS settings
 LENIS to eval for DVT although low suspicion for PE
 VQ may be difficult given abnormal CXR, cannot get CTA, hold on
   heparin until aorta evaluated by echo
 Echo to eval for R heart strain
 Hold on treating for COPD exacerbation for now with steroids, no
   wheezing, continue MDIs
 Received Vanc/CTX on arrival for empiric coverage
 will do 5 d
   course of CTX/Azithro/Vanco pending cx data
 Wean vent as tolerated, consider SBT later today
 eval for auto-peep, if high then start steroids
 aline
 sputum: GPCs on gram stain
 on Vanco
   - Asthma hx: No e/o acute flare now
 nebs standing
 hold on steroids for now

   56 y/o M PMH diabetes, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents with altered
   mental status and hypoxia
   .
   # Altered mental status: Improved, now off sedation. Oriented x 3.
   - F/u neuro recs
   - F/u cultures
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Extubated, breathing comfortably. Sputum gram
   stain with GPC's but sparse commensal respiratory flora on preliminary
   culture. On ceftriaxone/azithromycin/vancomycin (started [**2-26**])
   - F/u final sputum culture
   - C/w vanco/azithromycin, given sputum findings
   - ID approval for vancomycin beyond today
   - Consider d/c ceftriaxone, as vancomycin covering gram positives

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and hypoxia. His respiratory distress improved after being extubated, and he is now breathing comfortably. The preliminary culture of his sputum shows the presence of Gram-positive cocci (GPCs), but the respiratory flora is sparse. He is currently on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's sputum culture showed GPCs, indicating a possible respiratory infection. The antibiotics prescribed may help in treating the infection, but further evaluation is needed to confirm the type of infection and determine the effectiveness of the current treatment.

2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and experienced moderate control overnight. It is essential to monitor his blood pressure and adjust his anti-hypertensive medications accordingly.

3. Asthma: The patient's asthma is currently being managed with nebulizers. It is crucial to ensure proper control of his asthma symptoms and provide appropriate inhaler therapy.

4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with a sliding scale. Regular monitoring of his blood glucose levels is necessary to maintain optimal glycemic control.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stabilized, but close monitoring of his hematocrit levels is recommended to prevent any further deterioration.
