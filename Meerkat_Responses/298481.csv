         2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   BUDDING YEAST WITH PSEUDOHYPHAE.
   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with hx of diabetes, parkinsons, demetia who presents with
   bibasilar pneumona and sepsis.
   Sepsis/Pneumonia: Likely source is pulmonary.  He required intubation
   for agitation and ? aspiration during line placement.  His infection is
   complicated by severe dehydration and hypernatremia. Lactate initailly
   9.0 but responded to fluids and now in normal range. Urine legionella
   Ag Negative.  Currently on propofol for sedation which may be affecting
   his blood pressures.
   - IV Fluids to keep MAP>60, CVP>12, and UOP>30
   - Wean levaphed as tolerated
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   - continue vanc, levo, flagyl
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - AM CXR
   Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubed in the emergency room for
   agitation and concern for his airway.  Currently requiring minimal
   ventilatory support.  Will plan to wean propofol, perform SBT and
   consider extubation this morning.
   - wean propofol
   - SBT
   - RSBI
   - consider extubation this morning
    Hypernatremia: Patient was extremely dry on exam with initial Na of
   174 which came down with IV hydration.  Likely due to sepsis.
   Calculated free H2O deficit of ~8L.
   - Q6h Na checks
   - D5
 NS to correct Na by [**11-19**] tonight.
   - can transition to flushes down OG tube once more stable
   .
    ARF: FeNa of 1.8 after 6 L of NS suggesting he was pre-renal. Now
   resolved
   - monitor UOP and cr
   DM type II:  Arrived with glucoses in the 300 range likely [**12-20**] to
   sepsis.  Was on Metformin which may have compounded lactic acidosis.
   - hold metformin and glyburide
   - ISS
   Parkinsons: Was tremulous on presentation, but without significant
   rigidity.
   - continue sinemet down OGT
   Alzhemers Demetia: Unclear baseline mental status
   - continue aricept.
   Glaucoma: continue eye drops.
   FEN: NS for resuscitation and D5
 NS for hyponatremia, replete
   electrolytes, Nutrition consult for tube feeds.
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. He presented with bibasilar pneumonia and sepsis, and required intubation for agitation and suspected aspiration during line placement. His infection is complicated by severe dehydration and hypernatremia. The patient's initial lactate level was high but responded to fluids and is now within normal range. Urine Legionella Ag test is negative. The patient's current condition includes sepsis/pneumonia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure (ARF), nongap metabolic acidosis, type II diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's dementia, and glaucoma.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - due to prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Stress ulcers - due to critical illness and medications.
4. Hypotension - due to sepsis and dehydration.
5. Hyperglycemia - due to stress response and diabetes.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - due to hypoperfusion from hypotension and dehydration.
7. Nosocomial infections - due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures.
8. Delirium - due to multiple comorbidities, medication effects, and ICU environment.
9. Pressure injuries - due to"

   for agitation and ? aspiration during line placement.  His infection is
   complicated by severe dehydration and hypernatremia. Lactate initailly
   9.0 but responded to fluids and now in normal range.
   - IV Fluids to keep MAP>60, CVP>12, and UOP>30

   # Hypernatremia: Patient was extremely dry on exam with initial Na of
   174 which came down with IV hydration.  Likely due to sepsis.
   Calculated free H2O deficit of ~8L.
   - Q4h Na checks
   - IV NS for resuscitation
   - D5 Water to correct Na by [**11-20**] to [**11-19**] tonight.
   - can transition to flushes down OG tube once more stable
   .
   # ARF: FeNa of 1.8 after 6 L of NS suggesting he was pre-renal. Now
   resolved
   - monitor UOP and cr
   .
   # DM type II:  Arrived with glucoses in the 300 range likely [**12-20**] to
   sepsis.  Was on Metformin which may have compounded lactic acidosis.
   - hold metformin and glyburide
   - ISS
   .
   # Parkinsons: Was tremulous on presentation, but without significant
   rigidity.
   - continue sinemet down OGT

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. He was admitted to the ICU due to bibasilar pneumonia and septic shock. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is currently stable on minimal ventilator settings. His respiratory system is clear, with good RSBI and minimal secretions. He is sedated but responsive to commands. The patient's sepsis is being managed with fluids and antibiotics, and his hypernatremia is being treated with hypotonic fluid resuscitation. He is oliguric but improving, and his acute kidney injury is resolving with fluids and sepsis management. The patient's diabetes management will continue with insulin and medication adjustments. His Parkinson's disease management will also continue with Sinemet. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being monitored closely. He has multiple lines and is receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team is implementing measures to prevent VAP, including elevation of the head of bed, daily wake-up calls, and maintaining a good respiratory system infection probability (RSBI).
2. nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocomprom"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. He presents with bilateral pneumonia and septic shock. The patient is intubated for airway protection due to possible aspiration during line placement. He is currently stable on minimal ventilator settings and has good respiratory system compliance and gag reflex. The plan is to wean sedation on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and possibly extubate if tolerated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he does not tolerate weaning from the ventilator or if there is a new onset of infection.
2. Sepsis: There is a risk of sepsis recurrence if the source of infection is not completely eradicated or if the patient develops a new infection.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels need to be closely monitored to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Although the ARF is resolving, the patient remains oliguric (producing little urine) and requires careful monitoring of renal function.
5. Diabetes Management: The patient's diabetes management needs to be closely monitored to avoid hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease symptoms need to be managed to ensure comfort and prevent complications associated with immobility.
7. Pressure Ulcers: Due to the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with hx of diabetes, parkinsons, demetia who presents with
   bibasilar pneumona and sepsis.
   Sepsis/Pneumonia: Likely source is pulmonary.  He required intubation
   for agitation and ? aspiration during line placement.  His infection is
   complicated by severe dehydration and hypernatremia. Lactate initailly
   9.0 but responded to fluids and now in normal range. Urine legionella
   Ag Negative.  Currently on propofol for sedation which may be affecting
   his blood pressures.
   - IV Fluids to keep MAP>60, CVP>12, and UOP>30
   - Wean levaphed as tolerated
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   - continue vanc, levo, flagyl
   - wean vent settings as tolerated
   - AM CXR
   Respiratory Failure:  Patient intubed in the emergency room for
   agitation and concern for his airway.  Currently requiring minimal
   ventilatory support.  Will plan to wean propofol, perform SBT and
   consider extubation this morning.
   - wean propofol
   - SBT
   - RSBI
   - consider extubation this morning
    Hypernatremia: Patient was extremely dry on exam with initial Na of
   174 which came down with IV hydration.  Likely due to sepsis.
   Calculated free H2O deficit of ~8L.
   - Q6h Na checks
   - D5
 NS to correct Na by [**11-19**] tonight.
   - can transition to flushes down OG tube once more stable
   .
    ARF: FeNa of 1.8 after 6 L of NS suggesting he was pre-renal. Now
   resolved
   - monitor UOP and cr
   DM type II:  Arrived with glucoses in the 300 range likely [**12-20**] to
   sepsis.  Was on Metformin which may have compounded lactic acidosis.
   - hold metformin and glyburide
   - ISS
   Parkinsons: Was tremulous on presentation, but without significant
   rigidity.
   - continue sinemet down OGT
   Alzhemers Demetia: Unclear baseline mental status
   - continue aricept.
   Glaucoma: continue eye drops

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. He presented with bibasilar pneumonia and sepsis. The likely source of infection is pulmonary, and he required intubation for agitation and potential aspiration during line placement. His infection is complicated by severe dehydration and hypernatremia. The patient's initial lactate level was 9.0 but responded to fluids and is now within the normal range. Urine Legionella Ag negative. He was extubated and transitioned off pressors yesterday.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient had bibasilar pneumonia and required intubation due to agitation and potential aspiration. There is a risk of respiratory failure if proper respiratory support is not maintained.

2. Sepsis: The patient presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Proper management of infection and source control is essential to prevent further complications.

3. Dehydration: The patient has severe dehydration, as indicated by hypernatremia and dry mucous membranes on examination. Adequate fluid resuscitation is necessary to correct the dehydration and prevent further complications.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This can lead to neurological complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and dementia who presented with bilateral pneumonia and sepsis. He required intubation for agitation and possible aspiration during line placement. His infection is complicated by severe dehydration and hypernatremia. The patient's lactate initially measured 9.0 but responded to fluids and is now within the normal range. Urine Legionella Ag negative. He was extubated and transitioned off pressors yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient's initial sodium level was 174, which has come down with IV hydration. This suggests that the hypernatremia may be due to sepsis. Close monitoring of sodium levels is necessary, along with D5 NS to correct the sodium until symptoms can be evaluated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's initial FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium) was 1.8 after receiving 6 liters of normal saline, indicating pre-renal azotemia. However, it is now resolved, so monitoring urine output and creatinine levels is recommended.
3. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient arrived with glucose levels in the 300 range, likely exacerbated by sepsis. Metformin may have compounded lactic acidosis, so it should be held, and insulin gtt should be continued until glucose levels normalize.
4. Parkinson's Disease: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with hx of diabetes, parkinsons, demetia who presents with
   bibasilar pneumona and sepsis.
   Sepsis/Pneumonia: Likely source is pulmonary.  He required intubation
   for agitation and ? aspiration during line placement.  His infection is
   complicated by severe dehydration and hypernatremia. Lactate initailly
   9.0 but responded to fluids and now in normal range. Urine legionella
   Ag Negative.  Extubated and transitioned off pressors yesterday.
   - IV Fluids to keep MAP>60, CVP>12, and UOP>30
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cx
   - continue vanc, levofloxacin for hospital acquired pneumonia for 7 day
   course
   - will discontinue flagyl as low suspicion for anerobic infection
    Hypernatremia: Patient was extremely dry on exam with initial Na of
   174 which came down with IV hydration.  Likely due to sepsis.
   Calculated free H2O deficit of ~8L on presentation.  Has corrected well
   with D5
 NS.  Unable to participate with speech and swallow.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Na checks
   - D5
 NS @ 150 cc/hr to correct Na until S&S can  eval
   - Failed swallow eval again today
   - will reattempt NGT today with ativan
    ARF: FeNa of 1.8 after 6 L of NS suggesting he was pre-renal. Now
   resolved
   - monitor UOP and cr
   DM type II:  Arrived with glucoses in the 300 range likely [**12-20**] to
   sepsis.  Was on Metformin which may have compounded lactic acidosis.
   He was put on insulin gtt and transitioned back to sub Q insulin when
   Glucose was normalized
   - hold metformin and glyburide
   - ISS
   Parkinsons: Was tremulous on presentation, but without significant
   rigidity.
   - will restart sinemet when able to place NGT
   - In setting of parkinsons, can only use seroquel or clozaril for
   agitation which are both PO meds
   Alzhemers Demetia: Unclear baseline mental status
   - continue aricept when taking POs.
   Glaucoma: continue eye drops

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and dementia who presented with bilateral pneumonia and sepsis. He required intubation for agitation and possible aspiration during line placement. The likely source of infection is pulmonary, and his infection is complicated by severe dehydration and hypernatremia. The patient's initial lactate level was high but responded to fluids and is now within normal range. Urine Legionella Ag was negative. The patient was transitioned off pressors and extubated yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient is currently on a 7-day course of vancomycin and levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or recurrence of infection due to improper antibiotic choice or inadequate treatment duration.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to sepsis and dehydration. Close monitoring of sodium levels is necessary, and IV fluids should be administered carefully to avoid further electrolyte imbalances.
3. Aspiration: The patient has difficulty with speech and swallow, and a bedside swallow trial was unsuccessful. There is a risk of aspiration pneumonia if the patient is unable to protect their airway.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient initially had a high FeNa indicating pre-renal acute renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary to assess kidney function.
5. Diabetic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. He presents with bilateral lower lobe pneumonia and septic shock. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and off pressors for 24 hours, showing improvement in urine output and central venous pressure, as well as normalization of lactate levels. The patient has hypernatremia and is receiving hypotonic fluid resuscitation with D5 1/2 NS, with serial sodium checks every six hours. Medications for diabetes management (metformin and glyburide) are being held, and the patient is receiving RISS for Parkinson's disease. Sinemet is being continued, and once nasogastric tube (NGT) access is obtained, Seroquel may be used for agitation. The patient failed a swallow study, necessitating some form of nutritional access. NGT placement will be attempted with a small dose of benzodiazepine if needed. Long-term nutrition options may need to be discussed. The patient is nil per os (NPO) due to failed swallow evaluations. A multi-lumen central venous catheter (CVC) has been placed, given the inability to obtain alternate access. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) for ventilator"

   Hypernatremia: continue hypotonic fluid resuscitation now w/ D5 1/2 NS
   and follow Na serially (q6 today)
   DM: continue holding metformin and glyburide, cont RISS
   Parkinsons: cont Sinemet
   -once NGT access obtained can use Seroquel for agitation
   Nutrition: failed swallow study, needs some access for nutrition
   -will attempt NGT placement with very small dose of benzo if needed (no
   more than 0.5mg Ativan) as Sinemet may
   -may need to discuss long-term nutrition

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and dementia who presented with bibasilar pneumonia and septic shock. He is currently hemodynamically stable and off pressors for 24 hours. His urine output and central venous pressure have improved, and his lactate levels have normalized. The patient requires continued antibiotic treatment for a total of 7 days, with vancomycin and levofloxacin being administered. He also needs hypotonic fluid resuscitation to address hypernatremia, with sodium levels to be followed serially every 6 hours.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock due to pneumonia. Although he is now hemodynamically stable, careful monitoring and continued antibiotic treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate hypernatremia. Hypotonic fluid resuscitation will help correct this electrolyte imbalance.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation included bibasilar pneumonia. It is essential to monitor his respiratory status and ensure appropriate antibiotic coverage.
4. Diabetes Management: The patient's diabetes management should continue with holding metformin and glyburide, and close monitoring of blood glucose levels.
5. Parkinson's Disease Management: The patient's Parkinson's disease management should continue with the administration of Sinemet.
6. Nutrition: Due to the failed swallow study, the"
