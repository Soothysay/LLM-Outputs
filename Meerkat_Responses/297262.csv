   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 56-year-old with a history of cirrhosis, hepC, autoimmune hepatitis, varices, nonocclusive portal vein thrombosis, breast cancer requiring mastectomy and radiation therapy, chronic renal insufficiency, and coronary artery disease.
- The patient was admitted with fevers, confusion, and started on CTX for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient also had vaginal bleeding requiring transfusion.
- The patient's mental status worsened again over the past few days and received 2 days of linezolid for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in urine.
- The patient developed vascular trauma leading to a hematoma following a right radial arterial blood gas (ABG).
- Currently, the patient is complaining of abdominal pain.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 168/72 mmHg to 197/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at room air.
- The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.7 g/dL, platelet count of 84 K/uL, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, glucose of 217 mg/dL, and other abnormalities.
- Imaging reveals a likely ileus without small bowel obstruction, and microbiology results indicate a urinary tract infection with VRE.
- The patient's assessment includes cirrhosis, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, potential need for liver transplant, continuation of lactulose and rifaximin, recent completion of antibiotics, planned paracentesis, and ongoing monitoring for various other conditions such as vaginal bleeding, blood loss anemia, UTI, CRI, HTN, hypernatremia, wrist hematoma, and DM.
- The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and current symptoms of confusion, there is a risk of worsening hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and other neurological complications.
2. Infection: The presence of VRE in the urine indicates a urinary tract infection, and the patient's overall condition may increase the risk of further infections such as SBP or pneumonia.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding, including vaginal bleeding and a hematoma from the radial ABG, suggests a risk of ongoing bleeding or hemorrhagic complications.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and the recent blood loss may contribute to renal insufficiency or acute kidney injury.
5. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's history of CAD and hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
6. Respiratory problems: The patient's respiratory rate and ABG results indicate a need for close monitoring of respiratory function, and the possibility of respiratory failure should be considered.
7. Wrist hematoma: The patient"

The patient is a 56-year-old with a history of cirrhosis, hepC, autoimmune hepatitis, varices, nonocclusive portal vein thrombosis, breast cancer, mastectomy, local recurrence requiring XRT, CRI, and CAD. They were admitted with fevers, confusion, and started on CTX for possible SBP, showing improvement. However, their mental status worsened again and they were restarted on vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by severe liver disease leading to the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream that affect brain function.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of infections such as SBP, UTI, and VRE in the urine. They have been on multiple antibiotics, indicating a risk of developing antibiotic-associated complications or acquiring new infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of vaginal bleeding suggest an increased risk of bleeding. They are receiving FFP and PRBCs as needed due to blood loss anemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of HCV and autoimmune hepatitis, admitted for low-grade fever and hepatic encephalopathy. She is on the transplant list and was transferred to the ICU for worsening encephalopathy. The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hypertension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, coagulopathy, and possible angioedema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure with an improved creatinine level but still shows signs of fluid overload and hypertension. This may require further intervention such as diuretics and renal consult.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy is worsening despite treatment with lactulose and rifaximin. Close monitoring and adjustment of medication doses may be necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension despite the discontinuation of midodrine. Alternative antihypertensive medications may need to be considered.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia and appears fluid overloaded. Diuretics and fluid restriction may be required to manage these imbalances.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a significantly elevated INR indicating coagulopathy secondary to decompensated liver failure. Vitamin K supplementation and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion may be necessary to correct the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old individual with Hepatitis C and autoimmune hepatitis who was admitted for low-grade fever and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status has been worsening, leading to a transfer from the floor to the ICU. The patient is currently on the liver/kidney transplant list.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered mental status - The patient's worsening mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and hypernatremia. Treatment includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin, repeating abdominal imaging, performing paracentesis, and administering Lasix for hypervolemic hypernatremia.

2. Coagulopathy - The patient has low-grade vaginal bleeding and oropharyngeal mucosal bleeding, indicating secondary coagulopathy due to decompensated liver failure. Vitamin K is being administered orally, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate will be given prior to procedures.

3. Acute on chronic kidney injury - The patient's creatinine level has increased, indicating an acute worsening of chronic kidney injury. Renal ultrasound shows no obstructive uropathy. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid overload, and the possibility of restarting midodrine if the patient becomes normotensive is being considered.

4. Hypertension - The patient has hypertension, which may be related to volume overload. Diuretics and hydralazine are"

","The patient is a 56-year-old with Hep C and autoimmune hepatitis on the liver/kidney transplant list. They were admitted for low-grade fever and hepatic encephalopathy, but are now experiencing worsening mental status. The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed.

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy has worsened over the past three days, characterized by disorientation and asterixis. Lactulose was increased to 60 mg po q3h, and it should be continued with titration to 4 bowel movements per day. Rifaximin should also be continued.

2. Fevers: Although the patient initially had a fever of 100.5 on admission, they have been afebrile during their hospital stay. Urine culture from October 5 showed growth of coag-negative staph and VRE, but subsequent cultures were negative. ID fellow recommended against treating this. The abdominal distension is likely due to ascites, given the KUB findings. No antibiotics for SBP are recommended for now, given the recent completion of ceftriaxone. A paracentesis under IR guidance is scheduled for the morning, and FFP should be given prior to the procedure to achieve an INR of less than 2.0. Follow-up culture data should be obtained, and cultures should be done if spikes occur.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old individual with Hepatitis C and autoimmune hepatitis who is on the liver/kidney transplant list. They were admitted for low-grade fever and hepatic encephalopathy but have now been transferred from the floor due to worsening mental status. The patient's medical history includes breast cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and right wrist hematoma. They are currently experiencing altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and hypernatremia. Other assessments include coagulopathy, acute on chronic kidney injury, hypertension, end-stage liver disease, and a history of compartment syndrome in the right wrist.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's worsening mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by severe liver dysfunction. It can lead to confusion, disorientation, and altered consciousness if not treated promptly.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels indicate hypernatremia, which can result from fluid overload and dehydration. This condition can lead to neurological complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has low platelet counts and prolonged clotting times, indicating coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding, especially since the patient is experiencing low-grade vaginal bleeding and oropharyngeal mucosal bleeding.
4. Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient's kidney function"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and autoimmune hepatitis, admitted for low-grade fever and hepatic encephalopathy. She is on the transplant list and transferred to the ICU for worsening encephalopathy. The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, hypertension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, coagulopathy, and a history of breast cancer. She also has hepatic encephalopathy, which is causing altered mental status and asterixis.

The patient's vital signs show high blood pressure, normal temperature, and normal respiratory rate. Her oxygen saturation is 98% without supplemental oxygen. She has a central venous line, and a right arm hematoma from arterial puncture.

Lab results indicate elevated creatinine, low platelet count, prolonged PT/INR, and abnormal liver function tests. Ultrasound findings include reverse flow in the portal veins and splenic vein, patent hepatic veins, large varices in the left upper quadrant, and a shrunken nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis.

The patient's treatment plan includes lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, NG access for possible SBP coverage, repeat blood cultures, and a diagnostic paracentesis to evaluate the ascites. She is also being managed for coagulopathy, acute on chronic kidney injury, hypertension, hypernatremia, and a right wrist hematoma.

   # Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury - Creatinine improved to 1.5 which is
   her baseline on midodrine/octreotide. Patient appears fluid overloaded,
   and is hypertensive. Midodrine was discontinued. Urine output minimal,
   but not well recorded. Holding albumin, given intermittent
   hypertension, volume overload.  Renal U/S from [**10-1**] negative for
   obstructive uropathy.
   - Hold midodrine, given hypertension. Consider restarting if
   normotensive.
   - continue octreotide
   - Restart diuresis. Puts out well to 20mg IV Lasix.
   -  f/u urine output. Consider renal consult in the future given
   possible need for CVVH.
   .
   # Hypertension: Systolic BPs between 160 and 200 on transfer. Patient
   currently denies any chest pain or headache. Patient appears fluid
   overloaded and is anuric. Holding midodrine given HTN.
   -consider hydral PRN systolic BP>160
   -continue diuresis with 20mg IV lasix

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of chronic renal failure, hepatitis C, and autoimmune hepatitis. She was admitted for low-grade fever and hepatic encephalopathy and is on the transplant list. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is disoriented and has asterixis, which is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose therapy has been increased and continued.

2. Right arm hematoma: The patient has a right arm hematoma due to arterial access attempted over the weekend. Sensation and strength in the hand are intact, and there are no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pseudo-aneurysm on ultrasound. Plastic surgery has been consulted.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a significantly elevated INR of 6.2, indicating severe liver dysfunction. She also has low platelets and is experiencing mild oropharyngeal bleeds from cracked lips. FFP transfusion is planned prior to paracentesis and CVL placement.

4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved to 1.5, which is her baseline while on midodrine/octreotide. She appears fluid overloaded and hypertensive. Midodrine has been discontinued, and albumin has been held due to intermittent hypertension. Lasix has been restarted at 20mg IV to promote diuresis.

5. Hypertension: The patient's systolic BPs have been consistently high, ranging from 160 to 200. Holding midodrine has been considered given hypertension. Diuresis with lasix has been continued.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have been elevated up to 153. Stable management with NS and D5W is planned.

7. Breast cancer: The patient is being treated with letrozole and has a history of left mastectomy. No IV draws from the left arm are being performed.

8. Other medical issues: The patient has occasional hypoglycemia, likely due to decreased glucose production in worsening liver failure. Diabetic diet and adjustments in insulin therapy have been recommended. The patient also has a history of autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis C.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy leading to bleeding, renal failure, hypertension, hypernatremia, and complications related to the breast cancer history. Close monitoring and management of these conditions are essential for the patient's well-being."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C and autoimmune hepatitis. She was admitted for low-grade fever and hepatic encephalopathy and is currently on the transplant list. The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Altered mental status - secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, which has been worsening over the past three days. The patient is disoriented and exhibits asterixis. She has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin.

2. Fevers - The patient was admitted with a fever of 100.5 on the day of admission, but has been afebrile during her hospital stay. Urine culture from October 5th grew coag-negative staph and VRE, which are thought to be colonizers/contaminants. Abdominal distension is likely due to ascites, as indicated by the KUB findings. Tender to palpation/percussion, but respiratory status is preserved. No antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) have been given, as the recent completion of ceftriaxone (three courses of antibiotics empirically for SBP). Paracentesis would be difficult, so it is being held off, with plans to follow up on culture data.

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with Hepatitis C and autoimmune hepatitis, admitted for low-grade fever and hepatic encephalopathy. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Altered mental status: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and hypernatremia. His mental status has been worsening over the last three days.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient is experiencing hypervolemic hypernatremia, likely due to fluid overload. Treatment includes fluid restriction, checking sodium levels, switching to D5W for IV fluids, and attempting diuresis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has secondary coagulopathy due to decompensated liver failure. He has experienced low-grade vaginal bleeding and oropharyngeal mucosal bleeding. Treatment includes daily PO Vitamin K, FFP prior to paracentesis and Dobhoff placement, active T&S, transfusion for HCT < 24, and continuation of epo.
4. Acute on chronic kidney injury: The patient has an acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease. A renal ultrasound showed no obstructive uropathy. Treatment includes holding midodrine due to hypertension and considering its restart if normotensive, continuing octreotide, and diuresis.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, possibly due to volume overload. Diuretics will be used to manage hypertension, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old individual with Hepatitis C and autoimmune hepatitis who is awaiting a liver transplant. The patient was admitted for low-grade fever and hepatic encephalopathy and has now been transferred from the floor due to worsening mental status.

The patient's current assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been worsening over the last three days. This could be attributed to likely hepatic encephalopathy and hypernatremia. The plan is to continue lactulose and rifaximin, follow up with blood and urine cultures, perform a paracentesis to rule out recurrent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and place a Dobhoff catheter for enteral intake and medication administration due to poor mental status.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypervolemic hypernatremia. The plan includes free water supplementation once the Dobhoff catheter is placed, sodium checks, switching to D5W for intravenous fluids, diuresis, and further evaluation.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy secondary to decompensated liver failure, as indicated by low-grade vaginal bleeding and oropharyngeal mucosal bleeding. The plan involves administering oral Vitamin K daily, providing fresh frozen plasma (FFP) today prior to paracentesis and Dobhoff placement, monitoring for any bleeding tendencies,"
