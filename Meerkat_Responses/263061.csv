   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and residence in a nursing home. The patient was found lethargic and brought to the emergency department (ED) where she was found to be hypotensive and had a Foley catheter placed that drained purulent material. The patient's labs showed leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and positive urine analysis for white blood cells (WBCs) and bacteria. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST depressions in anterior leads. The patient received intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and norepinephrine in the ED.

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient's condition improved, and the norepinephrine infusion was weaned down. Ciprofloxacin was added for extra gram-negative bacterial coverage. Repeat laboratory results showed improved kidney function, and the ECG also improved. The patient's son was contacted and provided full ICU consent and a code status of full code.

Overnight, the patient became more aware and responsive, especially when speaking to her son and the healthcare provider. At around 7 am, the patient became tachycardic while receiving a fluid bolus. 

The patient's vital signs and lab results are as follows:
- Blood pressure: 95/49 mmHg (61) to 158/98 mmHg
- Heart"

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into Afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine.
   .
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in PM.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Pressors: Norepi, titrate to MAP >60-65.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus; consider VRE coverage
   if no improvement.
   - Consider cortisol check or [**Last Name (un) **] stim.
   .
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in ECG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - VBG for pH.
   .
   FEN: bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for now.
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, H2B.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and a nursing home resident. She presented to the hospital with lethargy and was found to have septic shock likely of urinary origin and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been stable overnight but became hypotensive and developed atrial fibrillation after the restart of norepinephrine and half of a fluid bolus. Currently, she is back on pressors but now on phenylephrine.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Septic shock/UTI: The patient is presumed to have a urinary tract infection as the source of sepsis, with positive urine analysis and no evidence of pneumonia or other sources of infection. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending.

2. ARF on CKD: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This may be due to simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from ischemia. There is no reason for postobstructive process.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia due to the combination of ARF, K supplementation at the nursing home, and possibly the use of amiloride. Monitoring ECGs and considering renal involvement if the next K check is not improved.

4. Lethargy: The patient's leth"

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number
   of sedating meds which may be affected by renal failure.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for idea of baseline mental status.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and a nursing home resident. She presented with lethargy and was found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. UTI - Presumed responsible for the patient's presentation with altered mental status and hypotension. The patient has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had a positive urine analysis (UA), indicating a urinary tract infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin) have been started to cover urinary organisms.

2. ARF - The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. This could be due to prerenal causes (volume depletion/poor flow) or renal causes (acute tubular necrosis). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

3. Atrial Fibrillation - The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation. This may be related to fluid resuscitation and atrial distention. Rate control with metoprolol may be considered if tachycardia persists.

4. Lethargy and altered mental status - These symptoms are likely due to systemic illness"

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # Septic shock/UTI.  Presumed urinary source with clearly positive UA
   in [**Hospital1 **] patient. Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pneumonia.
   No recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
   - obtain collateral info from [**Hospital1 **] and PCP and family.
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - bloods
   pending, CXR without clear pneumonia; abdomen seems tender though
   denies pain; could consider imaging if not improving.
   - Maintain CVPs 8-12.
   - Continue phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with Goal MAPs > 65.
   - Repeat lactate in today.
   - Monitor central venous sats with sepsis cath or labs, consider
   inotropes if < 70.
   - Antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with double GNR coverage
   - cefepime and cipro plus vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.
   Was taking K supplements at [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely this represents some degree
   of acute insufficiency.  Simple prerenal from volume depletion/poor
   flow vs. ATN from ischemia most likely.  No reason for postobstructive
   process.
   - Consider renal US if no improvment on PM labs.
   - baseline creatinine.
   - Check urine lytes.
   - Repeat lytes this PM.
   - Management of hyperkalemia as below.
   - Avoid hypotension; bolus prn to maintain CVPs.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.  Combination of ARF, K supplementation at [**Hospital1 **] in this
   setting, and [**Last Name (un) **] use.  No DKA or hyperosmolality present.
   - Monitor ECGs; Ca gluc prn K related changes.
   - Insulin and D50 for temporizing; expect total body K to improve with
   improvement in urine output.
   - Repeat lytes now.
   - Consider renal involvement if next K check not improved.
   .
   # Lethargy.  Likely due to systemic illness.  Nothing focal on exam to
   suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number of sedating meds which may
   be affected by renal failure.
   - Consider head CT.
   - Management of septic shock as above.
   - Hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.
   .
   # ECG changes.  ST depressions in EKG in ED but this tracing most
   likely affected by poor lead positioning leading to early R wave
   transition.  Now with ST depressions more likely related to
   hypertrophy/IVCD.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Supportive care.
   - Consider ASA/statin if more significant elevation.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  Likely related to renal failure, lactate only
   minimally elevated.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Aline today for pH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of dementia, COPD, and thyroid cancer, who was found lethargic and brought to the emergency department. She was hypotensive and hypoxic upon arrival. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and imaging were ordered. The patient was given antibiotics and fluids, but her condition worsened, leading to septic shock. She is currently on pressors and has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation. Other findings include acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and ECG changes. The patient's lethargy is likely due to systemic illness and renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/UTI: The patient's worsening condition and positive urine analysis suggest a urinary tract infection as the source of sepsis. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. It is important to maintain CVPs between 8-12, continue phenylephrine to maintain MAPs > 65, and monitor for signs of improvement or alternative sources.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate ARF. Possible causes include volume depletion/poor flow or ischemia. Consider renal US if no improvement on PM labs, baseline creatinine, urine lytes, and repeat lytes this PM.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's high potassium levels are likely due to ARF and K supplementation. Monitor ECGs and consider insulin"

   Imaging: Final Report
   HISTORY: 70-year-old female with right internal jugular PICC line
   placement.
   COMPARISON: Preprocedure radiograph from two hours earlier, dated
   [**2113-3-27**] at
   10:10 a.m.
   FINDINGS: Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right
   internal
   jugular venous catheter with tip in the mid right atrium. Evaluation is
   limited, given the low lung volumes and patient rotation, with crowding
   of
   bronchovascular markings. There is no gross evidence of pneumonia or
   CHF.
   The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable. Atherosclerotic
   calcification is noted along the aortic knob. The visualized osseous
   structures and soft tissues appear intact. Bibasilar atelectasis is
   present.
   Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: Right IJ catheter tip in the right atrium. Recommend
   retraction.

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with dementia, COPD, thyroid cancer, [**Hospital1 **] resident, presenting with
   lethargy and found to have septic shock, likely of urinary origin, and
   ARF.  Was stable and off pressors overnight.  This morning became
   hypotensive to SBP in 70s and went into afib after levophed restarted
   and half of 1L fluid bolus received.  Currently back on pressors, but
   now phenylephrine, and going in and out of afib.
   # UTI -  Presumed responsible for presentation with altered mental
   status, hypotension. Has tenderness to deep abdominal palpation and had
   positive UA and is a [**Hospital1 **] patient. Other items on differential are less
   likely: cardiac enzymes negative, no physical or imaging evidence of
   pneumonia, no recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest
   C.diff.
   - place a-line today for better pressure monitoring.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   - consider alternative sources if no improvement evaluation - abdomen
   seems tender though denies pain; could consider imaging if not
   improving.
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=67->53->41
   Cr=3.9->3.0->2.2.  Has noted CKD per [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not
   clear.  Likely prerenal from volume depletion/poor flow and some
   component of ATN from ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating
   well.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for baseline BUN and Cr.
   - check urine lytes to determine prerenal vs renal cause of ARF.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 Patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going in and
   out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial distention
   from fluid resuscitation.
   - check with [**Hospital1 **] for history of afib
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   .
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Likely due to systemic illness.
   Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Also on a number
   of sedating meds which may be affected by renal failure.
   - contact [**Name (NI) **] for idea of baseline mental status.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - hold depakote, risperdone (partially renally cleared), wellbutrin,
   trazodone for now.  Check valproate level.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, COPD, and residence in a nursing home. She was found lethargic and brought to the emergency department. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for septic shock, likely of urinary origin. She also has acute renal failure. 

The patient's current vitals include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Initial labs show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15,000 cells/microliter, elevated creatinine levels, and positive urine analysis for white blood cells and bacteria. An ECG shows ST depressions in the anterior leads. 

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover urinary organisms, including ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. She is also receiving vasopressor support with phenylephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure. 

Renal function is being monitored, and the patient is producing urine well, suggesting that the renal failure is not postrenal in nature. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may be exacerbated by fluid resuscitation. 

The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due"

   Assessment and Plan
 SHOCK, SEPTIC:  Now back on pressors.  Likely urinary tract source.
   Preliminary culture growing alpha hemolytic lactobacillus (latter
   likely contaminant).   Continue current broad spectrum antibiotics. WBC
   decreasing, lactate trending down.  Still hemodynamically unstable
   albeit afib likely contributing.  Enzymes trending down, no evident
   acute cardiac component.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Likely contributing to earlier drop in blood
   pressure.  Now in sinus rhythm, autoconverted following fluid bolus.
   Check echo.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  More awake and alert this am.
 ANEMIA:  Hct drop likely dilutional given aggressive volume
   resusitation overnight.  Need to follow serial CBCs.  Guaiac stools.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC
   KIDNEY DISEASE):  Likely component of prerenal vs. ATN in setting of
   sepsis and hypotension.  She does have persistent eos in UA, may have
   component of interstitial nephritis.  Will review med list and stop any
   that may be potentially contributing.  Cr trending down, now 2.2.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of urosepsis. The patient's health progress in the ICU is as follows:
- The patient experienced multi-lumen and nasal swab MRSA.
- The patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70s and required a 1 L NS bolus and restart of pressors.
- The patient developed atrial fibrillation during hypotension and is now in sinus rhythm.
- The patient has allergies to alprazolam and acetaminophen.
- The patient received ciprofloxacin antibiotics.
- The patient is on phenylephrine infusion, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.
- The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged except for certain noted changes.
- The patient is receiving nutritional support through a Foley catheter and is NPO.
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension.
- The patient's flow sheet data indicates fluid balance and hemodynamic monitoring.
- The patient's physical examination reveals overweight/obesity, dry mucus membranes, diminished peripheral pulses, and cool skin.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, and potassium levels.
- The patient's microbiology results indicate a urinary catheter-related infection with alpha-hemolytic"

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off
   pressors. Echo showed no strep viridans vegs.
   - follow blood cultures
   - ID consult today because strep viridans is an unusual UTI bug.
   - discontinue ciprofloxacin and vanc.  Continue ceftriaxone.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - discontinue a line today
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - only need daily lytes to trend BUN and CR, since we are not using

 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   - restart home nefedipine given good blood pressure.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.
   - management of septic shock as above.
   - can restart depakote, risperdone, wellbutrin, trazodone.
   # Anemia
 pt having HCT drop since admission.  Today 25.3 from 29.5
   yesterday.  No signs or suspicion of bleeding.  Guiac negative
   yesterday.
   - continue to trend with afternoon HCT
   # COPD
 pt has history of COPD and is wheezing on exam
   - restart home tiotropium (spiriva) and ipratropium/albuterol
   (combivent)

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was found lethargic and hypoxic at Hospital1 and brought to Hospital2. He had leukocytosis and a positive urine culture, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI) with streptococcus viridans. He was started on norepinephrine and antibiotics and transferred to the ICU. His mental status has improved, and he is now off pressors with stable blood pressure. The echocardiogram showed no vegetations. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with altered mental status, hypotension, and leukocytosis, which are consistent with sepsis. Strep viridans in the urine suggests a UTI as the source of infection.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has been noted to have an elevated baseline creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level. The etiology of AKI is likely pre-renal from volume depletion and some component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from ischemia.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient experienced an episode of AFib on 03/28, possibly caused by atrial distention from fluid resuscitation. 
4. Anemia: The patient's hematoc"

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.

   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was found lethargic and hypoxic at [Hospital1] and was brought to [Hospital2]. There, he was found to have leukocytosis and positive urine analysis, so he was started on norepinephrine and antibiotics and transferred to the ICU at [Hospital3]. Now, his mental status is improving, and he is off pressors with stable blood pressure. Strep viridans is growing from his urine culture. His leukocytosis is resolving, and his creatinine level is decreasing. His hematocrit continues to fall.

24-hour events include the placement of an arterial line, which initially showed a blood pressure in the 140s but required discontinuation of pressors due to a drop in pressure to the 80s. He received intravenous fluids and his central venous pressure (CVP) improved from 2 to 6. A consult with the infectious disease department was requested for further evaluation of possible sources of strep viridans.

Allergies: The patient has allergies to alprazolam and acetaminophen.

Medications: The patient has received ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin.

Infusions: The patient is receiving heparin sodium"

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2113-3-28**] 10:42 AM
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2113-3-28**] 02:45 PM
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was found lethargic and hypoxic at Hospital 1 and transferred to Hospital 2. He is currently in the ICU with improving mental status, off pressors with stable blood pressure, and positive urine culture for streptococci viridans. His leukocytosis is resolving, creatinine is decreasing, and hematocrit is falling. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's positive urine culture for streptococci viridans indicates a possible infection. This can lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's recent decrease in urine output and rising creatinine levels suggest the possibility of AKI. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, dehydration, or medication side effects.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD increases the risk of respiratory failure. This can occur if the patient's lungs are unable to provide enough oxygenation or remove enough carbon dioxide.

4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and the findings from the echocardiogram"

   found in [**Hospital1 **] lethargic and hypoxic.  Brought to [**Hospital1 5**] and found to have
   leukocytosis and positive UA, so started on norepinephrine and
   antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**].  Now with improving mental status,
   off pressors with stable pressure, with strep viridans growing from
   urine culture.  Leukocytosis resolving to 8.3 today. Cr resolving to
   1.5 today. HCT continuing to fall to 25.3 today.
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2113-3-28**] 10:42 AM
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2113-3-28**] 02:45 PM
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2113-3-28**] 04:14 PM
   [**3-28**]
   - Arterial line placed at 1630, BP 140s so pressors d/c'd but then
   pressure dropped to 80s. CVP 2. gave IVF 1L
   - S&s oredered
   - Gave vit k 5mg x 3 days
   - BP still low when sleeping 80s, but came up when woken up. CVP 6
   after 1L so gave another slowly
   - Curbside consult with ID: case would be a good ID consult for this
   morning.  Several possible sources of strep viridans that they could
   look into.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Septic shock
 UTI presumed responsible for presentation with altered
   mental status, hypotension, leukocytosis.  Urine growing strep
   viridans. Other items on differential are less likely: cardiac enzymes
   and echo negative, no physical or imaging evidence of pneumonia, no
   recent antibiotics per med sheets or diarrhea to suggest C.diff.
   Pt now with stable pressures per arterial line and off pressors.
   - monitor CVP with RIJ and keep between [**9-14**] with fluids.
   - with CVP in range, use phenylephrine (alpha 1 only) with goal MAPs >
   65.
   - repeat lactate today.
   - antibiotics: Broadly cover urinary organisms with ceftriaxone and
   cipro for GNR and vanc for enterococcus;
   # ARF on CKD
 BUN and Cr falling with BUN=23 Cr=1.5  Has noted CKD per
   [**Hospital1 **] notes though baseline not clear.  Etiology of ARF likely prerenal
   from volume depletion/poor flow and some component of ATN from
   ischemia.  Likely not postrenal because urinating well.
   - obtain pm lytes today to trend BUN and CR.
   # AFib
 On [**3-28**] patient became hypotensive to SBP of 70s and was going
   in and out of afib on morning of [**3-28**].  Possibly caused by atrial
   distention from fluid resuscitation.  Pt has been in sinus since.  No
   history of Afib from nursing home notes.
   - maintain MAPs with fluid and phenylephrine, then consider rate
   control with metoprolol if tachycardia persists.
   # Lethargy and altered mental status.  Patient A&Ox3 today with mental
   status remarkably improved from presentation. Likely due to systemic
   illness.  Nothing focal on exam to suggest focal CNS process.  Pt was
   also on a number of sedating meds which may be affected by renal
   failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of dementia, bipolar disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was found lethargic and hypoxic at [**Hospital1**], brought to [**Hospital1 5**], and then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]. The patient has leukocytosis and a positive urine culture for streptococcus viridans. He was started on norepinephrine and antibiotics. His mental status is improving, and he is off pressors with stable blood pressure. His laboratory values show resolving leukocytosis and creatinine levels. The patient's chest X-ray from [**8-25**] indicates mild dilation of the left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect, and the ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but there is no aortic stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, and there is trivial mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is present, and there is no pericardial effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient presented with altered mental status, hypotension, and leukocytosis."

   afternoon, hypotensive episode last night with low CVP, responsive to
   IVF challenge.  Urine growing stres viridans.  Blood cultures no growth
   to date.  WBC normal.  TTE did not show vegetations.  ID service to
   consult given this is an unusual bacteria in this setting.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Improved with treatment of
   infection.
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE):  Secondary to sepsis, hypotension, probable component of
   ATN.  Cr continues to trend down..  Good urine output.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension and urosepsis. The patient's main medical concerns include shock, septic vs. hypovolemia, altered mental status, renal failure, and anemia.

The patient experienced an episode of low blood pressure in the 80s, which was responsive to intravenous fluid bolus and arterial line placement. Urine cultures are growing stress viridans, while blood cultures show no growth to date. The trans-thoracic echo did not show any vegetations. 

The patient's altered mental status has improved with the treatment of the infection. She also has chronic renal failure, which is secondary to sepsis, hypotension, and acute tubular necrosis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased to 8.4 g/dL, likely due to dilutional anemia. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving multi-lumen lines, arterial line, and nutrition support. Glycemic control is being monitored, and prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are in place. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include worsening sepsis leading to septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, development of blood clots due to immob"
