   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, p/w A. Fib with
   RVR, and bacteremia.
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR.  Unclear if patient has h/o A. Fib in
   past but given mildly dilated atria on echo is certainly likely he has
   h/o A. Fib.  Would consider it new onset and work-up possible causes
   such as MI, chronic HTN, hyperthyroidism.
   - Recommend interrogate pacer to eval for timing of onset of A. Fib.
   - rate control with diltiazem gtt, transition to PO in AM.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Echo in AM.
   - Consider adding metoprolol IV/PO for additional rate control.
   - Not great candidate for anticoagulation given Fe deficiency anemia,
   colon cancer, and h/o transfusion dependence.  Would consult cards for
   possible TEE/cardioversion.
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Lactate mildly elevated, no WBC
   count on presentation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history
   and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain bacteremia and
   new A. Fib with RVR.  PE is a reasonable consideration in this setting
   but V/Q low probability.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**]
   to a. fib with RVR causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider
   aspiration.
   - BNP
   - Echo
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   - sputum culture, wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Hemodynamics:/Volume: Total body volume overload, but likely
   intravascularly depleted.  Patient appears underresuscitated at this
   time.  Will bolus LR for now.  Follow volume status closely.
   - check albumin, consider UE Ultrasound for DVT, LE assymetry likely
   chronic [**2-7**] SVG from CABG.
   - LR given non-gap metabolic acidosis
   - lasix PRN for respiratory distress (on RA 94-97% now)
   - hold lasix
   - restart metoprolol in AM.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  high grade bactermia by cultures, concerning for
   endocarditis, septic arthritis, pneumonia.  Patient with no localizing
   tenderness on exam, and with multiple areas of chronic bursitis.
   - Echo for veggies
   - surveillance cultures
   - vanco/zosyn given residence in nursing home and GPC bacteremia.
   - consider joint tap of right elbow if fever/bacteremia persists, but
   at this time joint exam is not c/w septic arthritis.
   - ESR/CRP
   .
   # ARF: Potentially pre-renal, previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**]
   [**Location (un) 78**], check Ua to ensure no active sediment.
   - check Ua, Urine lytes
   - Volume resuscitate, unlikely pre-renal from CHF exacerbation but
   anticipate that controlling A. Fib will assist with forward flow and
   renal perfusion.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely fe deficiency from colon cancer.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Bursitis/Gout: ?septic joint, most changes appear chronic, no clear
   source for infection.
   - Pulse steroids
   - consult rheum in AM.
   - check ESR/CRP
   - renally dose home meds
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  Will check A1c given
   hyperglycemia.  Cover with humalog sliding scale q6h for now.
   - f/u A1c
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now.

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with a rapid ventricular response and bacteremia. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been experiencing tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, fever, and bacteremia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 106/45 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on a face tent. The patient is also experiencing mild diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary edema.

The patient's physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, diminished radial pulses, and effusion in the elbows and knees. His abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. He has edema in his extremities and soft tissue prominence over his right knee. The patient is oriented and follows simple commands but has not been assessed for movement, tone, or skin examination.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, elevated troponin T, and abnormal kidney function. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues. Firstly, the patient's tachycardia is attributed to atrial fibrillation with rapid vent"

   [**2174-3-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-9**], there is
   again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with ICD
   device extending to the apex of the cardiac silhouette in a patient
   with ICD device extending to the apex of the right ventricle. The
   opacification in the retrocardiac region has somewhat increased. This
   could reflect atelectasis, though the possibility of a supervening
   pneumonia cannot be excluded. Some indistinctness of vessels raises the
   possibility of increasing pulmonary venous pressure. Intact midline
   sternal sutures remain in place.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently
   diagnosed colon cancer who presents with A. Fib with RVR and
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from OSH became positive quickly.
   Source unclear currently.  Not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  Another possibility is bacteremia secondary to
   Strep bovis given recent diagnosis of colon cancer.  ESR and CRP are
   elevated.
   - PA and LAT CXR today to assess for retrocardiac opacity
   - TTE to assess for vegetation
   - surveillance cultures
   - vanco/zosyn given residence in nursing home and GPC bacteremia.
   - consider joint tap of right elbow if fever/bacteremia persists, but
   at this time joint exam is not c/w septic arthritis.
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Will ask EP to interrogate ICD to determine how recent in
   onset this problem is.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is unlikely to be a candidate for
   coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer, but if afib new in
   onset, may be a candidate for cardioversion.  Patient has ruled out for
   an MI.
   - transition from diltiazem gtt to home regimen of PO metoprolol
   - Recommend interrogate pacer to eval for timing of onset of A. Fib.
   - Consider cards c/s for TEE and cardioversion
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower now
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  PE is a reasonable consideration
   in this setting but V/Q low probability.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. The patient presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A. Fib with RVR) and bacteremia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/45 mmHg to 155/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on face tent with 35% O2 delivery.

The patient has an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray, which could be due to the presence of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) device. There is also opacification in the retrocardiac region, which may indicate atelectasis or a possible pneumonia. The possibility of increasing pulmonary venous pressure is also raised.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Fever/bacteremia: The patient has an elevated temperature and positive blood cultures, suggesting an infection. The source of the infection is unclear, but it could be related to recent colon cancer or another source. Surveillance cultures and vancomycin/zeosyn antibiotics have been initiated.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male admit from [**Hospital 78**] Campus of [**Hospital1 1**] where he was admitted
   following AICD firing x4.  At [**Location (un) **] patient found to have significant
   fever and was given Vanco/CTX/Zosyn/Azithro and was then transferred to
   [**Hospital1 1**] for further evaluation of possible PE based upon [**Last Name (un) 4546**] clinical
   suspicion.  V/Q has been read as low probability which is reassuring.
   He has initial blood culture results returning positive and in the
   setting of recent diagnosis of colon CA certainly gut flora
   translocation is a leading source for presentation with
   fevers/chills/blood culture positive.
   Following arrival--patient with Diltiazem required for control of A-Fib
   with RVR following initial presentation with sinus rhythm.
   1)Sepsis
Likley GPC from gut source with dissemination.  He has no
   clear murmur on my exam this morning but has newly evolved A-Fib and
   does have what looks like moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and
   elevated BNP.
   -ECHO
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -Follow joint exam but unlikely to be septic foci
no erythema but does
   have fluid
   -Follow up culture results
   2)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Lopressor restart
   -Hold any anticoagulation as colon CA and risk of bleeding significant
   -AICD firing was likely related to A-fib and RVR by report
   -Would favor TEE prior to cardioversion
   3) CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITHOUT ACUTE EXACERBATION-
   -Continue prednisone dosing for Gout but may be associated benefit.
   -Continue with nebs
   -Move to negative fluid balance as possible
   -Would favor lateral film to evaluate possible retrocardiac opacity
   4)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Check FeNa
   -Hope to be able to move to diuresis when function stabilized
   5)Gout-
   -Rheum consult
   6)Colon CA-
   -Will have to defer any further staging eval for the moment but return
   to priority when stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation. He has a history of colon cancer and was previously admitted to another hospital for an AICD firing. The patient presented with significant fever and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Upon transfer to the current hospital, a V/Q scan was performed, which showed a low probability of pulmonary embolism. The patient's blood cultures were positive, indicating sepsis likely caused by gut flora due to gut flora translocation. He required Diltiazem to control his A-fib with rapid ventricular response following initial presentation with sinus rhythm. The patient also has moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and elevated BNP levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture, indicating an ongoing infection. Given his history of colon cancer, there is a high risk of gut flora translocation leading to sepsis. Immediate treatment is required with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has newly evolved A-fib, which can lead to irregular heart rhythm and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure. It is important to control the heart rate and consider anticoagulation therapy, but due to the patient's history of colon cancer and risk of bleeding, caution should be exercised.
3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COP"

   PA & LAT CXR [**2174-3-10**]: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
   there is little interval change. The lateral view is suboptimal and
   adds little to the characterization of the left basilar opacification,
   which most likely represents atelectasis.
   TTE [**2174-3-10**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
   moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
   inferior, inferolateral and lateral hypokinesis. The remaining segments
   contract normally (LVEF = 30-35%). Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
   sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
   the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on
   the mitral valve. An eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of moderate
   (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen ([**Last Name (un) **] 0.2 cm2, regurgitant volume 26
   ml/beat). The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
   increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Moderate regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate
   mitral regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2165-3-13**], left ventricular systolic function has
   deteriorated. Mitral and aortic regurgitation severity has increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently
   diagnosed colon cancer who presents with A. Fib with RVR and
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is rapidly rising and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.
   - [**Location (un) 1163**] to assess for vegetations
   - surveillance cultures
   - d2 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**])
   - bronchoscopy to further assess for ?pneumonia
   - consider restarting zosyn given sputum contains GNRs
   - pretreat for possible CT torso in the next day or two
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient has demonstrable septic arthritis in
   right wrist and left knee in addition to gouty arthritis.  Other joints
   may be affected as well.  Patient likely needs washout of most affected
   joints.  Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - will tap left olecranon bursa and consider tapping additional joints.
   - stopping colchicine giving rising creatinine
   - decrease prednisone to 10 mg given septic arthritis and prior taper
   (though pt. may need stress dose steroids)
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower after
   fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history
   and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain bacteremia and
   new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for PE.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing
   pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Will electively
   intubate patient today to perform bronchoscopy, [**Month/Day (2) 1163**], cardioversion,
   line placement, and possible joint washouts.
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   - sputum culture, wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On amnio per EP recs.  Appreciate assistance
   from EP.
   - [**Month/Day (2) 1163**] and likely cardioversion today
   .
   # ARF: Likely pre-renal as patient appeared underresuscitated on
   presentation.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. I/Os
   documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in the
   ICU, so technically only 570 cc in since arrival here.  No evidence of
   UTI currently.
   - check UA, Urine lytes
   - Anticipate that controlling A. Fib will help
   - renally dose meds
   - 1L D5NaHCO3 for fluid as well as pre-treatment for CT torso.
   .
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely fe deficiency from colon cancer.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Will cover with
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, outpatient PPI for GERD
   .
   # Access: peripherals x2; will place A-line and central line today

Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] are growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The source of infection is unclear. The patient also has septic arthritis in the right wrist and left knee, as well as gouty arthritis. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. There is evidence of pre-renal azotemia, likely due to under-resuscitation. 

The patient has tachypnea and hypoxemia, possibly secondary to a subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although pneumonia cannot be definitively ruled out. A urinary Legionella antigen test is negative, and a V/Q scan shows a low probability for pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient's tachycardia is attributed to new-onset atrial fibrillation. It appears to be a recent diagnosis for this patient and is unlikely related to an acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently
   diagnosed colon cancer who presents with A. Fib with RVR and
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from OSH became positive quickly.
   Source unclear currently.  Not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  Another possibility is bacteremia secondary to
   Strep bovis given recent diagnosis of colon cancer.  ESR and CRP are
   elevated.
   - PA and LAT CXR today to assess for retrocardiac opacity
   - TTE to assess for vegetation
   - surveillance cultures
   - vanco/zosyn given residence in nursing home and GPC bacteremia.
   - consider joint tap of right elbow if fever/bacteremia persists, but
   at this time joint exam is not c/w septic arthritis.
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Will ask EP to interrogate ICD to determine how recent in
   onset this problem is.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is unlikely to be a candidate for
   coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer, but if afib new in
   onset, may be a candidate for cardioversion.  Patient has ruled out for
   an MI.
   - transition from diltiazem gtt to home regimen of PO metoprolol
   - Recommend interrogate pacer to eval for timing of onset of A. Fib.
   - Consider cards c/s for [**Name2 (NI) 1163**] and cardioversion
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower now
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  PE is a reasonable consideration
   in this setting but V/Q low probability.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic
   dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly
   would consider aspiration.
   - ECHO
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   - sputum culture, wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Hemodynamics/Volume: Patient appeared underresuscitated on
   presentation, but adequately resuscitated currently.
   - check albumin, consider UE Ultrasound for DVT, LE assymetry likely
   chronic [**2-7**] SVG from CABG.
   - consider lasix today to mobilize excess fluid off
   .
   # ARF: Likely pre-renal, previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**],
   check Ua to ensure no active sediment.
   - check Ua, Urine lytes
   - Anticipate that controlling A. Fib and low dose lasix will assist
   with forward flow and renal perfusion.
   - renally dose home meds
   .
   # Bursitis/Gout: ?septic joint, most changes appear chronic, no clear
   source for infection.  ESR and CRP markedly elevated.
   - Pulse steroids
   - consult rheum.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely fe deficiency from colon cancer.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  Will check A1c given
   hyperglycemia.  Cover with humalog sliding scale q6h for now.
   - f/u A1c
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, outpatient PPI for GERD

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A. Fib with RVR) and bacteremia.
- Blood cultures from OSH became positive quickly, indicating a potential source of infection, but it is unclear at this time.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer.
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/47 to 137/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on face tent.
- The patient has elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with elevated levels of lactate, creatinine, glucose, and troponin-T.
- The patient's physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, tachycardia, scattered rhonchi in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and effusions in the right elbow and left knee.
- The patient's neurological examination shows attentive behavior and the ability to follow simple commands.
- The patient's recent lab results indicate elevated ESR and CRP levels.
- The patient's imaging studies show no vegetations on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) and little interval"

   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from OSH became positive quickly.
   Source unclear currently.  Not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  Another possibility is bacteremia secondary to
   Strep bovis given recent diagnosis of colon cancer.  ESR and CRP are
   elevated.
   - PA and LAT CXR today to assess for retrocardiac opacity
   - TTE to assess for vegetation
   - surveillance cultures
   - vanco/zosyn given residence in nursing home and GPC bacteremia.
   - consider joint tap of right elbow if fever/bacteremia persists, but
   at this time joint exam is not c/w septic arthritis.
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Will ask EP to interrogate ICD to determine how recent in
   onset this problem is.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is unlikely to be a candidate for
   coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer, but if afib new in
   onset, may be a candidate for cardioversion.  Patient has ruled out for
   an MI.
   - transition from diltiazem gtt to home regimen of PO metoprolol
   - Recommend interrogate pacer to eval for timing of onset of A. Fib.
   - Consider cards c/s for [**Name2 (NI) 1163**] and cardioversion
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower now
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  PE is a reasonable consideration
   in this setting but V/Q low probability.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic
   dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly
   would consider aspiration.
   - ECHO
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   - sputum culture, wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Hemodynamics/Volume: Patient appeared underresuscitated on
   presentation, but adequately resuscitated currently.
   - check albumin, consider UE Ultrasound for DVT, LE assymetry likely
   chronic [**2-7**] SVG from CABG.
   - consider lasix today to mobilize excess fluid off
   .
   # ARF: Likely pre-renal, previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**],
   check Ua to ensure no active sediment.
   - check Ua, Urine lytes
   - Anticipate that controlling A. Fib and low dose lasix will assist
   with forward flow and renal perfusion.
   - renally dose home meds
   .
   # Bursitis/Gout: ?septic joint, most changes appear chronic, no clear
   source for infection.  ESR and CRP markedly elevated.
   - Pulse steroids
   - consult rheum.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely fe deficiency from colon cancer.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns

   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  Will check A1c given
   hyperglycemia.  Cover with humalog sliding scale q6h for now.
   - f/u A1c

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently
   diagnosed colon cancer who presents with A. Fib with RVR and
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is rapidly rising and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Will defer bronchoscopy at present as
   patient has minimal secretions while intubated and no significant
   respiratory symptoms prior to intubation.  TEE yesterday was negative
   for vegetations on the valves and pacer lead.
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - d3 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**])
   - pretreat with NaHCO3 for possible CT torso in the next day or two
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient has demonstrable septic arthritis in
   right wrist and left knee in addition to gouty arthritis.  Other joints
   may be affected as well.  No fluid could be aspirated from the left
   olecranon bursa.  Rheumatology removed pus from right wrist and turbid
   fluid from both knees yesterday.  Right wrist and left knee appear to
   be the most affected joints and likely need washout.  Assistance and
   recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - stopping colchicine giving rising creatinine
   - solumedrol 16 mg daily per rheum for gout; needs slow taper
   - ortho to take to OR for washout later today
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower after
   fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history
   and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain bacteremia and
   new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for PE.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing
   pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient electively
   intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Will keep intubated
   as patient is going to OR today.  Will discuss with ortho whether
   additional washout is planned in near future and patient should remain
   intubated.
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   - sputum culture, wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # ARF: Likely pre-renal as patient appeared underresuscitated on
   presentation.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS I/Os
   documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in the
   ICU.  Patient had some low urine output overnight and was bolused 1L
   once.  Bolused another 1L NS this am.  No evidence of UTI currently.
   Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal etiology
   - Renal ultrasound to assess for intrinsic renal disease, abscess in
   the setting of bacteremia
   - renally dose meds (decrease nafcillin to 2 g Q6H if creatinine >
   4.0)
   - D5NaHCO3 at 75 cc/hr for maintenance fluid as well as pre-treatment
   for CT torso.
   - additional NS boluses prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte
   correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely fe deficiency from colon cancer.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Will cover with
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now as going for surgery; will
   need to start tube feeds within the next day or two.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. The patient presents with atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and bacteremia.

The patient has been experiencing fever, bacteremia, and septic arthritis in the right wrist and left knee. The source of bacteremia is unclear, and there is no convincing evidence of pneumonia. However, it cannot be definitely ruled out. The patient's elevated ESR and CRP levels, along with septic joints, suggest an ongoing infection.

The patient also has hyperglycemia, anemia (likely iron deficiency from colon cancer), and pressure ulcers. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to an elective procedure and subsequent respiratory distress.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the patient's recent diagnosis of colon cancer raises concerns for possible metastasis or spread of the cancer.

Other potential complications may include further kidney injury due to the use of contrast for imaging studies, as well as the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers from the underlying illnesses and medications.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition present multiple potential complications that need careful monitoring and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently
   diagnosed colon cancer who presents with A. Fib with RVR and
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is rapidly rising and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.
   - TEE to assess for vegetations
   - surveillance cultures
   - d2 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**])
   - bronchoscopy to further assess for ?pneumonia
   - consider restarting zosyn given sputum contains GNRs
   - pretreat for possible CT torso in the next day or two
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient has demonstrable septic arthritis in
   right wrist and left knee in addition to gouty arthritis.  Other joints
   may be affected as well.  Patient likely needs washout of most affected
   joints.  Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - will tap left olecranon bursa and consider tapping additional joints.
   - stopping colchicine giving rising creatinine
   - decrease prednisone to 10 mg given septic arthritis and prior taper
   (though pt. may need stress dose steroids)
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower after
   fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history
   and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain bacteremia and
   new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for PE.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing
   pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Will electively
   intubate patient today to perform bronchoscopy, TEE, cardioversion,
   line placement, and possible joint washouts.
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   - sputum culture, wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On amnio per EP recs.  Appreciate assistance
   from EP.
   - TEE and likely cardioversion today
   .
   # ARF: Likely pre-renal as patient appeared underresuscitated on
   presentation.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. I/Os
   documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in the
   ICU, so technically only 570 cc in since arrival here.  No evidence of
   UTI currently.
   - check UA, Urine lytes
   - Anticipate that controlling A. Fib will help
   - renally dose meds
   - 1L D5NaHCO3 for fluid as well as pre-treatment for CT torso.
   .
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely fe deficiency from colon cancer.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Will cover with
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, outpatient PPI for GERD
   .
   # Access: peripherals x2; will place A-line and central line today

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer.
- The patient presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and bacteremia.
- Blood cultures revealed growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The source of infection is unclear, and the patient also has septic arthritis in the right wrist and left knee, as well as gouty arthritis.
- The patient's creatinine levels are rapidly rising, which may preclude the use of contrast for a CT torso to further assess for potential pneumonia.
- The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, but this does not fully explain the bacteremia and new-onset atrial fibrillation with RVR.
- The patient has anemia, likely due to iron deficiency from colon cancer.
- The patient has hyperglycemia, with a recent HbA1c of 6.7. Insulin coverage is being provided.
- The patient has a history of glaucoma and pressure ulcers.
- The patient's electrolytes are replete, and they are currently NPO (nothing by mouth).
- The patient has peripheral lines placed, and central"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently
   diagnosed colon cancer who presents with A. Fib with RVR and
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is rapidly rising and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Will defer bronchoscopy at present as
   patient has minimal secretions while intubated and no significant
   respiratory symptoms prior to intubation.  TEE yesterday was negative
   for vegetations on the valves and pacer lead.
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - d3 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**])
   - pretreat with NaHCO3 for possible CT torso in the next day or two
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient has demonstrable septic arthritis in
   right wrist and left knee in addition to gouty arthritis.  Other joints
   may be affected as well.  No fluid could be aspirated from the left
   olecranon bursa.  Rheumatology removed pus from right wrist and turbid
   fluid from both knees yesterday.  Right wrist and left knee appear to
   be the most affected joints and likely need washout.  Assistance and
   recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - stopping colchicine giving rising creatinine
   - solumedrol 16 mg daily per rheum for gout; needs slow taper
   - ortho to take to OR for washout later today
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower after
   fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history
   and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain bacteremia and
   new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for PE.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing
   pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient electively
   intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Will keep intubated
   as patient is going to OR today.  Will discuss with ortho whether
   additional washout is planned in near future and patient should remain
   intubated.
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   - sputum culture, wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # ARF: Likely pre-renal as patient appeared underresuscitated on
   presentation.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS I/Os
   documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in the
   ICU.  Patient had some low urine output overnight and was bolused 1L
   once.  Bolused another 1L NS this am.  No evidence of UTI currently.
   Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal etiology
   - Renal ultrasound to assess for intrinsic renal disease, abscess in
   the setting of bacteremia
   - renally dose meds (decrease nafcillin to 2 g Q6H if creatinine >
   4.0)
   - D5NaHCO3 at 75 cc/hr for maintenance fluid as well as pre-treatment
   for CT torso.
   - additional NS boluses prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte
   correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely fe deficiency from colon cancer.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Will cover with
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now as going for surgery; will
   need to start tube feeds within the next day or two.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. The patient presents with atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and bacteremia.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Fever/bacteremia: Blood cultures growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The source of infection is unclear, but the patient has septic joints as well. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated. The patient may have pneumonia, but it cannot be definitively ruled out. A CT torso is recommended, but contrast should be avoided due to the patient's rising creatinine levels.

2. Septic arthritis/gout: The patient has septic arthritis in the right wrist and left knee, along with gouty arthritis. Other joints may also be affected. No fluid could be aspirated from the left olecranon bursa. Rheumatology removed pus from the right wrist and turbid fluid from both knees yesterday. The right wrist and left knee appear to be the most affected joints and likely need washout.

3. Tachypnea/hypoxemia: The patient has subacute exacerbation with a decline over the past 3-4 weeks. No clear evidence of pneumonia by chest X-ray (CXR), although there"

   All joint fluid specimens from [**3-12**] with GPCs on gram stain; cultures of
   prior fluid growing MSSA
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently
   diagnosed colon cancer who presents with A. Fib with RVR and
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Will defer bronchoscopy at present as
   patient has minimal secretions while intubated and no significant
   respiratory symptoms prior to intubation.  Sputum now growing GNRs.  If
   patient has increasing sputum or becomes febrile will consider adding
   gram negative coverage.  TEE on [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the
   valves and pacer lead, but given high grade bacteremia, a small
   vegetation may have been missed.
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - d4 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**])
   - daily EKGs to assess intervals
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - solumedrol 16 mg daily per rheum for gout; needs slow taper
   - ortho following, JP drain still in left knee
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower after
   fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history
   and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain bacteremia and
   new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for PE.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing
   pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient electively
   intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Some difficulty
   weaning patient from vent early in the morning of [**3-13**].
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   .
   # ARF: Likely predominantly pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess.
   - discuss with urology
   - renally dose meds (decrease nafcillin to 2 g Q6H if creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - metoprolol held on evening of [**3-12**] and am [**3-13**] due to low blood
   pressures
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - LFTs, amylase, lipase added on to am labs
   - consider non-contrast abdominal/pelvis CT scan
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency from colon cancer.  Acute
   drop overnight likely secondary to orthopedic washout yesterday.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**].  Will check pm hct.
   - Additional blood prn; pt. has one more unit in house.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Will cover with
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now given potential for extubation
   today.  If not extubated, will consider initiating tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, outpatient PPI for GERD
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line ([**2174-3-11**])

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with A. Fib with RVR and bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Will defer bronchoscopy at present as
   patient has minimal secretions while intubated and no significant
   respiratory symptoms prior to intubation.  Sputum now growing GNRs.  If
   patient has increasing sputum or becomes febrile will consider adding
   gram negative coverage.  TEE on [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the
   valves and pacer lead, but given high grade bacteremia, a small
   vegetation may have been missed.
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - d4 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**])
   - daily EKGs to assess intervals
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - solumedrol 16 mg daily per rheum for gout; needs slow taper
   - ortho following, JP drain still in left knee
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower after
   fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history
   and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain bacteremia and
   new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for PE.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing
   pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient electively
   intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Some difficulty
   weaning patient from vent early in the morning of [**3-13**].
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   .
   # ARF: Likely predominantly pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess.
   - call Urology in AM (moderate right hydronephrosis)
   - Renal in AM for worsening kidney failure.
   - renally dose meds (decrease nafcillin to 2 g Q6H if creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - metoprolol held on evening of [**3-12**] and am [**3-13**] due to low blood
   pressures
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - LFTs, amylase, lipase added on to am labs
   - consider non-contrast abdominal/pelvis CT scan
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency from colon cancer.  Acute
   drop overnight likely secondary to orthopedic washout yesterday.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**].  Will check pm hct.
   - Additional blood prn; pt. has one more unit in house.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Will cover with
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now given potential for extubation
   today.  If not extubated, will consider initiating tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, outpatient PPI for GERD
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line ([**2174-3-11**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and bacteremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to septic arthritis, gouty arthritis, tachypnea, hypoxemia, acute renal failure, tachycardia, and abdominal pain.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. Blood cultures have grown methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and sputum is growing gram-negative rods. The patient has an elevated creatinine level and is on hemodialysis. Electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hyperkalemia and hypophosphatemia.

The patient's medical history includes recent surgery for washout of septic joints, a left kidney mass lesion, and a history of gastrointestinal bleed. He has a pacemaker in place and has experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of advanced COPD, atrial fibrillation, chronic pain, septic arthritis, decubitus ulcer, and chronic kidney disease. The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure, hypothermia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and sepsis. The patient's current condition is critical, and he is still intubated due to high probability of failing extubation. He has multiple comorbidities and ongoing health issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic arthritis and ongoing infection indicated by the presence of oropharyngeal flora in the sputum culture. There is a risk of further sepsis spread and complications.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, as evidenced by rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can lead to further acute renal failure and complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory muscle weakness due to prolonged immobilization.
4. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer. Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of ulcer progression and infection.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of advanced COPD, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, decubitus ulcer, septic arthritis, and acute pain. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment of his multiple conditions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate 70 bpm, blood pressure 109/33 mmHg, respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 20.4 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 25.2%
- White blood cell count: 14.0 K/uL
- Blood urea nitrogen: 42 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL
- Sodium: 139 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.3 mg/dL
- Glucose: 111 mg/dL

The patient's urine output has been decreasing, indicating possible worsening renal failure. He also has a history of chronic renal failure. The creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL suggests impaired kidney function.

The patient is at risk for developing complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His recent sputum culture showed growth of oropharyngeal flora, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with A. Fib with RVR and bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Will defer bronchoscopy at present as
   patient has minimal secretions while intubated and no significant
   respiratory symptoms prior to intubation.  Sputum now growing GNRs.  If
   patient has increasing sputum or becomes febrile will consider adding
   gram negative coverage.  TEE on [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the
   valves and pacer lead, but given high grade bacteremia, a small
   vegetation may have been missed.
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - d4 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**])
   - Will d/c daily EKGs to assess intervals
 not likely myositis
   - F/u mini-BAL results, per ID recs
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - solumedrol 16 mg daily per rheum for gout; needs slow taper
   - ortho following, JP drain still in left knee
 F/u ortho recs
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower after
   fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history
   and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain bacteremia and
   new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for PE.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing
   pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient electively
   intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Some difficulty
   weaning patient from vent early in the morning of [**3-13**].
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   .
   # ARF: Likely predominantly pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess. Pt does have positive WBC on U/A [**2174-3-11**],
   but thought to be contaminant [**2-7**] Foley
 add urine eosiniphils and
   repeat U/A
   - F/u Urology c/s (moderate right hydronephrosis)
   - Renal c/s in AM for worsening kidney failure.
   - renally dose meds (decrease nafcillin to 2 g Q6H if creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - metoprolol held on evening of [**3-12**] and am [**3-13**] due to low blood
   pressures
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - LFTs, amylase, lipase added on to am labs
   - consider non-contrast abdominal/pelvis CT scan
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency from colon cancer.  Acute
   drop overnight likely secondary to orthopedic washout yesterday.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**].  Will check pm hct.
   - Additional blood prn; pt. has one more unit in house.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. The patient presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and bacteremia. He also has septic arthritis and gouty arthritis in multiple joints, requiring orthopedic intervention.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by tachypnea and hypoxemia, which may be due to a subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient underwent elective intubation for multiple procedures and has had difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

Renal function is impaired, with acute kidney injury (ARF) likely secondary to pre-renal causes. The patient has right-sided hydronephrosis, possibly related to a mass lesion in the left kidney. There is also evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient has ruled out the use of coumadin due to recent gastrointestinal bleeding and colon cancer.

Cardiac monitoring shows tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which appears to be a new diagnosis. The patient has been evaluated for possible pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia, and has undergone transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to rule out cardiac sources of embolism.

Abdominal pain is present, and the patient has mild discomfort on"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with A. Fib with RVR and bacteremia.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Will defer bronchoscopy at present as
   patient has minimal secretions while intubated and no significant
   respiratory symptoms prior to intubation.  Sputum now growing GNRs.  If
   patient has increasing sputum or becomes febrile will consider adding
   gram negative coverage.  TEE on [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the
   valves and pacer lead, but given high grade bacteremia, a small
   vegetation may have been missed.
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - d4 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**])
   - Will d/c daily EKGs to assess intervals
 not likely myositis
   - F/u mini-BAL results, per ID recs
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - solumedrol 16 mg daily per rheum for gout; needs slow taper
   - ortho following, JP drain still in left knee
 F/u ortho recs
   .
   # Tachypnea/hypoxemia: Appears to be subacute exacerbation with decline
   over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR although
   possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella antigen
   negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower after
   fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history
   and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain bacteremia and
   new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for PE.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR causing
   pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient electively
   intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Some difficulty
   weaning patient from vent early in the morning of [**3-13**].
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Antibiotics
   - nebulizers
   .
   # ARF: Likely predominantly pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess. Pt does have positive WBC on U/A [**2174-3-11**],
   but thought to be contaminant [**2-7**] Foley
 add urine eosiniphils and
   repeat U/A
   - F/u Urology c/s (moderate right hydronephrosis)
   - Renal c/s in AM for worsening kidney failure.
   - renally dose meds (decrease nafcillin to 2 g Q6H if creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - metoprolol held on evening of [**3-12**] and am [**3-13**] due to low blood
   pressures
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - LFTs, amylase, lipase added on to am labs
   - consider non-contrast abdominal/pelvis CT scan
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency from colon cancer.  Acute
   drop overnight likely secondary to orthopedic washout yesterday.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**].  Will check pm hct.
   - Additional blood prn; pt. has one more unit in house.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Will cover with
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now given potential for extubation
   today. ISS. initiate tube feeds as patient likely to be on vent for
   some time.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He was admitted with atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and bacteremia. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic arthritis, gout, tachypnea/hypoxemia, acute renal failure (ARF), tachycardia, abdominal pain, anemia, colon cancer, pressure ulcers, hyperglycemia, glaucoma, and familial educational needs.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fever/bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not properly treated.
2. Septic arthritis/gout: The patient has septic arthritis combined with gouty arthritis in multiple joints. This requires immediate attention and treatment to prevent further complications.
3. Tachypnea/hypoxemia: The patient's breathing difficulties may worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to respiratory distress or failure.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's kidney function is compromised, and if not managed correctly, it may progress to chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and if left untreated, it may lead to arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR
   although possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella
   antigen negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for
   PE.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR
   causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator with increased O2 requirements,
   which may be more difficult if ARF causes fluid retention.
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated to maximize extubation
   success
   - Cont nebulizers
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Sputum now growing GNRs. Mini BAL neg
   for polys or microorganisms.  If patient has increasing sputum or
   becomes febrile will consider adding gram negative coverage.  TEE on
   [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the valves and pacer lead, but
   given high grade bacteremia, a small vegetation may have been missed.
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - d6 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**]), will likely need
   prolonged course
   .
   # ARF: Initially thought to be pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess. Pt does have positive WBC on U/A [**2174-3-11**],
   but thought to be contaminant [**2-7**] Foley
urine eosinophils negative and
   repeat U/A negative for WBC and RBC
   - F/u Urology c/s for hydronephrosis
 will place nephrostomy drain if
   hydro worsens
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel
   - renally dose meds (decreased nafcillin to 2 g Q6H for creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - ortho following, JP drain to be pulled if output decreases
 F/u
   ortho recs
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - now NSR
   - metoprolol being held for low SBP
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - consider non-contrast abdominal/pelvis CT scan
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency from colon cancer.  Acute
   drop overnight likely secondary to orthopedic washout yesterday.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**].
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   - Guaiac stools
 neg x2
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. initiate tube feeds as patient likely
   to be on vent for some time.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and MSSA bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to difficulty weaning from the ventilator. He also has septic arthritis/gouty arthritis in multiple joints, abdominal pain possibly secondary to a bilary process or colon cancer, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of continued difficulty weaning from the ventilator, which may lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, potentially requiring dialysis.
3. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing MSSA infection, and there is a risk of complications such as sepsis or endocarditis.
4. Septic arthritis/gouty arthritis: The patient has septic arthritis in multiple joints, which can lead to further joint damage and systemic complications if not appropriately managed.
5. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain could be secondary to a bilary process or colon cancer, which may require further investigation and management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been experiencing hypothermia, hypotension, anemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, renal failure, septic arthritis, decubitus ulcer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and acute and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is low, indicating hypothermia. This can lead to decreased metabolic function and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs and may cause organ damage or failure.
3. Anemia: The patient has a low red blood cell count, indicating anemia. This can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and may cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in sodium, potassium, and chloride levels, as well as abnormal fluid balance. These imbalances can affect various organ systems and lead to electrolyte disturbances and fluid overload or depletion.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. Acute renal failure can occur due to decreased kidney perfusion, infection, or toxin exposure, leading to inadequate filtration and accumulation of waste products in the body.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including hypocalcemia, anemia, hypothermia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute renal failure, septic arthritis, decubitus ulcer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and pain control. The patient is intubated and sedated. Vital signs include a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 100/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has been receiving various medications, including morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, potentially causing organ damage or failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may worsen without appropriate treatment.
3. Septic Arthritis: The presence of right knee tenderness and elevated white blood cell count indicates a possible joint infection, which can progress and lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
4. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's pressure ulcer at admission can worsen without proper skin care and repositioning, leading to tissue breakdown and potential infection.
5. Chronic Obstructive Pul"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR
   although possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella
   antigen negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for
   PE.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR
   causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator with increased O2 requirements,
   which may be more difficult if ARF causes fluid retention. Had acute
   increase in O2 requirement on [**3-14**], likely multifactorial in nature
   (stacking pain meds, weaning vent settings, and worsening intravascular
   depletion).
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated to maximize extubation
   success, likely will not take place until renal failure / septic
   physiology improves
   - Continue to try PSV trials (20/5)
   - Coordinate the administration of pain meds to stagger over the course
   of the day
   - Cont nebulizers

   # ARF: Initially thought to be pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess. Pt had positive WBC on U/A [**2174-3-11**], but
   thought to be contaminant [**2-7**] Foley
urine eosinophils negative (argues
   against AIN) and repeat U/A negative for WBC and RBC. Low C3/C4 argues
   for immune complex damage - not specific, but argues for ATN in setting
   of recent prerenal ARF. Cr stable in 4+ range, which could represent a
   slowing of kidney damage.

   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Sputum now growing GNRs. Mini BAL neg
   for polys or microorganisms.  If patient has increasing sputum or

   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and MSSA bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to a subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which may be exacerbated by steroids. There is no clear evidence of pneumonia, but a possible posterobasilar infiltrate is noted on the chest X-ray. A V/Q scan with low probability suggests a pulmonary embolism, but this is not definitive. Aspiration pneumonia is also considered, as the patient has been intubated for multiple procedures.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is initially thought to be pre-renal due to the patient appearing underresuscitated and urine electrolytes consistent with pre-renal etiology. However, the presence of right-sided hydronephrosis, elevated creatinine levels, and low C3/C4 levels suggest immune complex damage, possibly acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has been receiving multiple boluses of intravenous fluids overnight for low urine outputs, and renal ultrasound showed right-sided hydronephrosis without evidence of abscess. Foley urine eosinophils are negative, indicating against acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient's renal function will be closely monitored, and nephrost"

   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to

   respiratory symptoms prior to intubation.  Sputum now growing GNRs.  If
   patient has increasing sputum or becomes febrile will consider adding
   gram negative coverage.  TEE on [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the
   valves and pacer lead, but given high grade bacteremia, a small
   vegetation may have been missed.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR
   although possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella
   antigen negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for
   PE.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR
   causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator with increased O2 requirements,
   which may be more difficult if ARF causes fluid retention.
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated to maximize extubation
   success
   - Cont nebulizers
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Sputum now growing GNRs. Mini BAL neg
   for polys or microorganisms.  If patient has increasing sputum or
   becomes febrile will consider adding gram negative coverage.  TEE on
   [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the valves and pacer lead, but
   given high grade bacteremia, a small vegetation may have been missed.
   - daily surveillance cultures
   - d6 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**]), will likely need
   prolonged course
   .
   # ARF: Initially thought to be pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess. Pt does have positive WBC on U/A [**2174-3-11**],
   but thought to be contaminant [**2-7**] Foley
urine eosinophils negative and
   repeat U/A negative for WBC and RBC
   - F/u Urology c/s for hydronephrosis
 will place nephrostomy drain if
   hydro worsens
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia
   - renally dose meds (decrease nafcillin to 2 g Q6H if creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - ortho following, JP drain to be pulled if output decreases
 F/u
   ortho recs
   .
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - metoprolol held on evening of [**3-12**] and am [**3-13**] due to low blood
   pressures
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - LFTs, amylase, lipase added on to am labs
   - consider non-contrast abdominal/pelvis CT scan
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency from colon cancer.  Acute
   drop overnight likely secondary to orthopedic washout yesterday.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**].  Will check pm hct.
   - Additional blood prn; pt. has one more unit in house.
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Will cover with
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops,
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO for now given potential for extubation
   today. ISS. initiate tube feeds as patient likely to be on vent for
   some time.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: D/c subcutaneous heparin for anemia (?blood loss) and
   start pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line ([**2174-3-11**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and MSSA bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging, especially if acute renal failure leads to fluid retention.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is a significant concern. The source of infection is unclear, and there is a possibility of pneumonia. Surveillance cultures and consideration of gram-negative coverage may be necessary if the patient becomes febrile or shows increasing sputum production.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating ARF. Fluid resuscitation and careful management of electrolytes are essential. Renal ultrasound revealed right-sided hydronephrosis, but no evidence of abscess. A nephrostomy tube may be required if the condition worsens.
4. Septic Arthritis/Gout: The patient has septic arthritis combined with gouty arthritis in multiple joints. Orthopedic intervention and joint tapping have been performed, and antibiotic therapy is ongoing.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Anticoag"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has invasive rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma and is undergoing treatment discussion regarding radiation versus chemotherapy plus radiation.
- The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 23, down from the baseline of 35-37.
- An ID recommendation for a TEE in 1-7 weeks and a CT torso when feasible has been made.
- Blood cultures from 3/14 showed growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs), and the ID recommended changing antibiotics to ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and flagyl while discontinuing nafcillin.
- Sputum cultures also showed GNRs, specifically Enterobacter cloacae, which are sensitive to cefepime and ciprofloxacin.
- The patient has been on various medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), morphine sulfate, and others.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/44 to 90/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,077 mL and output of 1,200 mL, resulting in a balance of 3,877 mL.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support through a CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.
- The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, HCO3- of 106 mEq/L, BE of -8, Ve of 13.7 L/min, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 265, and compliance of 34.4 cmH2O/mL.
- The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, TCO2, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, amylase/lipase, lactic acid, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4.
- The patient's neurologic examination shows no assessment of movement or tone, and the peripheral vascular examination is also incomplete.
- The patient is receiving renal nutrition and has arterial and multi-lumen lines in place for monitoring and medication administration.
- The patient has prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Infection: The presence of GNRs in blood and sputum cultures indicates a potential bacterial infection. The patient is already on appropriate antibiotics, but close monitoring for signs of infection and adjustment of treatment may be necessary.
2. Renal impairment: Elevated creatinine levels suggest possible renal impairment. Changes in antibiotic therapy and consideration for renal biopsy may be needed to further evaluate and manage renal function.
3. Anemia: The low hemoglobin level indicates anemia, which can be related to the ongoing cancer treatment or other underlying causes. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and addressing anemia management may be required.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient is receiving respiratory support, and ABG results show some abnormalities. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary.
5. Coagulation issues: The elevated PT/PTT/INR suggests a coagulation problem. Monitoring for signs of bleeding or clotting disorders and appropriate management may be needed.
6. Metabolic disturbances: Abnormalities in electrolytes and metabolic parameters (e.g., lactic acid, LDH) indicate potential metabolic derangements. Close monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances may"

   Portable CXR [**2174-3-15**]
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-14**], may be some decrease in
   the
   left effusion with persistent retrocardiac opacification. Although the
   appearance is most suggestive of atelectasis, the possibility of
   superimposed
   pneumonia cannot be excluded. A lateral view would be helpful if the
   condition of the patient permits.
   MAG-3 Renal scan [**2174-3-15**]
   INTERPRETATION: Flow and dynamic images were obtained after intravenous
   administration of tracer.
   Blood flow images show prompt appearance of tracer in the aorta with
   diminished
   perfusion of both kidneys.
   Renogram images show minimal cortical uptake of tracer bilaterally and
   no
   evidence of concentration of activity in the cortex or excretion into
   the
   collecting system.
   IMPRESSION: Severe impaired bilateral renal function.
   RUQ U/S [**2174-3-15**]
   FINDINGS: The gallbladder is moderately distended, measuring up to 6 cm
   in
   diameter, but this appearance is unchanged since a prior CT also
   [**2174-2-24**].
   The wall is not thickened. A 13-mm shadowing stone is present with a
   small
   amount of sludge. A tiny amount of pericholecystic fluid is present,
   but
   is non=specific, particularly in the presence of a small amount of
   ascites
   also found elsewhere about the liver. There is no intra- or extra-
   hepatic
   biliary ductal dilatation. The flow in the main portal vein is
   hepatopetal.
   IMPRESSION: Moderately distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, not
   significantly changed, but with no specific features for cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR
   although possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella
   antigen negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for
   PE.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR
   causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator with increased O2 requirements,
   which may be more difficult if ARF causes fluid retention. Had acute
   increase in O2 requirement on [**3-14**], likely multifactorial in nature
   (stacking pain meds, weaning vent settings, and worsening intravascular
   depletion).
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated to maximize extubation
   success, likely will not take place until renal failure / septic
   physiology improves
   - Continue to try PSV trials (20/5)
   - Coordinate the administration of pain meds to stagger over the course
   of the day
   - Cont nebulizers
   .
   # ARF: Initially thought to be pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess. Pt had positive WBC on U/A [**2174-3-11**], but
   thought to be contaminant [**2-7**] Foley
urine eosinophils negative (argues
   against AIN) and repeat U/A negative for WBC and RBC. Low C3/C4 argues
   for immune complex damage - not specific, but argues for ATN in setting
   of recent prerenal ARF. Cr stable in 4+ range, which could represent a
   slowing of kidney damage.
   - Trend lytes
   - F/u Urology c/s for hydronephrosis
 will place nephrostomy drain if
   hydro worsens
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel
 will add AlOH for increasing phos
   - Renally dose meds (decreased nafcillin to 2 g Q6H for creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn, as UOP and CVP increase with fluid infusion
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Sputum now growing GNRs. Mini BAL neg
   for polys or microorganisms.  If patient has increasing sputum or
   becomes febrile will consider adding gram negative coverage.  TEE on
   [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the valves and pacer lead
 small
   vegetation cannot be ruled out.
   - daily surveillance cultures
 so far are negative after the initial
   positive bld cx
   - d6 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**]), will think about
   an endpoint to antibiotics as bld cx finalize
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 pulled L knee JP drain this AM
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - now NSR
   - metoprolol being held for low SBP
 will d/c for now, but continue
   amiodarone po as hemodynamics worsen with a-fib
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - will repeat RUQ U/S to work up possible worsening gall bladder dx
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency and anemia of chronic
   disease from colon cancer.  Acute drop overnight likely secondary to
   orthopedic washout yesterday.  Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of
   [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin not decreased and LDH not largely
   elevated, so hemolysis less likely
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   - Guaiac stools
 neg x2
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with acute fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been experiencing subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a decline over the past 3-4 weeks. There is no clear evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray, but there may be a posterobasilar infiltrate. The patient has a positive urinary Legionella antigen, mildly elevated lactate levels, and evidence for COPD exacerbation. There is also some concern for pulmonary embolism, but a V/Q scan shows low probability. The patient has been intubated due to difficulty weaning from the ventilator and increased oxygen requirements, which may be related to ARF and fluid retention.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to COPD exacerbation, aspiration, or a pulmonary embolism. He requires continued weaning from the ventilator with conservative management, PSV trials, coordinated administration of pain medications, and nebulizers.
2. ARF: Initially thought to be pre-renal, but now believed to be intrinsic renal failure. The patient has severe impaired bilateral renal function, and further evaluation is needed, including a renal biopsy and changing antibiotics. Renal dosing of"

   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-14**], may be some decrease in
   the
   left effusion with persistent retrocardiac opacification. Although the
   appearance is most suggestive of atelectasis, the possibility of
   superimposed
   pneumonia cannot be excluded. A lateral view would be helpful if the
   condition of the patient permits.
   MAG-3 Renal scan [**2174-3-15**]
   INTERPRETATION: Flow and dynamic images were obtained after intravenous
   administration of tracer.
   Blood flow images show prompt appearance of tracer in the aorta with
   diminished
   perfusion of both kidneys.
   Renogram images show minimal cortical uptake of tracer bilaterally and
   no
   evidence of concentration of activity in the cortex or excretion into
   the
   collecting system.
   IMPRESSION: Severe impaired bilateral renal function.
   RUQ U/S [**2174-3-15**]
   FINDINGS: The gallbladder is moderately distended, measuring up to 6 cm
   in
   diameter, but this appearance is unchanged since a prior CT also
   [**2174-2-24**].
   The wall is not thickened. A 13-mm shadowing stone is present with a
   small
   amount of sludge. A tiny amount of pericholecystic fluid is present,
   but
   is non=specific, particularly in the presence of a small amount of
   ascites
   also found elsewhere about the liver. There is no intra- or extra-
   hepatic
   biliary ductal dilatation. The flow in the main portal vein is
   hepatopetal.
   IMPRESSION: Moderately distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, not
   significantly changed, but with no specific features for cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR
   although possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella
   antigen negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for
   PE.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR
   causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator with increased O2 requirements,
   which may be more difficult if ARF causes fluid retention. Had acute
   increase in O2 requirement on [**3-14**], likely multifactorial in nature
   (stacking pain meds, weaning vent settings, and worsening intravascular
   depletion).
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated to maximize extubation
   success, likely will not take place until renal failure / septic
   physiology improves
   - Continue to try PSV trials (20/5)
   - Coordinate the administration of pain meds to stagger over the course
   of the day
   - Cont nebulizers
   .
   # ARF: Initially thought to be pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess. Pt had positive WBC on U/A [**2174-3-11**], but
   thought to be contaminant [**2-7**] Foley
urine eosinophils negative (argues
   against AIN) and repeat U/A negative for WBC and RBC. Low C3/C4 argues
   for immune complex damage - not specific, but argues for ATN in setting
   of recent prerenal ARF. Cr stable in 4+ range, which could represent a
   slowing of kidney damage.
   - Trend lytes
   - F/u Urology c/s for hydronephrosis
 will place nephrostomy drain if
   hydro worsens
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel
 will add AlOH for increasing phos
   - Renally dose meds (decreased nafcillin to 2 g Q6H for creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn, as UOP and CVP increase with fluid infusion
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Sputum now growing GNRs. Mini BAL neg
   for polys or microorganisms.  If patient has increasing sputum or
   becomes febrile will consider adding gram negative coverage.  TEE on
   [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the valves and pacer lead
 small
   vegetation cannot be ruled out.
   - daily surveillance cultures
 so far are negative after the initial
   positive bld cx
   - d6 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**]), will think about
   an endpoint to antibiotics as bld cx finalize
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 pulled L knee JP drain this AM
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - now NSR
   - metoprolol being held for low SBP
 will d/c for now, but continue
   amiodarone po as hemodynamics worsen with a-fib
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - will repeat RUQ U/S to work up possible worsening gall bladder dx
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency and anemia of chronic
   disease from colon cancer.  Acute drop overnight likely secondary to
   orthopedic washout yesterday.  Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of
   [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin not decreased and LDH not largely
   elevated, so hemolysis less likely
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A. Fib with RVR) and MSSA bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF).

Respiratory Failure:
The patient has been experiencing a subacute exacerbation of his respiratory condition over the past 3-4 weeks. No clear evidence of pneumonia is seen on chest X-ray (CXR), although a possible posterobasilar infiltrate is noted. Urinary Legionella antigen is negative. The patient's lactate levels were mildly elevated on presentation but decreased after fluid resuscitation. There is some evidence suggesting a COPD exacerbation due to a history of steroid taper, but this does not explain the bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR. A V/Q scan with low probability for pulmonary embolism (PE) was performed. The patient was electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures. Difficulty weaning the patient from the ventilator has been observed, with increased oxygen requirements. This may be more challenging if ARF causes fluid retention. The patient had an acute increase in oxygen requirement on [**3-14**], likely multifactorial in nature (stacking pain medications, weaning vent settings, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR
   although possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella
   antigen negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for
   PE.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR
   causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator with increased O2 requirements,
   which may be more difficult if ARF causes fluid retention. Had acute
   increase in O2 requirement on [**3-14**], likely multifactorial in nature
   (stacking pain meds, weaning vent settings, and worsening intravascular
   depletion).
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated to maximize extubation
   success, likely will not take place until renal failure / septic
   physiology improves
   - Continue to try PSV trials (20/5)
   - Coordinate the administration of pain meds to stagger over the course
   of the day
   - Cont nebulizers
   .
   # ARF: Initially thought to be pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess. Pt had positive WBC on U/A [**2174-3-11**], but
   thought to be contaminant [**2-7**] Foley
urine eosinophils negative (argues
   against AIN) and repeat U/A negative for WBC and RBC. Low C3/C4 argues
   for immune complex damage - not specific, but argues for ATN in setting
   of recent prerenal ARF. Cr stable in 4+ range, which could represent a
   slowing of kidney damage.
   - Trend lytes
   - F/u Urology c/s for hydronephrosis
 will place nephrostomy drain if
   hydro worsens
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel
 will add AlOH for increasing phos
   - Renally dose meds (decreased nafcillin to 2 g Q6H for creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn, as UOP and CVP increase with fluid infusion
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Sputum now growing GNRs. Mini BAL neg
   for polys or microorganisms.  If patient has increasing sputum or
   becomes febrile will consider adding gram negative coverage.  TEE on
   [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the valves and pacer lead
 small
   vegetation cannot be ruled out.
   - daily surveillance cultures
 so far are negative after the initial
   positive bld cx
   - d6 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**]), will think about
   an endpoint to antibiotics as bld cx finalize
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 pulled L knee JP drain this AM
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - now NSR
   - metoprolol being held for low SBP
 will d/c for now, but continue
   amiodarone po as hemodynamics worsen with a-fib
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - will repeat RUQ U/S to work up possible worsening gall bladder dx
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency and anemia of chronic
   disease from colon cancer.  Acute drop overnight likely secondary to
   orthopedic washout yesterday.  Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of
   [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin not decreased and LDH not largely
   elevated, so hemolysis less likely
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   - Guaiac stools

   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.

   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new onset atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and possible aspiration. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and noninvasive ventilation have been initiated, and weaning from the ventilator is being attempted as tolerated. However, the patient's renal failure and septic physiology may complicate the weaning process.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient initially presented with pre-renal azotemia, but now has evidence of intrinsic renal injury. The cause of ARF is likely multifactorial, including sepsis, hypoperfusion, and possibly obstruction due to a right-sided hydronephrosis. The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, and further investigations such as a renal biopsy may be required.

3. Sepsis/Fever/Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, and the source of infection is unclear. He also has elevated inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP, suggesting"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  No clear evidence of pneumonia by CXR
   although possible posterobasilar infiltrate.  Urinary Legionella
   antigen negative.   Lactate mildly elevated on presentation, but lower
   after fluid resuscitation.  Some evidence for COPD exacerbation by
   history and in setting of steroid taper, but does not explain
   bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR.  V/Q scan with low probability for
   PE.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent mild diastolic dysfunction [**2-7**] to a. fib with RVR
   causing pulmonary edema.  Lastly would consider aspiration.  Patient
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator with increased O2 requirements,
   which may be more difficult if ARF causes fluid retention. Had acute
   increase in O2 requirement on [**3-14**], likely multifactorial in nature
   (stacking pain meds, weaning vent settings, and worsening intravascular
   depletion).
   - Cont. to wean vent settings as tolerated to maximize extubation
   success, likely will not take place until renal failure / septic
   physiology improves
   - Continue to try PSV trials (20/5)
   - Coordinate the administration of pain meds to stagger over the course
   of the day
   - Cont nebulizers
   .
   # ARF: Initially thought to be pre-renal as patient appeared
   underresuscitated on presentation and urine lytes consistent with
   pre-renal etiology.  Previous baseline 1.3-1.5 at [**Hospital1 1**] [**Location (un) 78**]. LOS
   I/Os documentation
 includes 4L patient received prior to arriving in
   the ICU.  Patient received multiple boluses of IVF overnight for low
   urine outputs with CVPs 10-11.  No evidence of UTI currently.  Renal
   ultrasound yesterday with right-sided hydronephrosis (of note patient
   has a mass lesion in left kidney previously documented at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 78**])
   but no evidence of abscess. Pt had positive WBC on U/A [**2174-3-11**], but
   thought to be contaminant [**2-7**] Foley
urine eosinophils negative (argues
   against AIN) and repeat U/A negative for WBC and RBC. Low C3/C4 argues
   for immune complex damage - not specific, but argues for ATN in setting
   of recent prerenal ARF. Cr stable in 4+ range, which could represent a
   slowing of kidney damage.
   - Trend lytes
   - F/u Urology c/s for hydronephrosis
 will place nephrostomy drain if
   hydro worsens
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel
 will add AlOH for increasing phos
   - Renally dose meds (decreased nafcillin to 2 g Q6H for creatinine >
   4.0)
   - NS boluses and blood prn, as UOP and CVP increase with fluid infusion
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures from [**Location (un) 78**] growing MSSA.  Source
   unclear. ESR and CRP are markedly elevated and patient has septic
   joints as well.  Presentation not convincing for pneumonia, but cannot
   definitely rule out.  LAT CXR not of high enough quality to visualize
   retrocardiac opacity.  ID recommended CT torso, however, patient
   creatinine is acutely elevated and contrast at this time is likely to
   result in further kidney injury.  Sputum now growing GNRs. Mini BAL neg
   for polys or microorganisms.  If patient has increasing sputum or
   becomes febrile will consider adding gram negative coverage.  TEE on
   [**3-11**] was negative for vegetations on the valves and pacer lead
 small
   vegetation cannot be ruled out.
   - daily surveillance cultures
 so far are negative after the initial
   positive bld cx
   - d6 nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (Day 1 = [**2174-3-10**]), will think about
   an endpoint to antibiotics as bld cx finalize
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 pulled L knee JP drain this AM
   .
   # Tachycardia: A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new diagnosis for this
   patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI.  Now off dilt drip and
   on PO metoprolol TID.  On reduced amnio dose per EP recs.  Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of
   hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte correction.
   Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - now NSR
   - metoprolol being held for low SBP
 will d/c for now, but continue
   amiodarone po as hemodynamics worsen with a-fib
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - will repeat RUQ U/S to work up possible worsening gall bladder dx
   .
   # Anemia: Chronically, likely iron deficiency and anemia of chronic
   disease from colon cancer.  Acute drop overnight likely secondary to
   orthopedic washout yesterday.  Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of
   [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin not decreased and LDH not largely
   elevated, so hemolysis less likely
   - continue iron replacement
   - obtain outpatient records.
   - Guaiac stools
 neg x2
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - obtain outpatient records.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. initiate tube feeds as patient likely
   to be on vent for some time.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line ([**2174-3-11**]), will place
   PICC today for ATBx IV (bacteremia)

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new onset atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF).

Respiratory failure: The patient presented with a subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) over the past 3-4 weeks. No clear evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray, although a possible posterobasilar infiltrate is noted. Lactate levels were mildly elevated on presentation but decreased after fluid resuscitation. There is some evidence for COPD exacerbation by history and in the setting of steroid taper, but it does not explain bacteremia and new A. Fib with RVR. A V/Q scan showed low probability for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was electively intubated on [date] to perform multiple procedures. Difficulty weaning the patient from the ventilator with increased O2 requirements, which may be more difficult if ARF causes fluid retention. Had an acute increase in O2 requirement on [date], likely multifactorial in nature (stacking pain medications, weaning vent settings, and worsening intravascular depletion).

ARF: Initially thought to be pre-"

   [**Date range (1) 4703**] Joint fluid (both knees, both elbows, right wrist): All showing
   MSSA
   [**3-9**] Urine Cx negative, Urine Legionella antigen negative
   Portable CXR [**2174-3-15**]
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-14**], may be some decrease in
   the
   left effusion with persistent retrocardiac opacification. Although the
   appearance is most suggestive of atelectasis, the possibility of
   superimposed
   pneumonia cannot be excluded. A lateral view would be helpful if the
   condition of the patient permits.
   MAG-3 Renal scan [**2174-3-15**]
   INTERPRETATION: Flow and dynamic images were obtained after intravenous
   administration of tracer.
   Blood flow images show prompt appearance of tracer in the aorta with
   diminished
   perfusion of both kidneys.
   Renogram images show minimal cortical uptake of tracer bilaterally and
   no
   evidence of concentration of activity in the cortex or excretion into
   the
   collecting system.
   IMPRESSION: Severe impaired bilateral renal function.
   RUQ U/S [**2174-3-15**]
   FINDINGS: The gallbladder is moderately distended, measuring up to 6 cm
   in
   diameter, but this appearance is unchanged since a prior CT also
   [**2174-2-24**].
   The wall is not thickened. A 13-mm shadowing stone is present with a
   small
   amount of sludge. A tiny amount of pericholecystic fluid is present,
   but
   is non=specific, particularly in the presence of a small amount of
   ascites
   also found elsewhere about the liver. There is no intra- or extra-
   hepatic
   biliary ductal dilatation. The flow in the main portal vein is
   hepatopetal.
   IMPRESSION: Moderately distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, not
   significantly changed, but with no specific features for cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. [**Month (only) 11**] be extubatable today as pt doing well on minimal
   pressure support with minimal secretions. Pt more alert. Pt is 17L
   positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF
   - Try a long SBT to maximize extubation success
   - Hold Tube feeds and place NGT prior to extubation
   - Follow ABGs
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA. BCx from [**3-14**] showing GNR.
   Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae (sensitive to cefepime and
   cipro), likely representing VAP (however mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started yesterday)
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending microbio studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to Nafcillin (has been d/c
d yesterday
   with more microbio data anyhow). Has moderate R-sided hydronephrosis of
   unknown etiology. Also there is a mass lesion on the left previously
   seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - F/u urology re: hydro
recommends checking CT abd without contrast for
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel and AlOH for hyperPhos. If renal fxn worsens, consider biopsy
   - Nafcillin already d/c
d (see above)
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 ask if further procedures are planned in near future
   .
   # Tachycardia: presented with A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new
   diagnosis for this patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given
   recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI. Had
   TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in
   the setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte
   correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - now NSR
   - metoprolol being held for low SBP
 will continue amiodarone po
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis. Had CT abd
   scheduled as above.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos yesterday
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37. Pt presented in [**2174-2-6**] with
   hct drop to 23 then was diagnosed with invasive colon ca.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for today; will defer this
   issue until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. Hold TF today in preparation of
   extubation. Place NGT prior to extubation.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line ([**2174-3-11**])

   superimposed
   pneumonia cannot be excluded. A lateral view would be helpful if the
   condition of the patient permits.
   MAG-3 Renal scan [**2174-3-15**]
   INTERPRETATION: Flow and dynamic images were obtained after intravenous
   administration of tracer.
   Blood flow images show prompt appearance of tracer in the aorta with
   diminished
   perfusion of both kidneys.
   Renogram images show minimal cortical uptake of tracer bilaterally and
   no
   evidence of concentration of activity in the cortex or excretion into
   the
   collecting system.
   IMPRESSION: Severe impaired bilateral renal function.
   RUQ U/S [**2174-3-15**]
   FINDINGS: The gallbladder is moderately distended, measuring up to 6 cm
   in
   diameter, but this appearance is unchanged since a prior CT also
   [**2174-2-24**].
   The wall is not thickened. A 13-mm shadowing stone is present with a
   small
   amount of sludge. A tiny amount of pericholecystic fluid is present,
   but
   is non=specific, particularly in the presence of a small amount of
   ascites
   also found elsewhere about the liver. There is no intra- or extra-
   hepatic
   biliary ductal dilatation. The flow in the main portal vein is
   hepatopetal.
   IMPRESSION: Moderately distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, not
   significantly changed, but with no specific features for cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. [**Month (only) 11**] be extubatable today as pt doing well on minimal
   pressure support with minimal secretions. Pt more alert. Pt is 17L
   positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF
   - Try a long SBT to maximize extubation success
   - Hold Tube feeds and place NGT prior to extubation
   - Follow ABGs
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA. BCx from [**3-14**] showing GNR.
   Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae (sensitive to cefepime and
   cipro), likely representing VAP (however mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started yesterday)
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending microbio studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to Nafcillin (has been d/c
d yesterday
   with more microbio data anyhow). Has moderate R-sided hydronephrosis of
   unknown etiology. Also there is a mass lesion on the left previously
   seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - F/u urology re: hydro
recommends checking CT abd without contrast for
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel and AlOH for hyperPhos. If renal fxn worsens, consider biopsy
   - Nafcillin already d/c
d (see above)
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 ask if further procedures are planned in near future
   .
   # Tachycardia: presented with A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new
   diagnosis for this patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given
   recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI. Had
   TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in
   the setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte
   correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - now NSR
   - metoprolol being held for low SBP
 will continue amiodarone po
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis. Had CT abd
   scheduled as above.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos yesterday
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37. Pt presented in [**2174-2-6**] with
   hct drop to 23 then was diagnosed with invasive colon ca.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for today; will defer this
   issue until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. Hold TF today in preparation of
   extubation. Place NGT prior to extubation.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line ([**2174-3-11**])
   .
   # Code: Full
   .
   # Communication: Patient,  Wife
   .
   # Disposition: Requires ICU level of care, but will talk with family
   re: escalation of care in regards to worsening renal failure
   (?hemodialysis) and prolonged intubation, in setting of newly diagnosed
   colon CA.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer.
- He presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and MSSA bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient has been intubated due to subacute exacerbation of COPD and fluid retention.
- Blood cultures on 3/14 showed gram-negative rods (GNRs), and sputum also showed Enterobacter cloacae, which is sensitive to cefepime and ciprofloxacin.
- The patient's renal function has been impaired, with moderate right-sided hydronephrosis of unknown etiology.
- He has septic arthritis in multiple joints, and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
- The patient also has a history of gout, and colchicine was stopped due to elevated creatinine levels.
- He is experiencing tachycardia, likely related to atrial fibrillation with RVR.
- The patient's abdominal pain could be secondary to a biliary process, bacteremia, or other processes related to his colon cancer.
- He has anemia, likely gastrointestinal bleeding from colon cancer and anemia of chronic disease.
- The patient has a diagnosis of invasive colon cancer with extensive lymphadenopathy in the chest.
- Pressure ulcers are present, and local wound care and frequent turns are recommended.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are being managed with a sliding scale of Humalog insulin.
- Eye drops for glaucoma are being continued.
- Fluids and electrolytes are being carefully monitored.
- Prophylactic measures such as HSC, pneumoboots, and PPI are being administered.
- The patient has arterial and central lines in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is already impaired, and there is a risk of AKI progressing to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or requiring hemodialysis.

3. Infection: The presence of MSSA bacteremia and Enterobacter cloacae in the sputum indicates an ongoing infection risk. The patient is also at risk of developing new infections due to his immunocompromised state and invasive devices.

4. Colon cancer progression: The patient has recently been diagnosed with invasive colon cancer, which can potentially progress and lead to metastasis or complications related to the gastrointestinal tract.

5. Pressure ulcers: The patient has pressure ulcers, which can worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of infection and potential complications.

6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can recur and lead to further complications.

7. Cardiovascular events: The patient's history of CAD and CHF puts him at risk for cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure exacerbation.

8. Septic arthritis: The patient's septic arthritis in multiple joints requires careful management to prevent further joint damage and systemic complications.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current health status and medical history."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU for invasive rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma with no known metastasis. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, pain control, septic arthritis, decubitus ulcer, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypothermia, anemia, hypotension, and hypocalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a concern for acute renal failure. Further evaluation and management, such as renal biopsy and medication adjustments, may be necessary.
2. Infection: The presence of GNRs (Gram-negative rods) in blood cultures indicates a possible bloodstream infection. Antibiotics have been prescribed based on the sensitivity results.
3. Septic arthritis: The patient has a history of septic arthritis, which can lead to joint infections. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate treatment are crucial.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, which increases the risk of developing further pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility. Regular repositioning and wound care are essential.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and while there is no acute exacerbation mentioned, it is important to monitor respiratory status and provide appropriate bronchial hygiene"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. [**Month (only) 11**] be extubatable today as pt doing well on minimal
   pressure support with minimal secretions. Pt more alert. Pt is 17L
   positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube feeds held
   overnight.
   - plan to extubate today
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA. BCx from anerobic bottle
   on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae (sensitive
   to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however mini-BAL
   negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to Nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel and AlOH for hyperPhos. If renal fxn worsens, consider biopsy
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.  Ortho
   is watching right wrist and may consider repeat washout in future.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 ask if further procedures are planned in near future
   .
   # Tachycardia: Resolved.  Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient.  Likely not a candidate
   for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient has ruled
   out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted
   to NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR
   after electrolyte correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - now NSR
   - metoprolol stopped due to low SBP
 will continue amiodarone po
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is
   stable.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no
   other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis. Had CT abd
   scheduled as above.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos yesterday
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37. Pt presented in [**2174-2-6**] with
   hct drop to 23 then was diagnosed with invasive colon ca.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for today; will defer this
   issue until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. Hold TF today in preparation of
   extubation. NGT placed
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line ([**2174-3-11**])
   .
   # Code: DNR, okay to reintubate.  Okay to turn of AICD if firing
   repetitively
   .
   # Communication: Patient,  Wife
   .
   # Disposition: Requires ICU level of care.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure.

The patient's respiratory failure is characterized by subacute exacerbation with a decline over the past 3-4 weeks. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at baseline and was electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures. Difficulty in weaning the patient from the ventilator initially occurred due to fluid retention and baseline COPD. The plan is to extubate today as the patient is doing well on minimal pressure support with minimal secretions.

The patient also has fever and bacteremia, with blood cultures showing MSSA. Sputum also shows enterobacter cloacae, likely representing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), although mini-BAL was negative. The patient was switched from nafcillin to Cipro, Cefepime, and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**]). Follow-up final BCx and speciation/sensi studies will be done to further tailor antibiotics. ID recs include TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible.

The patient's acute renal failure is most likely initially pre-renal, then tipped"

   Chief Complaint: AICD firing, bacteremia
   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs: Current regimen of Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl OK for now.
   Change Cefepime to 1g Q24h given renal insuff. If CrCl drops further,
   new dosing regimen is Cefepime 500 mg IV Q24h, Cipro 200 mg Q24h
   Repeat Echo within a week
   CT torso when feasible
   Repeat BCx - if positive, d/c or change line
   - Ortho recs: watching R wrist closely. No plans to take pt back to OR
   for at least a few days.
   - Urology recs: get CT abd without contrast for ?stones
   dictated read: bilat basilar consolidation, worse compared with
   previous imaging on [**2174-2-24**] maybe PNA +/- aspiration ; bilat pleural
   effusion; no pericardial effusion. No definite focal lesions in liver,
   spleen, adrenals. Pancreas slightly atrophic. Dense calcifications in
   kidneys are c/w vascular calcification. No urolithiasis. No
   hydronephrosis in either kidney. 4.2 x 2.9 cyst in right kidney is
   unchanged. Other cysts are not well visualized. Again visualized 1.5 cm
   cyst in medial upper left kidney.   + ascites. GB distended with
   dependent gallstones. Small bowel unremarkable. No free air in abdomen.
   Previously described rectosigmoid mass is not well appreciated due to
   no contrast.
   No hydronephrosis. Large kidney cyst unchanged.
   cholelithiasis. Bilateral renal cysts, not fully evaluated due to lack
   of contrast.
   - Renal recs: dose meds for GFR<15, may do renal bx if worsens.
   Consider bicarb repletion of pH<7.2 and difficulty with vent.
   - PS 5/0 -> ABG 7.25/40/90
   - Was put back on PS 5/5 overnight to rest. -> repeat ABG
   - NGT placed and TF held in anticipation of extubation however not
   extubated today (pt was off floor for long periods of time for studies)
   - Increased Morphine freq from Q4 to Q2h (SBP to 188 with turning)

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. [**Month (only) 11**] be extubatable today as pt doing well on minimal
   pressure support with minimal secretions. Pt more alert. Pt is 17L
   positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF
   - Try a long SBT to maximize extubation success
   - Hold Tube feeds and place NGT prior to extubation
   - Follow ABGs
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA. BCx from [**3-14**] showing GNR.
   Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae (sensitive to cefepime and
   cipro), likely representing VAP (however mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started yesterday)
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending microbio studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to Nafcillin (has been d/c
d yesterday
   with more microbio data anyhow). Has moderate R-sided hydronephrosis of
   unknown etiology. Also there is a mass lesion on the left previously
   seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - F/u urology re: hydro
recommends checking CT abd without contrast for
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel and AlOH for hyperPhos. If renal fxn worsens, consider biopsy
   - Nafcillin already d/c
d (see above)
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 ask if further procedures are planned in near future
   .
   # Tachycardia: presented with A. Fib with RVR
 appears to be a new
   diagnosis for this patient.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given
   recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI. Had
   TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in
   the setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte
   correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP.
   - now NSR
   - metoprolol being held for low SBP
 will continue amiodarone po
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam yesterday which appears
   to be worse today.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis. Had CT abd
   scheduled as above.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos yesterday
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37. Pt presented in [**2174-2-6**] with
   hct drop to 23 then was diagnosed with invasive colon ca.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for today; will defer this
   issue until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. Hold TF today in preparation of
   extubation. Place NGT prior to extubation.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line ([**2174-3-11**])
   .
   # Code: Full
   .
   # Communication: Patient,  Wife
   .
   # Disposition: Requires ICU level of care, but will talk with family
   re: escalation of care in regards to worsening renal failure
   (?hemodialysis) and prolonged intubation, in setting of newly diagnosed
   colon CA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation and MSSA bacteremia, as well as respiratory failure and acute renal failure.

The patient had difficulty weaning off the ventilator initially due to fluid retention and underlying COPD. He is currently on minimal pressure support and is alert. The patient has been intubated since March 11th for multiple procedures.

Fever and bacteremia were noted, with blood cultures showing MSSA and GNR. Sputum also showed enterobacter cloacae, which is sensitive to cefepime and ciprofloxacin. The patient's antibiotic regimen was switched to Cipro, Cefepime, and Flagyl.

Acute renal failure is suspected, likely initially pre-renal and then tipping over to acute tubular necrosis. Moderate right-sided hydronephrosis of unknown etiology was also observed. Renal function has been stable in the 4+ range. Renal dosing of medications is recommended, and if renal function worsens, a biopsy may be considered.

Septic arthritis and gout are present, with bacteria found in gram stains from joint taps. Orthopedic and rheumatology recommendations are appreciated.

Tachycardia is likely a new diagnosis for this patient, possibly not a candidate for coumadin due to recent gastrointestinal"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. [**Month (only) 11**] be extubatable today as pt doing well on minimal
   pressure support with minimal secretions. Pt more alert. Pt is 17L
   positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube feeds held
   overnight.
   - re-intubated for respiratory failure
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA. BCx from anerobic bottle
   on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae (sensitive
   to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however mini-BAL
   negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to Nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 no need for HD at this time, treat hyperphosphatemia with
   Renagel and increase dose of AlOH. If renal fxn worsens, consider
   biopsy
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.  Ortho
   is watching right wrist and may consider repeat washout in future.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 ask if further procedures are planned in near future
   .
   # Tachycardia: Resolved.  Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient.  Likely not a candidate
   for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient has ruled
   out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted
   to NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR
   after electrolyte correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP. Appears
   to have gone back into a-fib in the AM of [**3-18**]
   - EKG in AM
   - Metoprolol IV for a-fib
   - continue amiodarone per NG
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Abdominal pain: The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is
   stable.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no
   other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos yesterday
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37. Pt presented in [**2174-2-6**] with
   hct drop to 23 then was diagnosed with invasive colon ca.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for today; will defer this
   issue until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. NGT placed. Tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line ([**2174-3-11**]), RUE PICC
   (placed [**3-17**])
   .
   # Code: DNR.  Okay to turn off AICD if firing repetitively.
   .
   # Communication: Patient,  Wife
   .
   # Disposition: Requires ICU level of care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presented with new onset atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, septic arthritis, gout, tachycardia, abdominal pain, anemia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's baseline COPD and fluid retention have made it difficult to wean him off the ventilator. There is a risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation or further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Bacteremia and Sepsis: The presence of MSSA bacteremia and other bacteria in the blood cultures indicates a risk of sepsis. This could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen the patient's overall condition.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has pre-renal azotemia followed by acute tubular necrosis. It is crucial to monitor renal function closely and manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances to prevent further renal damage.
4. Septic Arthritis and Gout: The patient has septic arthritis combined with gouty arthritis in multiple joints. This poses a risk of joint destruction and systemic complications.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia, initially attributed to atrial fibrillation, has resolved but may recur. Appropriate management is necessary to prevent cardiac complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient, which was controlled
   with amiodarone.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI
   bleed and colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte
   correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP. Appears to have gone back
   into a-fib in the AM of [**3-18**] in setting of hypoxemia.
   - EKG in AM
   - Fluid boluses  and metoprolol IV x1 to attempt cardioversion, will
   speak with family re: cardioversion/TEE for presumed endocarditis
   - continue amiodarone per NG, consider rebolus as hemodynamics improve
   when patient is in NSR, if family wishes
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**]. Pt more alert. Pt is
   17L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube feeds
   held overnight.
   - re-intubated for worsening acidosis and hypoventilation with fatigue
   overnight
   - Will speak with family regarding long-term ventilator assist as it
   may be increasingly difficult to wean patient in light of recent
   decline.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 treat hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increase dose of
   AlOH. If renal fxn worsens, consider biopsy
   - Will consider HD, per family wishes, as situation is now very grave
   with worsening UOP after it had picked up over the past 2 days.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.  Ortho
   is watching right wrist and may consider repeat washout in future.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Continue slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 No plan for future procedures
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Unable to assess recently in light of intubation and
   sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on presentation.
   He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is stable.
   Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no other
   findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos yesterday
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT, uremia and DIC.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for today; will defer this
   issue until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns, monitor areas of peripheral
   necrosis
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. NGT placed. Tube feeds.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. The patient presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was treated with amiodarone. He also had MSSA bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient was initially intubated for multiple procedures and had difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to fluid retention and baseline COPD. He was extubated in the afternoon but reintubated in the morning for worsening acidosis and hypoventilation. The patient's toes show signs of necrosis, and there is mottling in his left foot with decreased pulses. Blood cultures showed MSSA and enterobacter cloacae, which are likely due to endocarditis. The patient was started on ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and flagyl. 

The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF) with pre-renal azotemia tipping over to acute tubular necrosis. His urine output has improved but remains low, and his creatinine levels are stable in the 4+ range. The patient's electrolytes need to be trended, and renal consults should be obtained. 

The patient has septic arthritis combined with gouty arthritis in multiple joints, and orthopedic consultation is recommended. 

The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to a biliary process or bacteremia."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. They were loaded with IV Amio and reverted from atrial fibrillation (AFib) back to sinus rhythm. The patient is currently on morphine drip with Neo prn to support blood pressure. The AICD was turned off by the EP. Non-crushable medications were discontinued.

The patient received antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and metronidazole, within the last 24 hours. They are receiving infusions of morphine sulfate, amiodarone, and phenylephrine. Other ICU medications include metoprolol and additional doses of morphine sulfate. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate between 64 and 127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/37 to 133/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,859 mL, including 633 mL of IV fluids. Output includes 1,369 mL of blood products, 1,069 mL of urine, and 300 mL of NG and stool drainage. The respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with CMV"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient, which was controlled
   with amiodarone.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI
   bleed and colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte
   correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP. Appears to have gone back
   into a-fib in the AM of [**3-18**] in setting of hypoxemia.
   - EKG in AM
   - Fluid boluses  and metoprolol IV x1 to attempt cardioversion, will
   speak with family re: cardioversion/TEE for presumed endocarditis
   - continue amiodarone per NG, consider rebolus as hemodynamics improve
   when patient is in NSR, if family wishes
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**]. Pt more alert. Pt is
   17L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube feeds
   held overnight.
   - re-intubated for worsening acidosis and hypoventilation with fatigue
   overnight
   - Will speak with family regarding long-term ventilator assist as it
   may be increasingly difficult to wean patient in light of recent
   decline.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 treat hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increase dose of
   AlOH. If renal fxn worsens, consider biopsy
   - Will consider HD, per family wishes, as situation is now very grave
   with worsening UOP after it had picked up over the past 2 days.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.  Ortho
   is watching right wrist and may consider repeat washout in future.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Continue slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 No plan for future procedures
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Unable to assess recently in light of intubation and
   sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on presentation.
   He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is stable.
   Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no other
   findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos yesterday
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT, uremia and DIC.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for today; will defer this
   issue until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns, monitor areas of peripheral
   necrosis
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. NGT placed. Tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line d/c
d [**3-17**] (placed
   [**2174-3-11**]), RUE PICC (placed [**3-17**])
   .
   # Code: DNR.  OK to re-intubate. Okay to turn off AICD if firing
   repetitively.
   .
   # Communication: Patient,  Wife
   .
   # Disposition: Requires ICU level of care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer.
- The patient presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and MSSA bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure.
- The patient's hemodynamic instability was initially managed with amiodarone. He converted to sinus rhythm post-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and has remained in sinus rhythm after electrolyte correction.
- The patient's respiratory failure is due to a subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and fluid retention. He was electively intubated for multiple procedures and had difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
- The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, possibly due to metastatic seeding of gouty joints and suspected endocarditis. Additional data includes worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of the left foot.
- The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is likely pre-renal initially, then tipped over to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is no evidence of analgesic-induced nephropathy (AIN) or hydronephrosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient, which was controlled
   with amiodarone.  Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI
   bleed and colon cancer.  Patient has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on
   [**3-11**] that showed no clot.  Patient converted to NSR post-TEE in the
   setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in NSR after electrolyte
   correction.  Appreciate assistance from EP. Appears to have gone back
   into a-fib in the AM of [**3-18**] in setting of hypoxemia.
   - EKG in AM
   - Fluid boluses  and metoprolol IV x1 to attempt cardioversion, will
   speak with family re: cardioversion/TEE for presumed endocarditis
   - continue amiodarone per NG, consider rebolus as hemodynamics improve
   when patient is in NSR, if family wishes
   - notify EP when patient stable and leaving the unit to repeat
   assessment of his device (note they changed his baseline pacing rate to
   60 bpm on [**3-11**]).
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**]. Pt more alert. Pt is
   17L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube feeds
   held overnight.
   - re-intubated for worsening acidosis and hypoventilation with fatigue
   overnight
   - Will speak with family regarding long-term ventilator assist as it
   may be increasingly difficult to wean patient in light of recent
   decline.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 treat hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increase dose of
   AlOH. If renal fxn worsens, consider biopsy
   - Will consider HD, per family wishes, as situation is now very grave
   with worsening UOP after it had picked up over the past 2 days.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.  Ortho
   is watching right wrist and may consider repeat washout in future.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Continue slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 No plan for future procedures
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Unable to assess recently in light of intubation and
   sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on presentation.
   He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is stable.
   Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no other
   findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos yesterday
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT, uremia and DIC.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for today; will defer this
   issue until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns, monitor areas of peripheral
   necrosis
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. NGT placed. Tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line d/c
d [**3-17**] (placed

   .
   # Code: DNR.  OK to re-intubate. Okay to turn off AICD if firing
   repetitively.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presented with new onset atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. The patient also has respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF).

Medical Complications:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient initially presented with AFib with RVR, which was controlled with amiodarone. It is likely not a candidate for warfarin given recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and colon cancer. The patient converted to sinus rhythm post-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the setting of hyperkalemia and has remained in sinus rhythm after electrolyte correction. However, the patient went back into AFib in the morning of [**3-18**] in the setting of hypoxemia.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient presented with a subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a decline over the past 3-4 weeks. He was electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures. Difficulty weaning the patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention and baseline COPD. The patient was extubated in the afternoon of [**3"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure. After family meeting yesterday, family
   decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, however not
   CMO. Will continue pressors for BP support and low-dose morphine gtt
   for pain control. Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 242**]
s note from yesterday for
   details.
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes given gravity of pt
s overall
   condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM
   for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis. Pt
   is 20L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube
   feeds held overnight.
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.

   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer presenting with new onset atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's overall goal of care is to continue pressors for blood pressure support and low-dose morphine drip for pain control. The patient's family has decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, but not officially code status.

The patient initially presented with A. Fib with RVR and appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) post-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the setting of hyperkalemia and remained in NSR after electrolyte correction. Then, the patient reverted back to A. fib yesterday morning but converted to SR with intravenous amiodarone. The patient was hemodynamically better when in NSR. It is likely that the patient is not a candidate for warfarin given recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and colon cancer. The patient has ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction (MI). A TEE on [**3-11**] showed no clot.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure. After family meeting yesterday, family
   decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, however not
   CMO. Will continue pressors for BP support and low-dose morphine gtt
   for pain control. Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 242**]
s note from yesterday for
   details.
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes given gravity of pt
s overall
   condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**]. Pt more alert. Pt is
   17L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube feeds
   held overnight.
   - re-intubated for worsening acidosis and hypoventilation with fatigue
   overnight
   - Will speak with family regarding long-term ventilator assist as it
   may be increasingly difficult to wean patient in light of recent
   decline.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 treat hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increase dose of
   AlOH. If renal fxn worsens, consider biopsy
   - Will consider HD, per family wishes, as situation is now very grave
   with worsening UOP after it had picked up over the past 2 days.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.  Ortho
   is watching right wrist and may consider repeat washout in future.
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Continue slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - F/u ortho recs
 No plan for future procedures
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Unable to assess recently in light of intubation and
   sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on presentation.
   He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is stable.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of colon cancer, atrial fibrillation, and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator. He was admitted with multiple septic joints, renal failure, respiratory failure, and sepsis. The patient failed extubation and developed a cold left foot. The family has decided against further aggressive care, opting for terminal extubation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.1°C (95.2°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/27 to 133/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O.

The patient has absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, with necrotic toes on the left foot. Neurologic examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, but movement, tone, and other assessments are not performed due to his critical condition.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, and potassium levels. The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure. After family meeting yesterday, family
   decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, however not
   CMO. Will continue pressors for BP support and low-dose morphine gtt
   for pain control. Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 242**]
s note from yesterday for
   details.
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes given gravity of pt
s overall
   condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM
   for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis. Pt
   is 20L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube
   feeds held overnight.
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 treat hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increase dose of
   AlOH. No hemodialysis or biopsy as pt does not want aggressive
   interventions.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - family does not wish any further procedures
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Continue slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - Appreciate ortho recs
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Unable to assess recently in light of intubation and
   sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on presentation.
   He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is stable.
   Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no other
   findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos [**3-17**]
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT and low-grade DIC.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for [**3-16**]; will defer this issue
   until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns, monitor areas of peripheral
   necrosis
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. NGT placed. Tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: A-line ([**2174-3-11**]), and R IJ central line d/c
d [**3-17**] (placed
   [**2174-3-11**]), RUE PICC (placed [**3-17**])

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation (A. fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's overall goal of care is to continue with pressors for blood pressure support and low-dose morphine for pain control. The family has decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, but not the comfort measures.

Hemodynamic instability: The patient initially presented with A. fib with RVR, which appears to be a new diagnosis. He converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) post-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the setting of hyperkalemia and remained in NSR after electrolyte correction. However, he went back into A. fib the previous evening despite continuing amiodarone. The patient is likely not a candidate for coumadin given his recent gastrointestinal bleed and colon cancer. He has ruled out for an MI, and a TEE on [**3-11**] showed no clot. The plan is to switch IV amiodarone to oral and turn off the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) per family wishes"

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided progress note. However, there are several significant events and findings that can help in understanding the patient's condition.

- On 3-14, BACTEROIDES FRAGILIS was detected, indicating a bacterial infection. The family wants to wait until Monday to discuss the plan of care with the attending physician.
- The patient's last dose of antibiotics was cefipime on 3-19 at 08:00 PM, ciprofloxacin on 3-19 at 08:00 PM, and metronidazole on 3-20 at 02:00 AM.
- The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate and phenylephrine infusions.
- Vital signs show a low body temperature (hypothermia) and low blood pressure (hypotension).
- Hemodynamic monitoring reveals an imbalance in fluid intake and output, indicating possible fluid overload or renal dysfunction.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate, tidal volume, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The respiratory system compliance and resistance indices are within normal limits.
- Physical examination findings are mostly not assessed, suggesting limited patient responsiveness or inadequate assessment.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as low calcium and albumin levels. The platelet count is within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall adult with a history of being intubated, opening eyes to name, following simple commands, and experiencing pain throughout the body. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 72 bpm with a range of 58-72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/33 mmHg to 168/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 16-20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 100%. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema, necrotic toes on the right foot, and a mottled left foot with decreased pulses and a shallow ulcer on the dorsal foot. 

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, glucose, and lactate, as well as decreased levels of platelets and albumin. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. 

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, fluids, and respiratory support through mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and presence of Bacteroides fragilis indicate a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure. After family meeting yesterday, family
   decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, however not
   CMO. Will continue pressors for BP support and low-dose morphine gtt
   for pain control. Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 242**]
s note from yesterday for
   details.
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes given gravity of pt
s overall
   condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM
   for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis. Pt
   is 20L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube
   feeds held overnight.
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs (consider TEE in [**1-7**] weeks and CT torso when feasible)
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 treat hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increase dose of
   AlOH. No hemodialysis or biopsy as pt does not want aggressive
   interventions.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - family does not wish any further procedures
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Continue slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - Appreciate ortho recs
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Unable to assess recently in light of intubation and
   sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on presentation.
   He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is stable.
   Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no other
   findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos [**3-17**]
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT and low-grade DIC.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for [**3-16**]; will defer this issue
   until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns, monitor areas of peripheral
   necrosis
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. NGT placed. Tube feeds.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: HSC, pneumoboots, PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. The patient also has respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient initially presented with A. Fib with RVR but converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) post-transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the setting of hyperkalemia and remained in NSR after electrolyte correction. He then reverted back to A. Fib yesterday morning but converted to SR with intravenous amiodarone (IV amio). The patient is hemodynamically better when in NSR. He is not a candidate for warfarin (Coumadin) due to recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and colon cancer. The patient has ruled out the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). A TEE on 3/11 showed no clot. The switch from IV amio to oral amiodarone (PO) and discontinuation of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) have been discussed with the family due to the patient's overall condition. The family has declined further aggressive care or interventions, except for continued"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure. After family meeting yesterday, family
   decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, however not
   CMO. Will continue pressors for BP support and low-dose morphine gtt
   for pain control. Please see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 242**]
s note from yesterday for
   details.
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - Appears to be in NSR but many PVCs
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes given gravity of pt
s overall
   condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM
   for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis. Pt
   is 20L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube
   feeds held overnight.
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs : will likely forego TEE and CT torso
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 treat hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increase dose of
   AlOH. No hemodialysis or biopsy as pt does not want aggressive
   interventions.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - family does not wish any further procedures
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Continue slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - Appreciate ortho recs
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Unable to assess recently in light of intubation and
   sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on presentation.
   He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is stable.
   Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no other
   findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.

   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT and low-grade DIC.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for [**3-16**]; will defer this issue
   until pt extubated and stabilized.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. The patient presents with new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and MSSA bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure.

The overall goal of care is to provide comfort and support as the patient is gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension, ARF, and respiratory failure. The family has decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, but not cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The plan includes continuing pressors for BP support, low-dose morphine for pain control, and monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to an exacerbation of COPD and fluid retention. The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator indicates difficulty in managing respiratory function. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient likely initially had pre-renal acute kidney injury which progressed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is important to continue renal monitoring, manage electrolyte imbalances, and address hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increased AlOH dose. Renal dosing of medications should also be considered.

3. Bacteremia and septic arthritis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure. After family meeting yesterday, family
   decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, however not
   CMO. Will continue pressors for BP support and low-dose morphine gtt
   for pain control.
   - Will continue to speak with family re: goals of care
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - Appears to be in NSR but many PVCs
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes given gravity of pt
s overall
   condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM
   for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis. Pt
   is 20L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube
   feeds held overnight.
   - Titrate up pain meds as patient still in pain uncomfortable on the
   vent
   - Will f/u ABG this AM
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs : will likely forego TEE and CT torso
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 treat hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increase dose of
   AlOH. No hemodialysis or biopsy as pt does not want aggressive
   interventions.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - family does not wish any further procedures
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Continue slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - Appreciate ortho recs
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Stable. Unable to assess recently in light of
   intubation and sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is
   stable.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no
   other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos [**3-17**]
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT and low-grade DIC.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for [**3-16**]; will defer this issue
   until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns, monitor areas of peripheral
   necrosis
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. Tube feeds via NGT.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: No HSC pneumoboots, PPI

","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer who presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient was initially presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The patient converted to sinus rhythm post-transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the setting of hyperkalemia and remained in sinus rhythm after electrolyte correction. However, the patient converted back into atrial fibrillation yesterday morning but was successfully converted back into sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone. The patient has been hemodynamically better when in sinus rhythm. The patient is unlikely to be a candidate for warfarin given recent gastrointestinal bleeding and colon cancer. The patient has ruled out the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. A TEE was performed on [3-11] that showed no clot. The patient appears to be in normal sinus rhythm but has multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Switch IV amiodarone to oral and turn off the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) per family wishes due to the patient's overall condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure.  Continuing pressors for BP support and
   low-dose morphine gtt for pain control.
   - Will meet with family again today re: goals of care
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - Appears to be in NSR but many PVCs
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes on [**3-18**] given gravity of pt
   overall condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM
   for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis. Pt
   is over 20L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**]) for
   - MSSA bacteremia, Enterobacter in sputum, and B. fragilis in blood.
   - ID signed-off : will likely forego TEE and CT torso as family moving
   toward CMO
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Treating hyperphosphatemia with CaCO3 and lanthanum, will titrate up
   doses.  No hemodialysis or biopsy as pt does not want aggressive
   interventions.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - family does not wish any further procedures
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Steroid taper started [**3-14**], now off
   - Appreciate ortho recs
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Stable. Unable to assess recently in light of
   intubation and sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam over the last weekend
   which is stable.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos [**3-17**]
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT and low-grade DIC.
   - hct down to 19 this morning, will discuss goals of care with family
   today and decide whether to transfuse based on that.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for [**3-16**]; will defer this issue
   until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns, monitor areas of peripheral
   necrosis
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Steroid taper
   finished, will stop insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure.

The patient initially presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which appears to be a new diagnosis. He converted to normal sinus rhythm post-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the setting of hyperkalemia and remained in normal sinus rhythm after electrolyte correction. However, he reverted back to atrial fibrillation the next day morning but converted to sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone. He is hemodynamically better when in normal sinus rhythm. The patient has ruled out the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction. A TEE performed on [**3-11**] showed no clot.

The patient also presented with a subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a decline over the past 3-4 weeks. He was electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures. Due to fluid retention and baseline COPD, the patient initially had difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure. After family meeting yesterday, family
   decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, however not
   CMO. Will continue pressors for BP support and low-dose morphine gtt
   for pain control.
   - Will continue to speak with family re: goals of care
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - Appears to be in NSR but many PVCs
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes given gravity of pt
s overall
   condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM
   for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis. Pt
   is 20L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube
   feeds held overnight.
   - Titrate up pain meds as patient still in pain uncomfortable on the
   vent
   - Will f/u ABG this AM
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**])
   - F/u final BCx and speciation/sensi studies to further tailor abx.
   - F/u ID recs : will likely forego TEE and CT torso
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal c/s
 treat hyperphosphatemia with Renagel and increase dose of
   AlOH. No hemodialysis or biopsy as pt does not want aggressive
   interventions.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - family does not wish any further procedures
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Continue slow taper of steroids started [**3-14**]
   - Appreciate ortho recs
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Stable. Unable to assess recently in light of
   intubation and sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam over the weekend which is
   stable.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no
   other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a bilary process,
   bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process related to his
   colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos [**3-17**]
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT and low-grade DIC.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for [**3-16**]; will defer this issue
   until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns, monitor areas of peripheral
   necrosis
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Continue
   humalog sliding scale q6h for now, given steroids.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, ISS. Tube feeds via NGT.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: No HSC pneumoboots, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's family has decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient initially presented with A. Fib with RVR and converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) post-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the setting of hyperkalemia. However, he converted back to A. Fib yesterday AM but was successfully converted to SR with IV amiodarone. Hemodynamic instability continues to be a concern.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient presented with a subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures. Difficulty in weaning the patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention and baseline COPD led to re-intubation on [**3-18**] AM. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation.
3. Fever/bacteremia: Blood cultures showed MSSA in the setting of metastatic seeding of gouty"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, bacteremia, septic arthritis, gout, abdominal pain, anemia, and pressure ulcers. The patient has been intubated multiple times due to difficulty weaning off the ventilator and worsening respiratory condition. He has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, likely due to metastatic seeding of gouty joints, and has necrosis of toes and mottling of the left foot. The patient's condition is described as ""gravely ill"" with multiple organ dysfunction, and the family has decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of underlying COPD and fluid retention. Intubation has been attempted multiple times, but the patient remains on mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute kidney injury. This may be pre-renal initially, followed by acute tubular necrosis. The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function.
3. Bacteremia and Septic Arthritis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which may have resulted in septic arthritis in multiple joints. Orthopedic intervention was considered, but"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure. After family meeting yesterday, family
   decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions, however not
   CMO. Will continue pressors for BP support and low-dose morphine gtt
   for pain control.
   - Will continue to speak with family re: goals of care
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - Appears to be in NSR but many PVCs
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes given gravity of pt
s overall
   condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM
   for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis. Pt
   is 20L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.  Tube
   feeds held overnight.
   - Titrate up pain meds as patient still in pain uncomfortable on the

   - Will f/u ABG this AM
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF). The overall goal of care is to continue pressors for blood pressure support and low-dose morphine for pain control, as the patient's family has decided to forego further aggressive care or interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient initially presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which appears to be a new diagnosis. He converted to normal sinus rhythm post-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the setting of hyperkalemia and remained in normal sinus rhythm after electrolyte correction. However, he converted back to atrial fibrillation yesterday morning but was successfully converted to sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone. He is likely not a candidate for warfarin due to recent gastrointestinal bleeding and colon cancer. The patient has ruled out the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). A TEE on [date] showed no clot, but the patient remains in normal sinus rhythm with many premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male admit with history of colon CA, new A-fib and now with MSSA
   bacteremia and multiple joints seeded with intervention x2 for knee
   joint infection.  He now has persistent ventilatory failure and
   persistent renal failure and evidence of impaired peripheral perfusion.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with continued A/C support
   -Advance ETT by 3 cm today
   -Continue A/C support for now
   2)Sepsis/MSSA Bactermia-
   -Has had multiple drainage procedures
   -Had initial Rx with Nafcillin but GNRs complicating course
   -ABX currently expanded to Cefepime/Cipro/Flagyl
   3)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -AICD off
   -Will continue to support with current medications
   -
   3)Renal Failure-Concern for pre-renal + ATN + possible AIN
   -Ca++ continued
   -Minimize fluid excess
   -Dialysis not being pursued based upon minimal chance of any
   expectation for return of functional status consistent with patients
   minimum goals for quality of life
   4)Colon Ca-
   -Likely contributing to current findings of anemia
   -Has persistent low HCT at this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of colon cancer, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and MSSA bacteremia with multiple joint infections. He is currently experiencing persistent ventilatory failure, persistent renal failure, and impaired peripheral perfusion. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/36 to 181/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low total CO2, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows a poor-quality chest X-ray with an endotracheal tube positioned 7 cm above the carina. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has continued assisted/controlled (A/C) support, and the endotracheal tube has been advanced by 3 cm. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilatory support are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Sepsis/MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has been treated with multiple drainage procedures and antibiotic therapy, initially with Nafcillin but switched to Cefepime, Cipro, and Flagyl due to gram-negative rod contamination. It is essential to monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and continue appropriate infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presented with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   complicated with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure.  Continuing pressors for BP support and
   low-dose morphine gtt for pain control.
   - Will meet with family again today re: goals of care
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Has been in and out of
   a fib during his hospital stay. In NSR with many PVCs currently, with
   PO amio. Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  TEE on [**3-11**] showed no clot
   - Continue PO Amio.
   - AICD turned off per family wishes on [**3-18**] given gravity of pt
   overall condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures. COPD.
   Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM for increased work
   of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis.
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).  WBC count higher today.
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**]) for MSSA
   bacteremia, Enterobacter in sputum, and B. fragilis in blood.
   - Ask ID whether Cipro can be stopped
   - Will add fluconazole for fungal coverage given worsening of
   leukocytosis
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Treating hyperphosphatemia with CaCO3 and lanthanum, will titrate up
   doses.  No hemodialysis or biopsy as pt does not want aggressive
   interventions.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - family does not wish any further procedures
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Steroid taper started [**3-14**], now off
   - Appreciate ortho recs
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Stable. Difficult to assess due to intubation and
   sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on presentation.
   He had mild discomfort on exam over the last weekend which is stable.
   Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the gallbladder, no other
   findings noted.  RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis. Pain
   could be secondary to a bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal
   abscess), or some other process related to his colon cancer.  Also
   having high residuals on tube feeds. Likely has functional ileus due to
   high amounts of morphine that patient is receiving.
   - check KUB for ileus
   - Repeat LFTs.
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos [**3-17**]. Received 1 u pRBCs yesterday for Hct 19 with
   appropriate bump in Hct.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. The patient's condition has complicated with respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
- Heart rate: 62 beats per minute
- Blood pressure: 108/31 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, Zosyn, nafcillin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The most recent doses of these medications were administered on 03/21/2023 at 08:00 PM, 09:30 PM, and 04:00 AM, respectively.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. His electrolyte levels are also imbalanced.

The patient's physical examination reveals the presence of conjunctival pallor, a systolic murmur"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure.  Continuing pressors for BP support and
   low-dose morphine gtt for pain control.
   - Will meet with family again today re: goals of care
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - Appears to be in NSR but many PVCs
   - switch IV amio to PO

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer.
- He presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.
- The patient has been in the ICU since [**2174-3-11**] for multiple procedures and has been intubated due to fluid retention and baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- He developed bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and has been treated with ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and metronidazole.
- The patient has septic arthritis combined with gouty arthritis in multiple joints and has undergone washout and joint tapping.
- He also has a mass lesion on the left kidney seen on a CT scan.
- The patient's condition is complicated by anemia, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding from colon cancer and anemia of chronic disease.
- He has pressure ulcers, hyperglycemia, glaucoma, and requires tube feeds through a nasogastric tube (NGT).
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition requires ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's new-onset atrial fibrillation may lead to hemodynamic instability and the risk of embolic events such as stroke.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, leading to further deterioration in his condition.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease and require dialysis.
4. Bacteremia and Sepsis: The presence of MSSA bacteremia increases the risk of sepsis and associated complications such as septic shock and organ dysfunction.
5. Septic Arthritis/Gouty Arthritis: The patient's septic arthritis combined with gouty arthritis can lead to joint destruction and systemic complications.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's pressure ulcers increase the risk of infection and can lead to complications such as cellulitis or osteomyelitis.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen his overall condition and increase the risk of complications during surgical procedures or medical interventions.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state if not properly managed.
9. Glaucoma: The patient's glaucoma can lead to vision loss if not managed appropriately.
10. Colon Cancer: The patient's colon cancer may progress and metastasize, leading to further complications and a poorer prognosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presented with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   complicated with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure.  Continuing pressors for BP support and
   low-dose morphine gtt for pain control.
   - Will meet with family again today re: goals of care
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Has been in and out of
   a fib during his hospital stay. In NSR with many PVCs currently, with
   PO amio. Likely not a candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and
   colon cancer.  TEE on [**3-11**] showed no clot
   - Continue PO Amio.

   having high residuals on tube feeds. Likely has functional ileus due to
   high amounts of morphine that patient is receiving.
   - check KUB for ileus
   - Repeat LFTs.
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and recently diagnosed colon cancer. The patient presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and MSSA bacteremia, now complicated with respiratory failure and acute renal failure.

The patient's overall goal of care is to continue pressors for blood pressure support and low-dose morphine for pain control. The patient's family will meet again to discuss the goals of care.

Hemodynamic instability: The patient initially presented with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. The patient has been in and out of atrial fibrillation during his hospital stay. He is currently in sinus rhythm with many premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and is on oral amiodarone (PO amio). He is unlikely to be a candidate for warfarin given his recent gastrointestinal bleed and colon cancer. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) on 3/11 showed no clot.

Respiratory failure: The patient presented with a subacute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a decline over the past 3-4 weeks. He was electively intubated on 3/11 to perform multiple procedures. He was extubated in the afternoon of 3/17 but reintubated on 3/18 AM for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis.

Fever/bacteremia: Blood cultures showed MSSA in the setting of metastatic seeding of gouty joints likely due to endocarditis. Additional data includes worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of the left foot. Blood cultures from an aerobic bottle on 3/14 showed Gram-negative rods (GNR). Sputum also showed Enterobacter cloacae, which is sensitive to cefepime and ciprofloxacin, likely representing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The white blood cell count is higher today.

Switched antibiotics from nafcillin (received 6 days worth,  Date range (1) 4714) to ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and metronidazole (started evening of 3/15) for MSSA bacteremia, Enterobacter in sputum, and B. fragilis in blood. Ask ID whether ciprofloxacin can be stopped. Will add fluconazole for fungal coverage given worsening leukocytosis. Follow-up pending microbiology studies.

Acute renal failure (ARF): Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). No urine eosinophils, thus unlikely allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT scan. Mass lesion on the"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF, and recently diagnosed colon cancer
   who presents with new onset A. Fib with RVR and MSSA bacteremia, now
   with respiratory failure and ARF.
   .
   # Overall goal of care: Pt gravely ill, with bacteremia, hypotension,
   ARF and respiratory failure.  Continuing pressors for BP support and
   low-dose morphine gtt for pain control.
   - Will meet with family again today re: goals of care
   .
   # Hemodynamic instability: Initially presented with A. Fib with RVR
   appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. Patient converted to
   NSR post-TEE in the setting of hyperkalemia, and remained in NSR after
   electrolyte correction. Then back in A. fib yesterday AM but converted
   to SR with IV amio. Hemodynamically better when in NSR. Likely not a
   candidate for coumadin given recent GI bleed and colon cancer.  Patient
   has ruled out for an MI. Had TEE on [**3-11**] that showed no clot.
   - Appears to be in NSR but many PVCs
   - switch IV amio to PO
   - AICD turned off per family wishes on [**3-18**] given gravity of pt
   overall condition. Appreciate EP help.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Presented with subacute exacerbation with
   decline over past 3-4 weeks.  Has COPD at baseline. Patient was
   electively intubated on [**3-11**] to perform multiple procedures.  Difficulty
   weaning patient from the ventilator initially due to fluid retention
   and baseline COPD. Extubated afternoon of [**3-17**] but re-intubated [**3-18**] AM
   for increased work of breathing and tachypnea, worsening acidosis. Pt
   is over 20L positive over LOS however will not diurese given ARF.
   - Continue mech ventilation until further direction from family.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia:  Blood cultures 3/4 MSSA in setting of metastatic
   seeding of gouty joints
 likely due to endocarditis. Additional data
   is worsening necrosis of toes and mottling of L foot. BCx from anerobic
   bottle on [**3-14**] showing GNR. Sputum also showing enterobacter cloacae
   (sensitive to cefepime and cipro), likely representing VAP (however
   mini-BAL negative).
   - Switched abx from nafcillin (received 6 days
 worth, [**Date range (1) 4714**]), to
   Cipro, Cefepime and Flagyl (started evening of [**3-15**]) for
   - MSSA bacteremia, Enterobacter in sputum, and B. fragilis in blood.
   - ID signed-off : will likely forego TEE and CT torso as family moving
   toward CMO
   - f/u pending micro studies
   .
   # ARF: Most likely, initially pre-renal then tipped over to ATN. No
   urine eos, thus unlikely AIN due to nafcillin. No hydronephrosis per CT
   scan.  Mass lesion on the left previously seen on CT done [**2174-2-6**] at
   BIDN. Cr now somewhat stable in 4+ range.
   - Trend lytes
   - Treating hyperphosphatemia with CaCO3 and lanthanum, will titrate up
   doses.  No hemodialysis or biopsy as pt does not want aggressive
   interventions.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Septic arthritis / gout: Patient septic arthritis combined with gouty
   arthritis in multiple joints.  Orthopedics took patient to the OR for
   washout on [**3-12**] and all joints tapped have bacteria on gram stain.
   Assistance and recs from ortho and rheum are much appreciated.
   - family does not wish any further procedures
   - colchicine off given elevated creatinine
   - Steroid taper started [**3-14**], now off
   - Appreciate ortho recs
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Stable. Unable to assess recently in light of
   intubation and sedation. The patient did not have any abdominal pain on
   presentation.  He had mild discomfort on exam over the last weekend
   which is stable.  Abdominal ultrasound also noted sludge in the
   gallbladder, no other findings noted.  Pain could be secondary to a
   bilary process, bacteremia (?abdominal abscess), or some other process
   related to his colon cancer.
   - Trend LFTs
 elevated Tbili, other LFTs and lipase nl
   - RUQ U/S showing cholelithiasis, no cholecystitis.
   .
   # Anemia: likely GIB from colon cancer and anemia of chronic dz.
   Patient transfused with 1 unit on am of [**3-13**] and 2 U [**3-14**]. Haptoglobin
   not decreased and LDH not largely elevated, so hemolysis less likely.
   Guaiac pos [**3-17**]
   - per BIDN records, baseline Hct 35-37.
   - goal Hct >22; judicious RBC transfusions.
   - Also exhibiting platelet drop, which might be multifactorial,
   including HIT and low-grade DIC.
   - hct down to 19 this morning, will discuss goals of care with family
   today and decide whether to transfuse based on that.
   .
   # Colon Ca: No known mets but with extensive lymphadenopathy in chest
   on last CT scan.
   - had a colorectal outpt appt scheduled for [**3-16**]; will defer this issue
   until pt extubated and stabilized.
   .
   # Pressure Ulcers:
   - local wound care, frequent turns, monitor areas of peripheral
   necrosis
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: no h/o diabetes by chart.  HbA1c 6.7.  Steroid taper
   finished, will stop insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Glaucoma: continue eye drops
   - confirm pilocarpine dosing from outpatient setting.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and recently diagnosed colon cancer. He presents with new onset atrial fibrillation (A. Fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, now with respiratory failure and acute renal failure (ARF).

The overall goal of care is to continue pressors for blood pressure support and low-dose morphine for pain control. The patient is hemodynamically unstable, initially presenting with A. Fib with RVR, which appears to be a new diagnosis for this patient. The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) post-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the setting of hyperkalemia and remained in NSR after electrolyte correction. However, the patient reverted back to A. Fib yesterday morning but converted to SR with intravenous amiodarone (IV amio). The patient is likely not a candidate for coumadin due to recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and colon cancer.

The patient has ruled out the possibility of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). A TEE performed on [**3-11**] showed no clot. The patient appears to be in NSR but has multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). It is"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y male with diffuse bactermia and sepsis with multiple metastatic
   foci of infection and now with persistent compromise of ventilation,
   renal function, hypotension and mental status.
   Sepsis-
   -Cefepime/Cipro/Flagyl to continue for bacterial infection
   -Will attempt to wean neo as possible but with persistent requirements
   for pressors and rising WBC count is concerning for recurrent
   infection.
   -Fungal infection is reasonable to consider as possible source and will
   look to cultures
   -If neo requirement persistent will consider Levophed as alternative.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])-
   -Will continue with CMV support at current levels.
   Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Will continue with Amiodarone Rx
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-
   -Persistent impairment in clearance
   -Continue to support
   VOMITING/NAUSEA-
   -Will look to KUB and LFT
s for eval of possible GB involvement and
   bowel obstruction
   -Will pursue fungal cultures given high risk at this time.
   -For further significant clinical decline will start empiric Rx with
   Fluconazole
 ICU Care-Patient
s family in for full discussion.  Persistence of
   hypotensive insult in the setting of prolonged antibiotic therapy would
   suggest incapacity to clear infection and with persistence of impaired
   perfusion both impaired renal function and impaired perfusion of
   extremities is suggested.  This, in the setting of persistent
   ventilatory failure is a picture of persistent multi-organ system
   failure.  This does not include the issue of recent diagnosis of colon
   cancer.  Given his baseline goals of return to independent function and
   his previously expressed wishes of not being maintained on machines
   without expectation for return to baseline independent function he
   would not want continued aggressive medical care and will move in
   concert with the family
s expressed wishes on his part will consider
   move to CMO status when all have been able to visit with patient.
