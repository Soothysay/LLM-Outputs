","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of being in shock. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several tests and procedures. His vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 144 bpm, blood pressure of 85/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications including milrinone, norepinephrine, and metoprolol. His arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.30, indicating respiratory acidosis. His labs indicate anemia, elevated troponin levels, and impaired kidney function. The patient's physical examination reveals poor peripheral pulses and unresponsive neurologic status. The assessment includes cardiogenic shock, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired transfers, hypotension, liver transplant, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications for this patient include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated troponin levels suggest cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and his arterial blood gas shows respiratory acidosis. This indicates the need for immediate respiratory support and intervention to prevent further deterioration.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy and
   NTEMI.
   .
   # Shock - Cardiogenic most likely eitology.  Newly depressed EF to 10%
   most likely secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt
   had an ischemic event .  Other possibilities include a
   tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.  Patient on immunosuppression
   and so concern for infection is high.  Pt likely will not mount WBC or
   spike fever given immunosuppression.  CXR w/o e/o PNA.   Pt BP has been
   support with neo and now vasopressin.  Pt also with melena overnight
   and decrease in Hct to 25.9.
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin titrate to MAP>60
   - milrinone drip at 0.5.
   - fup cultures, will discuss initiating antibiotics given worsening
   tachycardia and hypotension.
   - goal CVP<20
   - pt started on selenium, thiamine and carnitine replacement
   .
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia - Patient was in sinus tach earlier and abrupt
   entry into most likely in an atrial tach with 1:1 conduction currently.
   - lopressor 2.5 mg IV prn to maintain HR <160
   - monitor on tele.
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on [**11-15**],
   now POD 11.  Pt continues to be very encephalopathic. LFTs remain
   stable.  Recent liver U/S shows patent blood flow.
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily
   - continue cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir and bactrim
   - liver team recommended the following labs: f/u Influenza swab, CMV VL
   & TFTs, selenium, thiamine, L-carnitine
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - continue CVVH for now during transfusion, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent a liver transplant on 11/15. He has had a prolonged hospital course and is now in the ICU for management of new cardiomyopathy and NETM.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, atrial tachycardia, liver failure due to alcoholic cirrhosis, anuric renal failure, acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, most likely secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. This is indicated by a newly depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 10% and hypotension that is not responsive to fluid resuscitation.
2. Atrial tachycardia: The patient developed atrial tachycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 160 to 180 beats per minute. It is being managed with IV lopressor to maintain heart rate below 160 bpm.
3. Liver failure: The patient has liver failure due to alcoholic cirrhosis, which was confirmed by a liver biopsy. He underwent a liver transplant on 11/15 but continues to exhibit encephalopathic symptoms.
4. Anuric renal failure: The patient has anuric renal failure,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, liver transplant, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis and is currently on milrinone, neo, TF, thiamine IV, l-carnitine, selenium acid, and vasopressin. The patient has episodes of tachycardia, hypotension, and is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding. His vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate ranging from 114 to 180 bpm and blood pressure fluctuating between 63/52 mmHg and 91/68 mmHg. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is low at 59-63%. He has a central venous pressure of 19 mmHg and a pulmonary artery pressure of 19/16 mmHg. The patient's serum creatinine has been rising, indicating worsening renal function. His blood cultures were obtained, and he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, troponin T, lactic acid, and LDH levels. The patient has impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired transfers, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with tachycardia, hypotension, and suspected infection suggests the possibility of sepsis. Prompt identification and management of the underlying infection are crucial.
2. Acute"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. The note describes various medical events that occurred over a 24-hour period in the ICU.

The patient's condition has been monitored closely with frequent measurements of vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and blood pressure is on the lower side.

The patient's hemodynamic status has been closely monitored with central venous pressure (CVP) measurements, as well as cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) calculations using Fick and Vigileo methods. The CVP has been fluctuating, indicating possible fluid shifts or ongoing fluid losses. The CO and CI values are low, suggesting inadequate cardiac function.

The patient has received several interventions, including the administration of milrinone, a medication used to improve cardiac output. The dosage of milrinone was adjusted multiple times during the day due to the declining CI values. The patient also received blood transfusions and had continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) running at a high rate to manage fluid balance and remove waste products.

There is a discussion regarding the dose adjustment of milrinone in the presence of CVVH, with differing opinions from the pharmacy team. It is mentioned that the half-life of milrinone may be prolonged during CVVH.

The patient's respiratory status has shown increasing acidosis, but their"

   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy and
   NTEMI.
   .
   # Shock - Cardiogenic most likely eitology.  Newly depressed EF to 10%
   most likely secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt
   had an ischemic event .  Other possibilities include a
   tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.  If related to transplant,
   would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive measures sufficient
   (time line unclear)
   - milrinone drip at 0.6 currently: pharmacy will get back to us
   regarding the half-life of milrinone on CVVH assuming a GFR of 30; it
   is definitely prolonged, but the question remains to what
   degree
crucial in trending cardiac index in response to our milrinone
   dose adjustments.
   - f/u cultures, will continue to discuss initiating antibiotics given
   worsening tachycardia and hypotension.
   - goal CVP: 15-20
   - pt on selenium, thiamine and carnitine replacement
   - plan to discuss case with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] this pm. Liver Transplant team
   raised question of Cardiac Transplant
   - HR control yesterday with lopressor did not seem to improve MAP or
   cardiac index. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia: would avoid rate
   control unless persistently above 170.
   .
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia - Patient was in sinus tach earlier and abrupt
   entry into most likely in an atrial tach with 1:1 conduction currently.
   Seems to alternate btw both with similar rates.
   - lopressor 2.5 mg IV prn to maintain HR <180; not necessary yesterday
   as HR generally 150-160
   - monitor on tele.
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on [**11-15**],
   now POD 12?.  Pt continues to be very. LFTs remain stable.  Recent
   liver U/S shows patent blood flow.
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily
   - continue cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - continue CVVH for now during transfusion, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30

   Portuguese is 1st language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went
   cardiac index is higher suggesting that some componenet of

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent liver transplantation on November 15th. He has been experiencing a prolonged hospital course and is currently in the ICU due to cardiomyopathy, acute respiratory failure, anemia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac index is significantly low, and he is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia. These symptoms suggest cardiogenic shock, which can be caused by post-transplant cardiomyopathy or other factors such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiency.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is slightly impaired, and he may be experiencing hepatic encephalopathy due to liver failure.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to anuric renal failure. This could be secondary to hepatorenal syndrome or other factors.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to platelet consumption or sepsis. Monitoring and transfusion of platelets may be necessary to maintain a platelet count above 50,000/mm3.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, possibly due to steroid use. He"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Milrinone weaned early in am in reponse to HR 160s to 0.3 with little
   immediate effect on CI which remained above 2 until early afternoon.
   - 1 u prbc given to achieve goal HCT of 30 and CVP~20 in effort
   - CI as calc by FICK and vigileo began to decline in afternoon. Hct
   bumped appropriately and CVVH running 150+ per hr, but CVP declining to
   12 despite these (potentially large fluuid losses in stool).
   - Milrinone increased to 0.5 again with only partial recovery of CI,
   boluses given to maintain CVP >15 (total of 3L NS in addition to net
   positive balance from CVVH/drips)
   - Milrinone then increased to 0.6, last fick 1.7-1.8, last vigileo 2.5
   - increasing resp acidosis at times, although metal status not
   significantly changed.
   - differing opinions from pharmacy re: milrinone in CVVH: per one team,
   no dose adjustment necessary, per other, CVVH half-life is 20+ hrs
   instead of 2.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant on 11/15. He is currently in the ICU for management of new cardiomyopathy and NSTEMI. The patient's medical history includes hepatorenal syndrome, hypertension, aneuric renal failure, acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy. 

The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, likely due to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. He has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 10% and is being supported with norepinephrine and vasopressin. The patient also has atrial tachycardia and is on lopressor to maintain a heart rate below 160 beats per minute.

The patient's liver function tests are stable, but he remains encephalopathic. He is on immunosuppressive medications including prednisone, cellcept, and tacrolimus. His renal function is anuric, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. He is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient has acute on chronic anemia with a hematocrit of 25.9%, and he is being transfused to maintain a goal hematocrit of greater than 30%. He has had melena overnight and a history of variceal bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy and
   NTEMI.
   .
   # Shock - Cardiogenic most likely eitology.  Newly depressed EF to 10%
   most likely secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt
   had an ischemic event .  Other possibilities include a
   tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.  If related to transplant,
   would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive measures sufficient
   (time line unclear)
   - milrinone drip at 0.6 currently: pharmacy will get back to us
   regarding the half-life of milrinone on CVVH assuming a GFR of 30; it
   is definitely prolonged, but the question remains to what
   degree
crucial in trending cardiac index in response to our milrinone
   dose adjustments.
   - f/u cultures, will continue to discuss initiating antibiotics given
   worsening tachycardia and hypotension.
   - goal CVP: 15-20
   - pt on selenium, thiamine and carnitine replacement
   - plan to discuss case with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] this pm. Liver Transplant team
   raised question of Cardiac Transplant
   - HR control yesterday with lopressor did not seem to improve MAP or
   cardiac index. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia: would avoid rate
   control unless persistently above 170.
   .
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia - Patient was in sinus tach earlier and abrupt
   entry into most likely in an atrial tach with 1:1 conduction currently.
   Seems to alternate btw both with similar rates.
   - lopressor 2.5 mg IV prn to maintain HR <180; not necessary yesterday
   as HR generally 150-160
   - monitor on tele.
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on [**11-15**],
   now POD 12?.  Pt continues to be very. LFTs remain stable.  Recent
   liver U/S shows patent blood flow.
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily
   - continue cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - continue CVVH for now during transfusion, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets low at 116 but trending up more
   recently.  last Plt transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. transfuse to keep plt>50
   .
   # Encephalopathy: per surgical team, patient at baseline mental status.
   alert, arousable to voice. intermintently following commands.
   Portuguese is 1st language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went
   cardiac index is higher suggesting that some componenet of
   encephalopathy might be hypoperfusion.
   - continue to monitor exam.

The patient's medical history includes hepatorenal syndrome, hypertension, anemia, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy.

The patient has been experiencing tachycardia with a heart rate of 180 beats per minute, hypotension, and a cardiac index of 1.6. The EKG showed ST elevation, indicating a possible ischemic event. The patient's lactate levels are elevated at 1.6 mmol/L, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is low at 34-42%. The patient's LFTs are stable, but there is a concern for post-transplant cardiomyopathy with a depressed ejection fraction of 10%.

The patient is on multiple medications including milrinone, vasopressin, phenylephrine, heparin, selenium, thiamine, carnitine, prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus, fluconazole, valganclovir, and bactrim.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, liver transplant, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient is currently in the ICU due to cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, impaired muscle performance, and impaired knowledge.
- The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate in the 160s, blood pressure ranging from 66/51 to 87/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.
- The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 19 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 34/28 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 27 mmHg.
- The patient has received multiple interventions including the placement of a PA catheter, administration of vasopressors, and adjustment of inotropic support.
- The patient's lab results indicate acute kidney injury, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated cardiac biomarkers.
- The patient's condition remains unstable, and further diagnostic and therapeutic measures are required.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's presentation suggests cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to the organs and tissues. Immediate management is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's"

   - fluid boluses 1L to keep CVP just below 20.
   - PTT 40 - Inc hep gtt to 800, (3am PTT not a true one); look at 0900
   PTT to decided on hep gtt changes.
   - LFTs trending up
   - able to wean phenylepiphrine back down to 3 with some improvement in

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy and
   NTEMI.
   .
   # Shock - Cardiogenic most likely eitology.  Newly depressed EF to 10%
   most likely secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt
   had an ischemic event .  Other possibilities include a
   tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.  If related to transplant,
   would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive measures sufficient
   (time line unclear)
   - milrinone drip at 0.6 currently: pharmacy will get back to us
   regarding the half-life of milrinone on CVVH assuming a GFR of 30; it
   is definitely prolonged, but the question remains to what
   degree
crucial in trending cardiac index in response to our milrinone
   dose adjustments.
   - f/u cultures, will continue to discuss initiating antibiotics given
   worsening tachycardia and hypotension.
   - goal CVP: 15-20
   - pt on selenium, thiamine and carnitine replacement
   - plan to discuss case with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] this pm. Liver Transplant team
   raised question of Cardiac Transplant
   - HR control yesterday with lopressor did not seem to improve MAP or
   cardiac index. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia: would avoid rate
   control unless persistently above 170.
   .
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia - Patient was in sinus tach earlier and abrupt
   entry into most likely in an atrial tach with 1:1 conduction currently.
   Seems to alternate btw both with similar rates.
   - lopressor 2.5 mg IV prn to maintain HR <180; not necessary yesterday
   as HR generally 150-160
   - monitor on tele.
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on [**11-15**],
   now POD 12?.  Pt continues to be very. LFTs remain stable.  Recent
   liver U/S shows patent blood flow.
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily
   - continue cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - continue CVVH for now during transfusion, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets low at 116 but trending up more
   recently.  last Plt transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. transfuse to keep plt>50
   .
   # Encephalopathy: per surgical team, patient at baseline mental status.
   alert, arousable to voice. intermintently following commands.
   Portuguese is 1st language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went
   cardiac index is higher suggesting that some componenet of
   encephalopathy might be hypoperfusion.
   - continue to monitor exam.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant on 11/15. He has been experiencing multiple complications post-transplant, including cardiomyopathy with a depressed ejection fraction of 10%, anuric renal failure likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, encephalopathy, and hepatic vein thrombosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 36.4°C (97.5°F), Heart rate 163 bpm, Blood pressure 80/61 mmHg, Respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 100% on nasal cannula.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 19 mmHg, Pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) 36/28 mmHg, Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 26 mmHg, Cardiac index (CI) 1.6 L/min/m2.
- Fluid balance: Total input 6,968 mL, Total output 4,310 mL, Urine output 947 mL, Stool output 317 mL, Drainage output 2,658 mL.
- Laboratory results: Hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL, Hematocrit 28.5%, Platelets 148,000/mm3, Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, Blood glucose 132 mg/dL, Liver function tests showing elevated ALT and AST levels.
- Medications: Milrinone infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, Heparin sodium infusion at 800 units/hour, Vasopressin infusion at 2.4 units/hour, Phenylephrine infusion at 3 mcg/kg/min.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to post-transplant cardiomyopathy.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome leading to anuric renal failure.
3. Hepatic vein thrombosis.
4. Thrombocytopenia.
5. Hyperglycemia.
6. Encephalopathy.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamic status, renal function, liver function, and blood glucose levels. Frequent assessments of the patient's mental status and respiratory status should also be conducted. Prompt intervention and adjustment of medications, as well as close communication with the liver transplant team, are crucial in managing the patient's complex medical condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent a liver transplant on 11/15/2145. He has been experiencing a prolonged hospital course with various complications. The patient is currently in the ICU for management of new cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. The cardiomyopathy is most likely secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. The patient is also experiencing an atrial tachycardia, liver failure due to alcoholic cirrhosis, anuric renal failure likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome, acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has a significantly decreased EF of 10%, indicating impaired cardiac function. This may lead to cardiogenic shock if not properly managed.
2. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently high, which can further compromise cardiac output and hemodynamic stability.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are drifting upwards, indicating worsening liver function. This can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and other complications related to liver failure.
4. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient has anuric renal failure, which means there is no urine output. This can progress to renal"

   positioned more distal than standard, probably within a segmental
   branch of the right pulmonary artery. Catheter could be withdrawn
   several centimeters for more optimal positioning. 2. Unchanged moderate
   right and small left pleural effusions. 3. Unchanged mild interstitial
   pulmonary edema.
   [**11-29**] TTE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <15 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in
   the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened (?#). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-11-25**] the left
   ventricular cavity is now dilated with more impaired systolic function.
   Right ventricular cavity size is now larger with more prominent free
   wall hypokinesis. The heart rate is also greater.

   effusion, small left pleural effusion and a massive amount of ascites
   within the abdomen.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**]. He has been experiencing a prolonged hospital course and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of new cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to the dilated left and right ventricles, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, and a measured EF of less than 15%. This may be secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Other possible causes include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiencies. The patient has been placed on a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to optimize cardiac output.

2. Atrial tachycardia: The patient was previously in sinus tachycardia, and there is an abrupt entry into an atrial tachycardia with 1:1 conduction. This seems to alternate between both sides with similar rates. Rate control is being avoided unless the heart rate consistently exceeds 180 beats per minute.

3. Liver failure: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and underwent a liver transplant. He now presents with liver failure, as indicated by the rising liver function tests (LFTs) and the presence of"

   severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened (?#). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-11-25**] the left
   ventricular cavity is now dilated with more impaired systolic function.
   Right ventricular cavity size is now larger with more prominent free
   wall hypokinesis. The heart rate is also greater.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy with
   EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF measured at <15%.  Believed to be secondary to post-transplant
   cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .  Other
   possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.  If
   related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive
   measures sufficient (time line unclear).  Not improved on repeat Echo.
   Now s/p LVAD
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, CVP around 20, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed
   - LVAD to optimize CO
   - f/u cultures, will continue to discuss initiating antibiotics given
   worsening tachycardia and hypotension.
   - pt on selenium, thiamine and carnitine replacement
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia - Patient was in sinus tach earlier and abrupt
   entry into most likely in an atrial tach with 1:1 conduction currently.
   Seems to alternate btw both with similar rates.  HR control yesterday
   with lopressor did not seem to improve MAP or cardiac index. Seems to
   be tolerating tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently
   above 170.
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele.
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs drifting upwards in the setting of high pressor
   requirements
   - repeat liver US to evaluate patency of vessels
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily
   - continue cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - continue CVVH for now during transfusion, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets low at 116 but trending up more
   recently.  last Plt transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The note mentions several conditions, including gastrointestinal bleed, chronic renal failure, cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory failure, impaired muscle performance, impaired knowledge, impaired range of motion, impaired transfers, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and liver transplant.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and has undergone a liver transplant. They are currently experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is indicated by low blood pressure (73/63 mmHg), sinus tachycardia (heart rate of 108 bpm), and diminished pulses in both upper and lower extremities.

The patient also has acute respiratory failure, as shown by their oxygen saturation level of 92% on a nasal cannula and an ABG result of 7.34/33/77 with a PaCO2 of 21 and a base excess of -6.

Additionally, the patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL. They also have impaired muscle performance, knowledge, range of motion, and transfers, indicating possible neurological or muscular complications.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), liver enzymes (ALT/AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin-T, indicating possible myocardial damage or other organ dysfunctions.

The patient's arterial line was started on 11/29/2145 at 02"

   [**11-29**] CXR: 1. Left IJ approach pulmonary arterial catheter tip
   positioned more distal than standard, probably within a segmental
   branch of the right pulmonary artery. Catheter could be withdrawn
   several centimeters for more optimal positioning. 2. Unchanged moderate
   right and small left pleural effusions. 3. Unchanged mild interstitial
   pulmonary edema.
   [**11-29**] TTE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF <15 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in
   the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened (?#). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-11-25**] the left
   ventricular cavity is now dilated with more impaired systolic function.
   Right ventricular cavity size is now larger with more prominent free
   wall hypokinesis. The heart rate is also greater.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy with
   EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF measured at <15%.  Believed to be secondary to post-transplant
   cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .  Other
   possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.  If
   related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive
   measures sufficient (time line unclear).  Not improved on repeat Echo.
   Now s/p LVAD placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **]
   Med Ctr, who feels patient not a candidate.
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed.
   Consider trial of weaning phenylephrine for worsening liver function
   (see below)
   - consider placement of tandem heart, for additional right-sided
   support
   - f/u cultures, will continue to discuss initiating antibiotics given
   worsening tachycardia and hypotension.
   - pt on thiamine replacement
   - will continue digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - refer EKG
s to EP, ?consider tachycardia exacerbating factor to
   cardiomyopathy.

   # Atrial tachycardia - Patient was in sinus tach earlier and abrupt
   entry into most likely in an atrial tach with 1:1 conduction currently.
   Seems to alternate btw both with similar rates.  HR control yesterday
   with lopressor has lowered BP. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia:
   would avoid rate control unless persistently above 170.
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele

   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs drifting upwards in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily
   - continue cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   Per renal, HD line would ideally be changed (has been in ~3 weeks) but
   risks currently outweigh benefits, given tenuous cardiovascular status
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - continue CVVH for now, but consider holding and seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.

   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30

   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent a liver transplant on 11/15. He is currently in the ICU due to new-onset cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. The patient's prolonged hospital course includes hepatorenal syndrome, anuric renal failure, acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to severe left and right ventricular hypokinesis and low EF. This may be secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy.
2. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has an abrupt onset of atrial tachycardia with alternating rates and 1:1 conduction. It is important to monitor the heart rate and avoid rate control unless the heart rate consistently exceeds 180 beats per minute.
3. Liver failure: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis and underwent a liver transplant on 11/15. His liver function tests (LFTs) are drifting upwards, indicating worsening liver function. Weaning phenylephrine slowly may improve transplant perfusion.
4. Anuric renal failure: The patient has anuric renal failure, most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. CVVH should be continued, but consideration should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy with
   EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF measured at <15%.  Believed to be secondary to post-transplant
   cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .  Other
   possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.  If
   related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive
   measures sufficient (time line unclear).  Not improved on repeat Echo.
   Now s/p LVAD placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **]
   Med Ctr, who feels patient not a candidate.
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed.
   Consider trial of weaning phenylephrine for worsening liver function
   (see below)
   - consider placement of tandem heart, for additional right-sided
   support
   - f/u cultures, will continue to discuss initiating antibiotics given
   worsening tachycardia and hypotension.
   - pt on thiamine replacement
   - will continue digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - refer EKG
s to EP, ?consider tachycardia exacerbating factor to
   cardiomyopathy.
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia - Patient was in sinus tach earlier and abrupt
   entry into most likely in an atrial tach with 1:1 conduction currently.
   Seems to alternate btw both with similar rates.  HR control yesterday
   with lopressor has lowered BP. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia:
   would avoid rate control unless persistently above 170.
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs drifting upwards in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily
   - continue cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   Per renal, HD line would ideally be changed (has been in ~3 weeks) but
   risks currently outweigh benefits, given tenuous cardiovascular status
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - continue CVVH for now, but consider holding and seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets stably low at 115. last Plt transfusion
   [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. transfuse to keep plt>50
   .
   # Encephalopathy: per surgical team, patient at baseline mental status.
   alert, arousable to voice. intermintently following commands.
   Portuguese is 1st language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went
   cardiac index is higher suggesting that some componenet of
   encephalopathy might be hypoperfusion.
   - continue to monitor exam.
   .
   FEN: Pt on TF.  TPN not needed, per nutrition. NPO for now, for
   possible tandem heart. If no procedure, will resume tube feeds
   .
   ACCESS: left subclavian temp dialysis
   left cordis IJ - swan in RA.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant on November 15th. He has been experiencing a prolonged hospital course and is currently in the ICU. The patient is being managed for new cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%, likely secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Other possible causes include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiency. The patient also has anuric renal failure most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome and acute on chronic anemia.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, phenylephrine, vasopressin, milrinone, pantoprazole, and digoxin. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.9°C, heart rate 168 bpm, blood pressure 74/58 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low albumin, high LDH, and abnormal electrolytes. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level.

The patient's assessment includes cardiogenic shock, atrial tachycardia, alcoholic cirrhosis with liver failure, anuric renal failure, acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thromboc"

   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF measured at <15%.  Believed to be secondary to post-transplant
   cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .  Other
   possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.  If
   related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive
   measures sufficient (time line unclear).  Not improved on repeat Echo.
   Now s/p LVAD placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **]
   Med Ctr, who feels patient not a candidate.
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed.
   Consider trial of weaning phenylephrine for worsening liver function
   (see below)
   - consider placement of tandem heart, for additional right-sided
   support
   - f/u cultures, will continue to discuss initiating antibiotics given
   worsening tachycardia and hypotension.
   - pt on thiamine replacement
   - will continue digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent liver transplantation on 11/15. He has had a prolonged hospital course and is now in the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. 

The patient is in shock, likely cardiogenic, due to left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) dilation/hypokinesis. The low ejection fraction is believed to be secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiency. 

The patient has an atrial tachycardia, which was previously in sinus tachycardia and now alternates between both with similar rates. Rate control with lopressor has been attempted, but this has lowered the blood pressure. 

The patient also has liver failure due to alcoholic cirrhosis, complicated by hepatorenal syndrome. His renal function is anuric, and he is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). 

Other medical conditions include acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy. 

The patient's current medications include heparin, phenylephrine, vasopressin, milrinone, pantoprazole, thiamine, digoxin, and various prophylactic medications. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 168 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 63-92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory values show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

The patient's plan includes monitoring hemodynamics, attempting to maintain cardiac index above 1.8, maintaining central venous pressure (CVP) in the low 20s, and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. 

The patient will continue on milrinone with phenylephrine and vasopressin as needed. A trial of weaning phenylephrine may be considered due to worsening liver function. Placement of a tandem heart for additional right-sided support may also be considered. 

The patient's family has been counseled regarding his condition, and a code status of DNR/DNI has been established."

The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant on 11/15. He has been experiencing an extended hospital stay due to post-operative complications, including cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%, anuric renal failure likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome, and liver failure. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being managed for multiple medical complications.

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, given the LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis and an LVEF consistently measured at <15%. The low-grade fever, normal WBC count, and unrevealing cultures suggest a potential septic component. However, the main cause is believed to be post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiency.

2. Atrial tachycardia: The patient's exact etiology for atrial tachycardia is unclear. It is currently being monitored, and rate control measures may be considered if the heart rate consistently exceeds 180 beats per minute.

3. Liver failure: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and underwent liver transplantation on 11/15. His liver function tests are drifting upwards, indicating worsening liver function. This may be due to high pressor requirements affecting transplant perfusion.

   [**11-30**] CXR: Worsening pulmonary edema with increasing right pleural
   effusion which is large
   [**11-30**] TTE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal
   with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF <15%). No masses or thrombi are
   seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion.
   At scan initiation the Impella device is crossing the aortic valve and
   extending to/into the inferior wall of the left ventricle. The device
   is subsequenty slight withdrawn. At the end of the study, the device
   appears to be fully within the left ventricular cavity and not to
   impede full opening of the mitral valve.
   Compared with the prior study of [**2145-11-29**] (images reviewed), the left
   ventricular cavity is slightly smaller. Biventricular systolic function
   is similar
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy with
   EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p LVAD
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Considering tandem heart assist.
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further,
   for worsening liver function (see below)
   - consider placement of tandem heart, for additional right-sided
   support
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - refer EKG
s to EP, ?consider tachycardia exacerbating factor to
   cardiomyopathy.
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was in sinus
   tach earlier and abrupt entry into most likely in an atrial tach with
   1:1 conduction currently. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia: would
   avoid rate control unless persistently above 170.
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs drifting upwards in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clotted off. Mildly more acedemic
   today. +3 liters yesterday. Per renal, HD line would ideally be changed
   (has been in ~3 weeks) but risks currently outweigh benefits, given
   tenuous cardiovascular status
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - re-start CVVH today, but consider holding and seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday,
   today down to 26. [**Month (only) 11**] have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.
   - F/u cultures
   - low threshold to start ABx if infectious picture emerges
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 70s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.

   # Encephalopathy: per surgical team, patient at baseline mental status.
   intermintently following commands.  Portuguese is 1st language.  Seems
   to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher suggesting that
   some componenet of encephalopathy might be hypoperfusion

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10121**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Continues very unstable course with borderline cardiac output despite
   Milrinone and Impella assoc with SBP 70 to 80 with SVT 160-180.   Lfts
   slightly better.  Pressors slightly lower.
   Physical Examination
   Encephalopathic.
   diffuse 3+ edema and ascites.
   Medical Decision Making
   Will continue current course with fluids to maintain CVP around 20.
   Transfuse.
   Continue CVVH.
   Will discuss code status again as liver team feels that intubation may
   be reasonable although CPR would most likely be futile.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent liver transplantation on 11/15/2145. He has had a prolonged hospital course and is currently in the ICU due to new-onset cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 15%. The patient is in shock, likely cardiogenic, with evidence of left and right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis. He also has anemia, fever, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 168 bpm (tachycardia), blood pressure ranging from 74/58 to 92/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula, and a central venous pressure (CVP) around 13-15 mmHg. The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and he requires insulin.

The patient is receiving various medications including heparin, phenylephrine, vasopressin, milrinone, pantoprazole, and others. He has multiple lines and catheters in place, including an arterial line, central venous catheter, and dialysis catheter. The patient is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. His blood culture results have been unrevealing so far.

Plan:
1. Continue hemodynamic monitoring with goals of cardiac index (CI) >1.8, CVP in the low 20s, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
2. Adjust pressor support as needed, considering weaning phenylephrine further if hemodynamics are acceptable.
3. Consider placement of a tandem heart for additional right-sided support.
4. Follow up cultures and consider starting antibiotics if there is evidence of infection.
5. Administer thiamine replacement and consider digoxin therapy.
6. Monitor and manage liver function, renal function, anemia, hyperglycemia, and thrombocytopenia accordingly.
7. Continue heparin therapy with goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 50 seconds.
8. Provide supportive care for encephalopathy, including avoiding hypoperfusion and managing electrolytes.
9. Review and discuss code status again with the family, considering the possibility of intubation for a finite period.
10. Monitor and adjust the patient's nutrition and glycemic control as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe global hypokinesis and low ejection fraction.
2. Hepatic vein thrombosis.
3. Thrombocytopenia.
4. Anemia.
5. Hyperglycemia.
6. Renal failure.
7. Infection (due to prolonged hospital stay and immunosuppression post-transplant).
8. Hepatic encephalopathy.
9. Hepatopulmonary syndrome.
10. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including chronic renal failure, who was admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on vasopressor support. The patient's vital signs indicate persistent hypotension and tachycardia. There are concerns regarding impaired muscle performance, knowledge, range of motion, and transfers. The patient has a history of liver transplant and impaired skin integrity. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal blood glucose levels. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing hemodynamic instability and multiorgan dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic shock: The patient's initial presentation suggests septic shock secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. Continued hypotension and tachycardia indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability, which can lead to further organ dysfunction.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of acute respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can result in severe lung damage and impaired gas exchange.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and the ongoing hemodynamic instability and use of nephrotoxic medications can worsen renal function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or further deterioration of renal function.
4. Liver dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes and history of liver transplant suggest a risk of liver dysfunction,"

   Echo: [**2145-12-1**]
   The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
   There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF < 15%).  The
   impella device tip appears to be inferior to the mitral valve in the
   region of the chordae (similar to the ending position in yesterday's
   study).
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy with
   EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p LVAD
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Considering tandem heart assist.
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - consider placement of tandem heart, for additional right-sided
   support
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - refer EKG
s to EP, ?consider tachycardia exacerbating factor to
   cardiomyopathy.
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was in sinus
   tach earlier and abrupt entry into most likely in an atrial tach with
   1:1 conduction currently. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia: would
   avoid rate control unless persistently above 170. Cardioversion is not
   an option with multiple pressors and LVAD in place
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements, but now normalizing. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clotted off. Mildly more acedemic
   today. +3 liters yesterday.  s/p replacement of HD line yesterday
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH today, but consider holding and seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday,
   today down to 26. [**Month (only) 11**] have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.
   - F/u cultures
   - f/u c.diff
   - low threshold to start ABx if infectious picture emerges
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 70s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. transfuse to keep plt>50
   .
   # Encephalopathy: per surgical team, patient at baseline mental status.
   intermintently following commands.  Portuguese is 1st language.  Seems
   to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher suggesting that
   some componenet of encephalopathy might be hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.
   .
   FEN: Pt on TF.  TPN not needed, per nutrition. NPO for now, for
   possible tandem heart. If no procedure, will resume tube feeds

The patient's liver function tests are abnormal but normalizing, indicating possible hepatic failure. He has anuric renal failure likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome and requires ongoing hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient has acute on chronic anemia and requires transfusion to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) level above 30. He also has thrombocytopenia with platelets in the 70s and requires monitoring and transfusion to maintain a platelet count above 50.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy with
   EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p LVAD
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Considering tandem heart assist.
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further,
   for worsening liver function (see below)
   - consider placement of tandem heart, for additional right-sided
   support
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - refer EKG
s to EP, ?consider tachycardia exacerbating factor to
   cardiomyopathy.
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was in sinus
   tach earlier and abrupt entry into most likely in an atrial tach with
   1:1 conduction currently. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia: would
   avoid rate control unless persistently above 170.
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs drifting upwards in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clotted off. Mildly more acedemic
   today. +3 liters yesterday. Per renal, HD line would ideally be changed
   (has been in ~3 weeks) but risks currently outweigh benefits, given
   tenuous cardiovascular status
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - re-start CVVH today, but consider holding and seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday,
   today down to 26. [**Month (only) 11**] have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.
   - F/u cultures
   - low threshold to start ABx if infectious picture emerges
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 70s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. transfuse to keep plt>50
   .
   # Encephalopathy: per surgical team, patient at baseline mental status.
   intermintently following commands.  Portuguese is 1st language.  Seems
   to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher suggesting that
   some componenet of encephalopathy might be hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.
   .
   FEN: Pt on TF.  TPN not needed, per nutrition. NPO for now, for
   possible tandem heart. If no procedure, will resume tube feeds
   .
   ACCESS: left subclavian temp dialysis
   left cordis IJ - swan in RA.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**]. He is currently in the ICU due to new cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock given his LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis, low ejection fraction (<15%), and pressor requirement. This is believed to be secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiency. If related to the transplant, spontaneous recovery may be expected with supportive measures.

2. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has an atrial tachycardia with an exact etiology unclear. It is currently well-tolerated, and rate control measures such as lopressor may be considered if the heart rate consistently exceeds 180 beats per minute.

3. Liver Failure: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and underwent liver transplantation on [**11-15**]. His liver function tests are drifting upwards, and there is a concern for worsening liver function. Phenylephrine should be weaned slowly to improve transplant perfusion.

4. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing anuric renal failure, most likely"

   Echo: [**2145-12-1**]
   The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
   There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF < 15%).  The
   impella device tip appears to be inferior to the mitral valve in the
   region of the chordae (similar to the ending position in yesterday's
   study).
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic
   cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary
   syndrome and HTN s/p liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal
   failure post-op on CVVH who has had a very prolonged hospital course.
   He is transferred to the CCU for management of new cardiomyopathy with
   EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p LVAD
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Considering tandem heart assist.
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - consider placement of tandem heart, for additional right-sided
   support
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - refer EKG
s to EP, ?consider tachycardia exacerbating factor to
   cardiomyopathy.
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was in sinus
   tach earlier and abrupt entry into most likely in an atrial tach with
   1:1 conduction currently. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia: would
   avoid rate control unless persistently above 170. Cardioversion is not
   an option with multiple pressors and LVAD in place
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements, but now normalizing. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 20mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with fluconazole, valganclovir (dose confirmed with
   pharmacy) and bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clotted off. Mildly more acedemic
   today. +3 liters yesterday.  s/p replacement of HD line yesterday
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH today, but consider holding and seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
 bumped appropriately to one unit yesterday,
   today down to 26. [**Month (only) 11**] have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.
   - F/u cultures
   - f/u c.diff
   - low threshold to start ABx if infectious picture emerges
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 70s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. transfuse to keep plt>50
   .
   # Encephalopathy: per surgical team, patient at baseline mental status.
   intermintently following commands.  Portuguese is 1st language.  Seems
   to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher suggesting that
   some componenet of encephalopathy might be hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.
   .
   FEN: Pt on TF.  TPN not needed, per nutrition. NPO for now, for
   possible tandem heart. If no procedure, will resume tube feeds

   TTE ([**2145-12-2**]): There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
   (LVEF = 10 %). RV with depressed free wall contractility. Moderate to
   severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is
   present but cannot be quantified. An Impella device is seen within the
   left ventricular cavity.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-12-1**], the
   Impella device has been adjusted off the postero-medial papillary
   muscle by approx 0.5 cm. The Impella tip now lies just below the
   coaptation point of the mitral leaflets in partial contact with mitral
   chordae tendinae.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p impella
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Tandem heart assist was considered but
   held off given that it might not change course.
   - need to remove/possibly replace impella today as the current one has
   been there for 5 days
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - aggressively replete phos
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella  in
   place
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements, but now improving. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clogged off.
   - may need to replace HD line if the line continues to be clogged today
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH today pending CVVH line status, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
s/p transfusion of 1upRBC yesterday.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - no transfusion today
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.  However, given ascites and concern for SBP, abx
   started on [**2145-12-2**]
   - continue vanc/ zosyn/ micafungin for now
   - F/u cultures
   - f/u c.diff
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 30s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - consider switch heparin to argatroban or bival
   .
   # Encephalopathy: worsening, not following commands.  Portuguese is 1st
   language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher
   suggesting that some componenet of encephalopathy might be
   hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 6972**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3287**], MD
   on:[**2145-12-3**] 10:08 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, hypertension, and liver transplant. He is currently in the ICU for management of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. 

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. His low blood pressure and the need for vasopressor support indicate this. There may also be a potential septic component, but the patient's white blood cell count is normal and cultures have been unrevealing. Pressor requirement has only minimally decreased, suggesting that the shock is secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiency. 

2. Atrial tachycardia: The exact etiology of the patient's atrial tachycardia is unclear. The patient seems to be tolerating the tachycardia, and rate control measures may not be necessary unless the heart rate consistently exceeds 180 beats per minute. Cardioversion is not an option due to the presence of multiple pressors and the Impella device in place.

3. Liver failure: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and has undergone a liver transplant. Liver function tests abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor requirements but are now improving."

","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent a liver transplant on 11/15/2145. He is currently in the ICU due to post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to the cardiomyopathy, and has a history of anuric renal failure, most likely due to hepatorenal syndrome. He also has acute on chronic anemia, low-grade fever, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy.

The patient is on multiple pressors including vasopressin, phenylephrine, and milrinone, and has an Impella device placed in the left ventricle. His cardiac index is low, and he is being closely monitored for hemodynamics. He is also receiving antibiotic prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's current medications include prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus, valganclovir, and bactrim. His recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count. The patient's blood cultures have been unrevealing, and he has received multiple blood transfusions.

The patient's overall prognosis is guarded due to his multiple organ dysfunction and poor cardiac function. The healthcare team is managing his condition with aggressive supportive measures, including"

   (LVEF = 10 %). RV with depressed free wall contractility. Moderate to
   severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is
   present but cannot be quantified. An Impella device is seen within the
   left ventricular cavity.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-12-1**], the
   Impella device has been adjusted off the postero-medial papillary
   muscle by approx 0.5 cm. The Impella tip now lies just below the
   coaptation point of the mitral leaflets in partial contact with mitral
   chordae tendinae.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p impella
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Tandem heart assist was considered but
   held off given that it might not change course.
   - need to replace impella today as the current one has been there for 5
   days
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella  in
   place
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements, but now improving. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clogged off.
   - may need to replace HD line if the line continues to be clogged today
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH today pending CVVH line status, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
s/p transfusion of 1upRBC yesterday.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - Transfuse to goal Hct >30

   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.  However, given ascites and concern for SBP, abx

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent a liver transplant on November 15th. He is currently in the ICU for management of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, likely due to the cardiomyopathy. Other possibilities include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiency. He has been placed on an Impella device to support his heart function. The patient also has liver failure, anuria renal failure (likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome), acute on chronic anemia, fever with unknown origin, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low ejection fraction and reliance on vasopressors indicate severe cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring of hemodynamics is essential to maintain adequate cardiac output and organ perfusion.

2. Infection: The patient has low-grade fever and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and cultures remain unrevealing. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.

3. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests show abnormalities, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. Monitoring of liver enzymes and close attention to drug metabolism and clearance are necessary.

4. Renal failure: The patient has anuria renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) was initiated but stopped due to line clogging. It may be necessary to replace the HD line and continue CVVH to manage renal function.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, and he has received a blood transfusion. Close monitoring of hemoglobin and consideration for further transfusions or erythropoietin stimulation may be required.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugars are elevated, possibly due to steroid use. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin therapy are necessary to maintain glycemic control.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped to the 70s. Regular monitoring of platelet levels and consideration for transfusion are important to prevent bleeding complications.

8. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is deteriorating, indicating worsening encephalopathy. Monitoring of neurologic status and adjustment of medications to reduce hepatic encephalopathy are necessary.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems. Regular communication with the transplant team and hepatology services is essential for optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p impella
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Tandem heart assist was considered but
   held off given that it might not change course.
   - need to remove/possibly replace impella today as the current one has
   been there for 5 days
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - aggressively replete phos
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella  in
   place
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements, but now improving. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clogged off.
   - may need to replace HD line if the line continues to be clogged today
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH today pending CVVH line status, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
s/p transfusion of 1upRBC yesterday.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - no transfusion today
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.  However, given ascites and concern for SBP, abx
   started on [**2145-12-2**]
   - continue vanc/ zosyn/ micafungin for now
   - F/u cultures
   - f/u c.diff
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 30s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - consider switch heparin to argatroban or bival
   .
   # Encephalopathy: worsening, not following commands.  Portuguese is 1st
   language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher
   suggesting that some componenet of encephalopathy might be
   hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant on [**2145-11-15**]. He is currently in the ICU for post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient is in shock, likely cardiogenic due to LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis, and there is a potential septic component as well. Pressor requirements have decreased minimally yesterday. Other possible causes include tachycardia or nutritional deficiencies. 

The patient has multiple complications including atrial tachycardia, liver failure (alcoholic cirrhosis - s/p liver transplant on [**11-15**]), anuric renal failure (most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome), acute on chronic anemia, fever, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis (s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery), thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy. 

Plan:
- Monitor hemodynamics with a goal CI > 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low 20s, MAP > 60
- Continue milrinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed
- Consider weaning phenylephrine further to minimize liver injury if hemodynamics are acceptable
- F/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
- C/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
- C/w thiamine replacement
- Aggressively replete phos
- Continue EPO 4000 units
- Monitor Hct daily
- Continue vanc/ zosyn/ micafungin for now
- F/u cultures
- F/u c.diff
- Continue current regimen of NPH and sliding scale for hyperglycemia
- Continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50 for hepatic vein thrombosis
- Consider switch heparin to argatroban or bival if platelet count remains low
- Continue to monitor exam for encephalopathy

   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p impella
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Tandem heart assist was considered but
   held off given that it might not change course.
   - need to remove/possibly replace impella today as the current one has
   been there for 5 days
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - aggressively replete phos
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella  in
   place
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements, but now improving. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clogged off.
   - may need to replace HD line if the line continues to be clogged today
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH today pending CVVH line status, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
s/p transfusion of 1upRBC yesterday.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - no transfusion today
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.  However, given ascites and concern for SBP, abx
   started on [**2145-12-2**]
   - continue vanc/ zosyn/ micafungin for now
   - F/u cultures
   - f/u c.diff
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 30s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - consider switch heparin to argatroban or bival

   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2589**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   His leg is warm today and pulses are dopplerable. Vascular surgery
   following.
","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant on 11/15/2145. He is currently in the ICU for management of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient has been experiencing shock, likely cardiogenic due to low ventricular function. He also has atrial tachycardia, hepatic failure secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis, anuric renal failure likely due to hepatorenal syndrome, acute on chronic anemia, fever, hyperglycemia, hepatic vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and encephalopathy.

The patient's current medications include bivalirudin, phenylephrine, milrinone, vasopressin, pantoprazole, heparin, digoxin, thiamine, and tacrolimus. He is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal blood glucose levels. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis.

The patient's plan includes monitoring hemodynamics, adjusting pressor requirements, continuing with cardiac support, managing renal failure, and treating infections. The attending physician has discussed the case with a cardiac transplant team at another hospital, who feels the patient is not a candidate for cardiac transplantation. The patient's wife has been informed of his condition and has"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p impella
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Tandem heart assist was considered but
   held off given that it might not change course.
   - need to remove/possibly replace impella today as the current one has
   been there for 5 days
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - aggressively replete phos
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella  in
   place
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. Worse today compared to [**2144-12-4**], after period of
   improvement. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clogged off.
   - may need to replace HD line if the line continues to be clogged today
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH today pending CVVH line status, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
s/p transfusion of 1upRBC yesterday.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - no transfusion today
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.  However, given ascites and concern for SBP, abx
   started on [**2145-12-2**]
   - continue vanc/ zosyn/ micafungin for now
   - F/u cultures
   - f/u c.diff
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 30s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - consider switch heparin to argatroban or bival
   .
   # Encephalopathy: worsening, not following commands.  Portuguese is 1st
   language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher
   suggesting that some componenet of encephalopathy might be
   hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.

   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent a liver transplant on [2145-11-15]. He is currently in the ICU for management of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient has been experiencing prolonged hospitalization and has had a very prolonged hospital course. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to low cardiac output and the presence of LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis. There may also be a potential septic component, but further investigation is needed. Pressor requirements have decreased minimally, suggesting that the shock is likely secondary to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Other possible causes include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiency. 

2. Atrial Tachycardia: The exact etiology of the atrial tachycardia is unclear, but it seems to be tolerable. Cardioversion is not an option due to the presence of multiple pressors and the Impella device. Monitoring the patient's heart rate and considering rate control if necessary is recommended.

3. Liver Failure: The patient has liver failure due to alcoholic cirrhosis, which led to the need for a liver transplant. LFTs abnormalities have developed in the setting of high pressor requirements. Hepatic vasculature remains patent. Slow weaning of phenylephrine is advised"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. This is indicated by low blood pressure (61/50 mmHg), high heart rate (156 bpm), and poor left ventricular ejection fraction (10%).

2. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has an atrial tachycardia with a rapid heart rate, but the exact cause is unclear. Rate control measures may be considered if the heart rate consistently exceeds 180 beats per minute.

3. Liver failure: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis and has undergone a liver transplant. There are abnormalities in liver function tests, but they are improving. The hepatic vasculature remains patent.

4. Anuric renal failure: The patient has anuric renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) was previously initiated but stopped due to line issues. 

5. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient received a blood transfusion yesterday and has a history of chronic anemia. There is concern about the impact of the Impella device on red blood cell shear stress.

6. Fever: The patient had a low-grade fever yesterday, and although cultures have been unrevealing so far, there is concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Antibiotics have been started.

7. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood sugars, which may be related to steroid use. Insulin therapy is being continued.

8. Hepatic vein thrombosis: The patient had a thrombectomy prior to surgery, indicating a history of hepatic vein thrombosis. Heparin therapy is ongoing.

9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped to the 30s. There is a history of HIT antibodies, so platelet transfusion may be avoided, and consideration is given to switching from heparin to argatroban or bivalirudin.

10. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing worsening encephalopathy and is not following commands. It is believed that hypoperfusion may be contributing to the encephalopathy, as the patient seems more alert when the cardiac index is higher.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise for the patient based on the provided information."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p impella
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Tandem heart assist was considered but
   held off given that it might not change course.
   - need to remove/possibly replace impella today as the current one has
   been there for 5 days
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - aggressively replete phos
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella  in
   place
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements, but now improving. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clogged off.
   - may need to replace HD line if the line continues to be clogged today
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH today pending CVVH line status, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
s/p transfusion of 1upRBC yesterday.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - no transfusion today
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.  However, given ascites and concern for SBP, abx
   started on [**2145-12-2**]
   - continue vanc/ zosyn/ micafungin for now
   - F/u cultures
   - f/u c.diff
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 30s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - consider switch heparin to argatroban or bival
   .
   # Encephalopathy: worsening, not following commands.  Portuguese is 1st
   language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher
   suggesting that some componenet of encephalopathy might be
   hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and complications post-liver transplant. He is currently in the ICU for management of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient is experiencing shock, likely cardiogenic due to LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis. Other possibilities include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or nutritional deficiency. The patient has been placed on an Impella device and will need to remove/possibly replace it today as it has been in place for 5 days. 

The patient also has atrial tachycardia, but the exact etiology is unclear. Rate control measures are being avoided unless the heart rate consistently exceeds 180 beats per minute. Cardioversion is not an option due to the presence of multiple pressors and the Impella device.

The patient is experiencing liver failure, most likely secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis and complications from the liver transplant. LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor requirements but are now improving. The hepatic vasculature remains patent per ultrasound.

The patient also has anuric renal failure, most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. CVVH was stopped yesterday when the line clogged off, and it may need to be replaced if the line continues to be clogged today.

The patient has acute on chronic anemia and has received a transfusion of 1 unit of red blood cells yesterday."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2145-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%.  Potential septic component given
   low grade fever, but WBC normal and cultures unrevealing. Pressor
   requirement decreased minimally yesterday. Believed to be secondary to
   post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Unlikely pt had an ischemic event .
   Other possibilities include a tachy-cardiomyopathy or nutritional def.
   If related to transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if
   supportive measures sufficient (time line unclear).  S/p impella
   placement. Case discussed with cardiac transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who
   feels patient not a candidate. Tandem heart assist was considered but
   held off given that it might not change course.
   - need to remove/possibly replace impella today as the current one has
   been there for 5 days
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - f/u cultures, low threshold to start antibiotics
   - c/w digoxin at 0.125 mg QOD
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   - aggressively replete phos
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella  in
   place
   - consider lopressor 2.5 mg if HR consistently > 180s
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. Worse today compared to [**2144-12-4**], after period of
   improvement. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S.
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, cellcept 1000mg PO BID
   - continue tacrolimus, redose daily based on level.  check tacrolimus
   level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs Q12 hours.
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH stopped yesterday when line clogged off.
   - may need to replace HD line if the line continues to be clogged today
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH today pending CVVH line status, but consider holding and
   seeing if BP improves
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
s/p transfusion of 1upRBC yesterday.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - no transfusion today
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Fever: Low-grade temp yesterday. No leukocytosis and culture data
   unrevealing to date.  However, given ascites and concern for SBP, abx
   started on [**2145-12-2**]
   - continue vanc/ zosyn/ micafungin for now
   - F/u cultures
   - f/u c.diff
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery.
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 50
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets dropped to 30s this morning. Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - consider switch heparin to argatroban or bival
   .
   # Encephalopathy: worsening, not following commands.  Portuguese is 1st
   language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher
   suggesting that some componenet of encephalopathy might be
   hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history with multiple ongoing medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient is in shock, likely due to cardiogenic causes related to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. There may be a possibility of septic shock as well, but it is currently being managed with supportive measures and close monitoring of hemodynamics.

2. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has an atrial tachycardia with an unknown exact etiology. Rate control may be considered if the heart rate consistently exceeds 180 beats per minute.

3. Liver failure: The patient has liver failure due to alcoholic cirrhosis and is post-liver transplant. Liver function test abnormalities are present, and measures are being taken to improve transplant perfusion and manage medication dosages.

4. Anuric renal failure: The patient has anuric renal failure, most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. Hemodialysis is being considered, and the current CVVH line status needs to be monitored.

5. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient has acute on chronic anemia, and blood transfusion was given yesterday. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and continued use of erythropoietin are planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2146-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%. Here, the etiology could be
   'post-transplant cmp,' tachycardiomyopathy or hypophosphatemic
   cardiomyopathy. Potential septic component given low grade fever and
   VRE in Bcx, but WBC normal. Pressor requirement in flux but on
   milrinone, phenylephrine and vasopressin as of [**2144-12-6**]. If related to
   transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive measures
   sufficient (time line unclear).
   -  S/p impella placement (Day 7 = [**2145-12-6**]). Case discussed with cardiac
   transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who feels patient not a candidate. Tandem
   heart assist was considered but held off given that it might not change
   course.
   - have inter-team meeting today (transplant, liver, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to
   discuss further management
   -patient on dapto (VRE), micafungin ([**Female First Name (un) 444**]) and [**Last Name (un) 1540**] (broad gram neg
   coverage)
   - need to remove/possibly replace impella today as the current one has
   been there for 7 days.
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - aggressively replete phos while minimizing sodium load (giving IV
   repletion today to augment PO repletion). Can give 15-30 meq q8.
   - f/u cultures
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   .
   # Hypophosphatemia: clinically important (as above). Related to
   refeeding syndrome and liver injury with regeneration. Need to replete
   aggressively to minimize hypophosphatemia-associated cardiomyopathy.
   - Replete (as above)
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella in
   place. His best responses have been to blood transfusion.

   improvement.  Improving again today.  Overall stable. Hepatic
   vasculature patent per U/S. Cellcept d/c'd on [**2144-12-5**].
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, continue tacrolimus, redose daily
   based on level.  check tacrolimus level daily at 6 am per Tx team, goal
   tacro level [**5-10**].
   - monitor LFTs daily
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH filter clotted and replaced on [**2145-12-5**]
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia: hct 32.8. hemolysis labs positive. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella. Had 1 unit yesterday [**12-5**]
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but had elevated blood
   sugars on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale. Was
   hypoglycemic to 25 on [**2144-12-5**]; resuscitated with D50 amps; likely
   related to stopped tubefeeds but could also reflect liver failure.
   Sliding scale more spaced out.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Dropped from 52 to 45 from [**12-5**] to [**12-6**]. platelets as
   low as 16 in past, Last Plt transfusion [**12-4**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - treating as HIT, continue bival
   - f/u HIT level
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery. Was on
   heparin but then may have had clot on left femoral while therapeutic on
   heparin, related to possible HIT or impella.
   - continue bivalrudin. No dosing changes while on CVVH (assume CrCl of
   30), also thrombin is responsible for 80% of metabolism
   - monitor PTT (goal 50-60+) q12, tolerating 60-65
   .
   # Encephalopathy: worsening, not following commands.  Portuguese is 1st
   language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher
   suggesting that some componenet of encephalopathy might be
   hypoperfusion

   His mixed venous saturation has risen from the 50s and is consistently
   above 60%. His Cardiac Indexis 2.2 li/min/m2 which is improved from the
   1.4 to 1.5 range. If he tolerates P2 and has improved LV function with
   a preserved CI, then Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] indicated the Impella device can be
   removed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent a liver transplant on [date]. He is currently in the ICU for management of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient is experiencing multiple complications, including cardiogenic shock, hypophosphatemia, atrial tachycardia, liver failure, anuric renal failure, acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low ejection fraction and need for multiple pressors suggest a cardiogenic shock. Immediate intervention may be required to improve cardiac function and maintain adequate blood flow.

2. Hypophosphatemia: The patient has significantly low levels of phosphate, which can contribute to cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness. Aggressive repletion of phosphate is necessary to minimize these complications.

3. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing an atrial tachycardia, which could be related to the underlying cardiac issues or other factors. Monitoring and rate control measures should be implemented to manage this condition.

4. Liver Failure: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and has undergone a liver transplant. Continued monitoring of liver function tests and appropriate management of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy are essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2146-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%. Here, the etiology could be
   'post-transplant cmp,' tachycardiomyopathy or hypophosphatemic
   cardiomyopathy. Potential septic component given low grade fever and
   VRE in Bcx, but WBC normal. Pressor requirement in flux but on
   milrinone, phenylephrine and vasopressin as of [**2144-12-6**]. If related to
   transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive measures
   sufficient (time line unclear).
   -  S/p impella placement (Day 7 = [**2145-12-6**]). Case discussed with cardiac
   transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who feels patient not a candidate. Tandem
   heart assist was considered but held off given that it might not change
   course.
   - have inter-team meeting today (transplant, liver, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to
   discuss further management
   -patient on dapto (VRE), micafungin ([**Female First Name (un) 444**]) and [**Last Name (un) 1540**] (broad gram neg
   coverage)
   - need to remove/possibly replace impella today as the current one has
   been there for 7 days.
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - aggressively replete phos while minimizing sodium load (giving IV
   repletion today to augment PO repletion). Can give 15-30 meq q8.
   - f/u cultures
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   .
   # Hypophosphatemia: clinically important (as above). Related to
   refeeding syndrome and liver injury with regeneration. Need to replete
   aggressively to minimize hypophosphatemia-associated cardiomyopathy.
   - Replete (as above)
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella in
   place. His best responses have been to blood transfusion.
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. Worse yesterday ([**12-5**]) compared to [**2145-12-4**], after period of
   improvement.  Improving again today.  Overall stable. Hepatic
   vasculature patent per U/S. Cellcept d/c'd on [**2144-12-5**].
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, continue tacrolimus, redose daily
   based on level.  check tacrolimus level daily at 6 am per Tx team, goal
   tacro level [**5-10**].
   - monitor LFTs daily
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim

   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who underwent liver transplant on 11/15/2146. He is currently in the ICU due to post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient is in shock, likely cardiogenic, and is on multiple pressors including milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin. An Impella device has been placed to support cardiac function. The patient also has hypophosphatemia, atrial tachycardia, liver failure, anuric renal failure secondary to hepatorenal syndrome, acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock due to post-transplant cardiomyopathy. Pressor requirements are in flux, and the patient is on milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin. The etiology of the cardiomyopathy could be post-transplant complications, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or hypophosphatemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Hypophosphatemia: The patient has significant hypophosphatemia, which can lead to cardiomyopathy. Aggressive repletion of phosphate is necessary to minimize hypophosphatemia-associated cardiomyopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2146-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis.
   LVEF consistently measured at <15%. Here, the etiology could be
   'post-transplant cmp,' hypophosphatemic cardiomyopathy or
   tachycardiomyopathy. Potential septic component given low grade fever
   and VRE in Bcx, but WBC normal. Pressor requirement in flux but on
   milrinone, phenylephrine and vasopressin as of [**2144-12-5**]. If related to
   transplant, would expect spontaneous recovery if supportive measures
   sufficient (time line unclear).
   OLD CARDIAC PLAN
   -  S/p impella placement (Day 6 = [**2145-12-5**]). Case discussed with cardiac
   transplant at [**Hospital **] Med Ctr, who feels patient not a candidate. Tandem
   heart assist was considered but held off given that it might not change
   course.
   SEPTIC Plan
   -patient on dapto (VRE), micafungin ([**Female First Name (un) 444**]) and [**Last Name (un) 1540**] (broad gram neg
   coverage)
   PLAN FOR [**2145-12-5**]
   - need to remove/possibly replace impella today as the current one has
   been there for 6 days. To be discussed on [**2145-12-6**]
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - aggressively replete phos while minimizing sodium load (giving IV
   repletion today to augment PO repletion). Can give 15-30 meq q8.
   - f/u cultures
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   .
   # Hypophosphatemia: clinically important (as above). Related to
   refeeding syndrome and liver injury with regeneration
   - Replete (as above)
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella  in
   place. His best responses have been to blood transfusion.
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. Worse today ([**12-5**]) compared to [**2145-12-4**], after period of
   improvement. Hepatic vasculature patent per U/S. Cellcept d/c'd on
   [**2144-12-5**].
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery & hepatology recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, continue tacrolimus, redose daily
   based on level.  check tacrolimus level daily at 6 am per Tx team.
   - monitor LFTs daily
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH line clogged on [**2145-12-4**], replaced.
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia
  [**Month (only) 11**] have shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   Had 1 unit on [**12-4**] and another [**12-5**]
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but elevated blood sugars
   on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale. Was hypoglycemic
   to 25 on [**2144-12-5**]; resuscitated with D50 amps; likely related to stopped
   tubefeeds but could also reflect liver failure
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery. Was on
   heparin but then may have had clot on left femoral while therapeutic on
   heparin, related to possible HIT or impella.
   - continue bivalrudin. No dosing changes while on CVVH (assume CrCl of
   30), also thrombin is responsible for 80% of metabolism
   - monitor PTT (goal 50-60+) q12, tolerating 60-65
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: platelets as low as 30 in past, Last Plt
   transfusion [**11-20**].  HIT ab neg in past. Dropped from 80 to 50 from [**12-4**]
   to [**12-5**].
   - cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - treating as HIT, continue bival
   .
   # Encephalopathy: worsening, not following commands.  Portuguese is 1st
   language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher
   suggesting that some componenet of encephalopathy might be
   hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent liver transplantation on November 15, 2146. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ systems.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to low cardiac output and hypotension. The cause could be related to post-transplant cardiomyopathy or other factors such as tachycardiomyopathy or hypophosphatemic cardiomyopathy. There may also be a potential septic component given the presence of low-grade fever and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in the blood culture.

2. Hypophosphatemia: The patient has significant hypophosphatemia, which is likely related to refeeding syndrome and liver injury with regeneration. Aggressive repletion of phosphate is necessary to minimize hypophosphatemia-associated cardiomyopathy.

3. Atrial tachycardia: The exact etiology of the atrial tachycardia is unclear. The patient's best response has been to blood transfusion. Monitoring and daily ECGs will be important for ongoing assessment.

4. Liver failure: The patient has liver failure secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged man admitted to the ICU with a history of heart failure and end-stage liver disease. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and catheters in place. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 158 bpm and low blood pressure ranging from 53/51 mmHg to 74/56 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient is experiencing monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), for which lidocaine has been started.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is already experiencing VT, and there is a risk of further cardiac arrhythmias due to his underlying heart condition and the presence of other factors such as electrolyte imbalances.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, heart failure, or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's serum creatinine levels have been increasing, suggesting possible kidney dysfunction, which could be due to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Liver failure: The patient has end-stage liver disease, and his liver function tests show elevated ALT and AST levels, indicating possible liver dysfunction.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated D-dimer level and a decreased fibrinogen level, indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2146-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis. TTE
   from [**12-7**] confirmed LVEF  <20%. Etiology could be 'post-transplant cmp,'
   tachycardiomyopathy or hypophosphatemic cardiomyopathy. Potential
   septic component given low grade fever and VRE in Bcx, but WBC normal.
   Impella device, now day 8, turned down to p2 on [**2145-12-6**].  Pressor
   requirement in flux but continues on phenylephrine and vasopressin.
   Patient not candidate for cardiac transplant per [**Hospital1 **] cardiac surgery
   team.  As patient has not demonstrated expected recovery following
   transplant, plan & expectations for care requires refinement and
   multiple care teams will meet today to discuss.
   - Inter-team meeting today at 12:30PM (transplant, liver, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to
   discuss further management
   - S/p impella placement (Day 8 = [**2145-12-7**]), turned down to p2 on [**2145-12-6**].
   Will discuss removal vs. replacement in inter-team meeting today.
   - Continue dapto (VRE), micafungin ([**Female First Name (un) 444**]) and [**Last Name (un) **] (broad gram neg
   coverage)
   - monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to maintain CVP in low
   20s, MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin as needed. If
   hemodynamics acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to
   minimize liver injury
   - aggressively replete phos while minimizing sodium load (giving IV
   repletion today to augment PO repletion). Can give 15-30 meq q8.
   - f/u cultures
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   .
   # Hypophosphatemia: clinically important (as above). Related to
   refeeding syndrome and liver injury with regeneration. Need to replete
   aggressively to minimize hypophosphatemia-associated cardiomyopathy.
   - Replete (as above)
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia
 Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating
   tachycardia: would avoid rate control unless persistently above 180.
   Cardioversion is not an option with multiple pressors and impella in
   place. His best responses have been to blood transfusion.
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. Worse yesterday ([**12-5**]) compared to [**2145-12-4**], after period of
   improvement.  Improving again today.  Overall stable. Hepatic
   vasculature patent per U/S. Cellcept d/c'd on [**2144-12-5**].
   - consider weaning phenylephrine slowly to improve transplant perfusion
   - transplant surgery recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, continue tacrolimus, redose daily
   based on level.  check tacrolimus level daily at 6 am per Tx team, goal
   tacro level [**5-10**].
   - monitor LFTs daily
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - most likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome.
   CVVH filter clotted and replaced on [**2145-12-5**]
   - renal recs appreciated.
   - cont CVVH
   - lytes repletion per renal scale; per renal aggressively replete phos
   - straight cath every other day.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia: hct 32.8. hemolysis labs positive. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella. Had 1 unit yesterday [**12-5**]
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: patient not known diabetic, but had elevated blood
   sugars on steroids.  Pt on NPH 4 units [**Hospital1 **] and sliding scale. Was
   hypoglycemic to 25 on [**2144-12-5**]; resuscitated with D50 amps; likely
   related to stopped tubefeeds but could also reflect liver failure.
   Sliding scale more spaced out.
   - continue current regimen.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Dropped from 52 to 45 from [**12-5**] to [**12-6**]. platelets as
   low as 16 in past, Last Plt transfusion [**12-4**].  HIT ab neg in past.
   - cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - treating as HIT, continue bival
   - f/u HIT level
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery. Was on
   heparin but then may have had clot on left femoral while therapeutic on
   heparin, related to possible HIT or impella.
   - continue bivalrudin. No dosing changes while on CVVH (assume CrCl of
   30), also thrombin is responsible for 80% of metabolism
   - monitor PTT (goal 50-60+) q12, tolerating 60-65
   .
   # Encephalopathy: worsening, not following commands.  Portuguese is 1st
   language.  Seems to be slightly more alert went cardiac index is higher
   suggesting that some componenet of encephalopathy might be
   hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor exam.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent a liver transplant on [**2146-11-15**]. He is currently in the ICU due to post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. The patient has been experiencing various complications, including shock, hypophosphatemia, atrial tachycardia, hepatic failure, anuric renal failure, acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to post-transplant cardiomyopathy with LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypophosphatemia: The patient has low phosphate levels, which can contribute to muscle weakness, respiratory failure, and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has an atrial tachycardia, which may be related to electrolyte imbalances or hepatic dysfunction. If left untreated, it can lead to increased cardiac workload, arrhythmias, and potentially heart failure.
4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating potential liver failure. This can result in impaired metabolism of drugs, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2146-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis. TTE
   from [**12-7**] confirmed LVEF  <20%. Etiology could be 'post-transplant cmp,'
   tachycardiomyopathy or hypophosphatemic cardiomyopathy. Potential
   septic component given low grade fever and VRE in Bcx, but WBC normal.
   Impella device, now day 8, turned down to p2 on [**2145-12-6**].  Pressor
   requirement in flux but continues on milrinone, phenylephrine and
   vasopressin. CVP
s ranging [**9-19**] over past 24 hours. Patient not
   candidate for cardiac transplant per [**Hospital1 **] cardiac surgery team.  As
   patient has not demonstrated expected recovery following transplant,
   plan & expectations for care requires refinement and multiple care
   teams will meet today to discuss.
   - Inter-team meeting today at 12:30PM (transplant, liver, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to
   discuss further management
   - S/p impella placement (Day 8 = [**2145-12-7**]), turned down to p2 on [**2145-12-6**].
   Will discuss removal vs. replacement in inter-team meeting today.
   - Continue dapto (VRE), micafungin ([**Female First Name (un) 444**]) and [**Last Name (un) **] (broad gram neg
   coverage)
   - Monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to raise CVP to low 20s,
   MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin. If hemodynamics
   acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to minimize
   liver injury.
   - Replete phos to goal of 3.0
   - f/u blood cultures, all demonstrate NTGD since positive Enteroccocal
   culture from [**12-2**]
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia with intermittent VT
 Patient with more frequent
   runs of VT, requiring Lidocaine gtt overnight.
   Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia: would avoid
   rate control unless persistently above 180. Cardioversion is not an
   option with multiple pressors and impella in place. His best responses
   have been to blood transfusion.
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - Likely [**1-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. CVVH filter
   clotted and replaced on [**2145-12-5**], clotted again on [**2145-12-6**] so CVVH on
   hold. Renal requesting that IR replace line & IR is aware. Cr slightly
   elevated this AM to 1.5 in context of held CVVH.
   - Discuss replacing line with IR this AM
   - Continue CVVH if line replaced
   - F/U renal recs
   - lytes repletion per renal scale
   - straight cath every other day
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. LFT
s with slight variations, but overall stable. Hepatic
   vasculature patent per U/S. Cellcept d/c'd on [**2144-12-5**].
   - consider weaning phenylephrine to improve transplant perfusion as
   patient tolerates
   - transplant surgery recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, continue tacrolimus, redose daily
   based on level.  check tacrolimus level daily at 6 am per Tx team, goal
   tacro level [**5-10**].
   - monitor LFTs daily
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Hypophosphatemia -  Resolved with aggressive repletion on [**2145-12-6**].
   Likely [**1-4**] refeeding syndrome and liver injury with regeneration. Need
   to maintain appropriate level to minimize hypophosphatemia-associated
   cardiomyopathy.
   - Replete PRN to goal of 3
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia: HCT 33.6. Hemolysis labs positive. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient not known diabetic, but had elevated blood
   sugars on steroids.  NPH held in context of episode of hypoglycemia on
   [**2145-12-5**] (no TF
s vs. liver failure), now just on sliding scale.
   - continue sliding scale.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 51 on [**2145-12-7**]. Platelets nadir was 16,
   last PLT transfusion [**2145-12-4**].  HIT-Ab neg from [**2145-12-4**].
   - Cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - Treating as HIT, continue bival
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery. Was on
   heparin but then may have had clot on left femoral while therapeutic on
   heparin, related to possible HIT or impella. [**Month (only) 11**] also require higher
   doses of anticoagulation due to vasoconstriction from pressors leading
   to lower bioavailability.
   - continue bivalrudin gtt at current dose for now. Not currently on
   CVVH as line fem line is not working, but IR may replace later today
   after discussion with team
   - monitor PTT (goal 50-60+) q12, tolerating 60-65
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 No communication, purposeful movement.  More alert
   with higher cardiac index suggesting that some component of
   encephalopathy may be hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor closely

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) dilation/hypokinesis. A TTE confirmed an LVEF <20%. The etiology could be post-transplant cardiomyopathy, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or hypophosphatemic cardiomyopathy. There is also a potential septic component given the low-grade fever and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in the blood culture, despite normal white blood cell (WBC) count. The Impella device, now on day 8, has been turned down to p2 on [**2145-12-6**]. Pressor requirements are fluctuating, and the patient continues on milrinone, phenylephrine, and vasopressin.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] passed at 1035 due to cardiopulmonary collapse despite 3
   pressors and an impella. The choice to intubate was deffered given
   grave prognosis and very poor cardiac status. Transplant hepatology and
   surgery were [**Name (NI) 1850**], as were his heart failure cardiologist and his
   wife. Consensus was achieved regarding management.
   Below is the plan developed prior to these events.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 8206**] is a 57 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring HD and hepatopulmonary syndrome and HTN s/p liver
   transplant on [**2146-11-15**], with anuric renal failure post-op on CVVH who
   has had a very prolonged hospital course.  He is in CCU for management
   of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with EF of 10%
   .
   # Shock
 Likely cardiogenic, given LV and RV dilation/hypokinesis. TTE
   from [**12-7**] confirmed LVEF  <20%. Etiology could be 'post-transplant cmp,'
   tachycardiomyopathy or hypophosphatemic cardiomyopathy. Potential
   septic component given low grade fever and VRE in Bcx, but WBC normal.
   Impella device, now day 8, turned down to p2 on [**2145-12-6**].  Pressor
   requirement in flux but continues on milrinone, phenylephrine and
   vasopressin. CVP
s ranging [**9-19**] over past 24 hours. Patient not
   candidate for cardiac transplant per [**Hospital1 **] cardiac surgery team.  As
   patient has not demonstrated expected recovery following transplant,
   plan & expectations for care requires refinement and multiple care
   teams will meet today to discuss.
   - Inter-team meeting today at 12:30PM (transplant, liver, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to
   discuss further management
   - S/p impella placement (Day 8 = [**2145-12-7**]), turned down to p2 on [**2145-12-6**].
   Will discuss removal vs. replacement in inter-team meeting today.
   - Continue dapto (VRE), micafungin ([**Female First Name (un) 444**]) and [**Last Name (un) **] (broad gram neg
   coverage)
   - Monitor hemodynamic: goal CI> 1.8, attempt to raise CVP to low 20s,
   MAP > 60
   - cont milirinone gtt with phenylephrine, vasopressin. If hemodynamics
   acceptable, can consider weaning phenylephrine further to minimize
   liver injury.
   - Replete phos to goal of 3.0
   - f/u blood cultures, all demonstrate NTGD since positive Enteroccocal
   culture from [**12-2**]
   - c/w thiamine replacement
   .
   # Atrial tachycardia with intermittent VT
 Patient with more frequent
   runs of VT, requiring Lidocaine gtt overnight.
   Exact etiology unclear. Seems to be tolerating tachycardia: would avoid
   rate control unless persistently above 180. Cardioversion is not an
   option with multiple pressors and impella in place. His best responses
   have been to blood transfusion.
   - monitor on tele
   - Daily ECGs
   .
   # Anuric renal failure - Likely [**1-4**] hepatorenal syndrome. CVVH filter
   clotted and replaced on [**2145-12-5**], clotted again on [**2145-12-6**] so CVVH on
   hold. Renal requesting that IR replace line & IR is aware. Cr slightly
   elevated this AM to 1.5 in context of held CVVH.
   - Discuss replacing line with IR this AM
   - Continue CVVH if line replaced
   - F/U renal recs
   - lytes repletion per renal scale
   - straight cath every other day
   .
   # Liver failure [**1-4**] alcholic cirrohsis - s/p liver transplant on
   [**11-15**].  LFTs abnormalities developed in the setting of high pressor
   requirements. LFT
s with slight variations, but overall stable. Hepatic
   vasculature patent per U/S. Cellcept d/c'd on [**2144-12-5**].
   - consider weaning phenylephrine to improve transplant perfusion as
   patient tolerates
   - transplant surgery recs appreciated
   - continue prednisone 15mg PO daily, continue tacrolimus, redose daily
   based on level.  check tacrolimus level daily at 6 am per Tx team, goal
   tacro level [**5-10**].
   - monitor LFTs daily
   - cont prophylaxis with valganclovir (dose confirmed with pharmacy) and
   bactrim
   .
   # Hypophosphatemia -  Resolved with aggressive repletion on [**2145-12-6**].
   Likely [**1-4**] refeeding syndrome and liver injury with regeneration. Need
   to maintain appropriate level to minimize hypophosphatemia-associated
   cardiomyopathy.
   - Replete PRN to goal of 3
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Anemia: HCT 33.6. Hemolysis labs positive. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   shear stress on RBCs [**1-4**] impella.
   - IV protonix 40mg Q12
   - continue EPO 4000 units
   - monitor Hct daily
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient not known diabetic, but had elevated blood
   sugars on steroids.  NPH held in context of episode of hypoglycemia on
   [**2145-12-5**] (no TF
s vs. liver failure), now just on sliding scale.
   - continue sliding scale.  monitor FS.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT count 51 on [**2145-12-7**]. Platelets nadir was 16,
   last PLT transfusion [**2145-12-4**].  HIT-Ab neg from [**2145-12-4**].
   - Cont to monitor. No transfusion for now
   - Treating as HIT, continue bival
   .
   # Hepatic vein thrombosis: s/p thrombectomy prior to surgery. Was on
   heparin but then may have had clot on left femoral while therapeutic on
   heparin, related to possible HIT or impella. [**Month (only) 11**] also require higher
   doses of anticoagulation due to vasoconstriction from pressors leading
   to lower bioavailability.
   - continue bivalrudin gtt at current dose for now. Not currently on
   CVVH as line fem line is not working, but IR may replace later today
   after discussion with team
   - monitor PTT (goal 50-60+) q12, tolerating 60-65
   .
   # Encephalopathy
 No communication, purposeful movement.  More alert
   with higher cardiac index suggesting that some component of
   encephalopathy may be hypoperfusion
   - continue to monitor closely

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who underwent liver transplant on [**2146-11-15**]. He is currently in the ICU for management of post-transplant cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including cardiogenic shock, atrial tachycardia with intermittent ventricular tachycardia (VT), anuric renal failure, liver failure, hypophosphatemia, acute on chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic vein thrombosis. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and multiple care teams will meet to discuss further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low EF (<20%) indicates severe cardiac dysfunction, which could lead to cardiogenic shock. The use of impella, pressors, and vasopressin suggests ongoing efforts to maintain adequate perfusion.
2. Atrial Tachycardia with Intermittent VT: The patient's frequent runs of VT require close monitoring, and the exact etiology is unclear. This condition may contribute to hemodynamic instability and could potentially progress to sustained VT or other arrhythmias.
3. Anuric Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome. CVVH filtration has been attempted, but"
