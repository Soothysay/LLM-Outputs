","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple recent hospitalizations for infections. She presents with fever, transient hypotension, acute anemia, and a heart murmur. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 27 on admission to 20.5 yesterday night, and she received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) without an appropriate response. Her Hct today decreased to 23.6. The differential diagnosis includes bleeding, hemolysis, or decreased production of red blood cells. 

The patient meets the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with fever and tachycardia, but there is no clear source of infection. She is currently stable on empiric antibiotic therapy with cefepime and vancomycin for febrile neutropenia. 

The patient has a heart murmur, but transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed no vegetations. Cultures negative to date, but endocarditis is still on the differential given the patient's fevers. 

The patient also has hyponatremia, which is likely hypovolemic in nature. There is a concern for adrenal insufficiency, especially with mild hyperkalemia, which has now resolved with intravenous fluid repletion. 

The patient has a history of CLL and has undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy. She continues to"

   TTE:  CONCLUSIONS: Normal biventricular cavity size with preserved
   biventricular systolic function. No valvular vegetations or masses
   identified. If clinical suspicion of endocarditis is high, a TEE could
   help to clarify.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-4-15**], the
   degree of mitral regurgitation has decreased. The other findings are
   similar.

   This is a 66 year old female with history of CLL with multiple recent
   hospitalizations for infections here with a fever and transient
   hypotension.
   .
   # Transient hypotension:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever and
   tachycardia, without clear source for infection and stable blood
   pressures with normal lactate.  Currently without clear localizing
   symptoms.  No known indwelling line or hardware.  Also with Given
   fevers at home, hypovolemia related to increased insensible loss is
   also possible.  Recent steroid use and discontinuation may also be
   contributing; given dexamethasone in ED.  Currently hemodynamically
   stable.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple recent hospitalizations for infections. She presents with fever, transient hypotension, and no clear source of infection. The patient also has a heart murmur, which is a new finding, and her previous echocardiogram showed mild tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. She has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, pending culture results. 

The patient's lab results show hyponatremia, anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated blood glucose levels. Her vital signs are stable with a heart rate in the 100s, blood pressure around 93/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: Given the patient's history of CLL and recent hospitalizations, she is at increased risk for infections. The ongoing administration of antibiotics is appropriate to cover potential bacterial infections.
2. Endocarditis: The new heart murmur and previous findings of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram raise concern for endocarditis. Further evaluation with repeat echocardiogram and culture data is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's mild hyperkalemia and hypon"

   This is a 66 year old female with history of CLL with multiple recent
   hospitalizations for infections here with fever of unclear etiology.
   #Neutropenic fever:  Pt spiked to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday and her WBC went down
   to 1.9.  No source of infection identified as pt doesn
t have
   localizing symptoms.  Pt was also tachycardic while febrile (up to
   140s).  She was pan cultured, previous (-) to date.  Currently
   afebrile, on cefepime 2g IV q8h for empiric coverage.  As per BMT,
   [**Doctor Last Name 9818**] transformation is possible or persistent CCL could be
   attributed to her persistent fevers.
   -cont cefepime
   -added a diff to eval for neutropenia

   #Acute anemia:  Pt
s hct dropped from 27 on admission to 20.5 yesterday
   night.  She was transfused 2 units PRBC
s and did not have an
   appropriate response, hct 24.5.  Hct today decreased to 22.5.  Ddx
   includes bleeding (no obvious source found) vs hemolysis
   (auto-antibodies from CLL) vs decresed production (medication side
   effect, parvo virus infection, marrow suppression/invasion by her CLL)
   vs sequestration.  Hemolysis labs ordered (Haptoglobin <20, Tbili 0.9,
   LDH 219, [**Doctor Last Name 2648**] negative, Coombs test negative).  Parvo PCR pending,
   folate level normal, retic count 0.4.

   -f/u parvo pcr
   -transfuse to hct >21
   # Tachycardia: With sinus tach to 130s on admission, transiently
   tachycardic overnight while febrile.  Most likely cause of tachycardia
   is pt being febrile.  [**Month (only) 60**] be some component of hypovolemia given mild
   response to IVF.
    - Cont monitor with hydration (w/ LR) given non-gap acidosis.
   # Transient hypotension:  Pt was transiently hypotensive in the ED but
   that has now resolved w/ hydration.
   -cont monitoring BP
   -f/u culture data

   # Heart Murmur:  TTE showed no vegetations (results above).  Cultures
   negative to date, but in pt with fevers, endocarditis obviously on
   differential.
   - Follow culture data, if positive will obtain TEE.

   # CLL: p53 mutation, s/p multiple rounds of chemo (last Campath [**10-9**],
   previously fludarabine-based therapy CVP, CHOP) with continued bulky

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple recent hospitalizations for infections. She presented with fever of unclear origin, tachycardia, and hypotension. Her white blood cell count has been consistently low, indicating neutropenia. The patient was pan cultured and started on cefepime for empiric coverage. She also received a blood transfusion but did not show an appropriate response. Her hemoglobin levels have decreased, and hemolysis labs have been ordered to determine the cause. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to her fever, but there may be some component of hypovolemia. Her transient hypotension has resolved with hydration. Cultures have been negative to date, but endocarditis remains on the differential. The patient's CLL is being closely monitored, and she is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of infections and is currently febrile with unknown origin. She is at risk for developing further infections due to her neutropenia and possible compromised immune system.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped significantly, indicating acute anemia. This could be due to bleeding, hemolysis, decreased production, sequestration, or other causes. Further investigation is needed to determine the"
