   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo female with MMP including CAD, Atrial fibrillation transferred
   for workup of new onset ascites of uncertain etiology, altered mental
   status and acute renal failure now transferred to MICU for respiratory
   distress and atrial fibrillation with [**Month/Year (2) 1725**].
   .
   # Acute renal failure - ATN evident. Although urine Na <20 suggestive
   of possible prerenal component. Pt was given albumin and 3L IVF
   challenge today w/ no response in urine output. Diuresis may worsening
   renal failure however given respiratory failure will diurese
   aggressively.
   - No response to 40mg IV lasix on floor, will uptitrate to response,
   consider addition of thiazide
   - Urine electrolytes, sediment, and eosinophils.
   - Foley to monitor urine output
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - Pt with [**Month/Year (2) 1725**] in setting of volume overload.
   Diurese as above. Rate responsive to lopressor 5mg IV on floor. Hold
   warfarin for now, in case possible procedures (INR 7)
   - Pt with continued intermittent [**Last Name (LF) 1725**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] start dilt gtt to control
   rate, improve CO while attempting diuresis
   .
   # Altered Mental Status - Most likely toxic/metabolic with liver and
   renal failure. On admission the patient was receiving several centrally
   acing medications including metoclopramide, lorazepam, trazodone, as
   well as standing and PRN oxycodone/APAP at OSH, but MS was reported to
   be clearer than present. Concern for infection (SBP?) vs enceph.
   - CT Head negative for bleed (in setting of supratherapuetic INR)
   - Continue to Hold centrally acting medications.
   - Empiric lactulose to see if this improves mental status - per reports
   pt w/ mild improvement w/ lactulose but self DC'd NGT this pm, will
   change lactulose to PR
   - Empiric coverage for SBP as above
   - F/u blood/urine cultures
   - CXR w/o infection
   - CIS
   .
   # Ascites - Appears [**12-29**] cirrhosis, but Concern for GI malignancy given
   gastic thickening on CT at OSH, although was non-contrast study. U/S
   consistent with cirrhosis on prelim read. Concern for SBP however
   unable to perform paracentesis previously so started on empiric
   ceftriaxone.
   - Consider contrast CT with prophylactic regimen given unclear history
   of radiocontrast allergy.
   - Consider repeat diagnostic/therapuetic paracentesis
   - Continue ceftriaxone for SBP
   .
   # Coronary artery disease - Had chest pain at OSH, but was ruled-out
   for MI.
   - Continue aspirin, statin, BB
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia - Unclear etiology. No evidence of SBP on
   OSH paracentesis. ? UTI based on foul smelling urine at OSH.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin x 3 days.
   - CXR negative for infiltrate
   - On ceftriaxone for SBP emprically
   .
   # Left Adrenal nodule - Noted on OSH CT scan. Needs follow-up as
   outpatient.
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO with AMS
   .
   # PPX: PPI, holding heparin SQ since on warfarin, lactulose , INR 6.9
   will give additional 5mg SC Vit K pending possible need for line
   placement, paracentesis, etc
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV
   .
   # CODE: At OSH pt was made DNR DNI: Attorney and Healthcare proxy
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3581**]. Resident spoke directly with Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 3581**] today, who
   expressed surprise that patient was DNR DNI at OSH. Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 3581**] noted,
   however, that she was lucid enough at the OSH to have been able to
   communicate her true intentions and wishes. Given that OSH
   documentation indicates patient has been DNR DNI (recorded in the
   records presented on transfer and written on the pt's OSH wrist band),
   conclusion of conversation was that patient would remain DNR DNI on
   evening of admission, and that the HCP would need come-in to the
   hospital to re-assess. After discussion following resp distress this pm
   code status was reversed to Full Code
   .
   # DISPO: Pending above evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for workup of new-onset ascites, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of allergies to iodine, swelling of the face, and an allergy to ceftriaxone. She has been receiving several centrally acting medications.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute renal failure - The patient has acute renal failure with oliguria. She was given albumin and IV fluids challenge today with no response in urine output. Aggressive diuresis will be continued to improve renal function and address respiratory failure. The possibility of worsening renal failure is a concern.
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Rate control will be achieved with metoprolol. Diuretics will be used to manage volume overload. Warfarin therapy will be held temporarily due to an elevated INR.
3. Altered mental status - The patient has altered mental status likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy caused by liver and renal failure. Central acting medications will be held, and lactulose will be given empirically to improve mental status.
4. Ascites - The patient has ascites"

   status and acute renal failure now transferred to MICU for respiratory
   distress and atrial fibrillation with [**Month/Year (2) 1725**].
   .
   # Acute renal failure - ATN evident. Although urine Na <20 suggestive
   of possible prerenal component. Pt was given albumin and 3L IVF
   challenge today w/ no response in urine output. Diuresis may worsening
   renal failure however given respiratory failure will diurese
   aggressively.
   - No response to 40mg IV lasix on floor, will uptitrate to response,
   consider addition of thiazide
   - Urine electrolytes, sediment, and eosinophils.
   - Foley to monitor urine output
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - Pt with [**Month/Year (2) 1725**] in setting of volume overload.
   Diurese as above. Rate responsive to lopressor 5mg IV on floor. Hold
   warfarin for now, in case possible procedures (INR 7)
   - Pt with continued intermittent [**Last Name (LF) 1725**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] start dilt gtt to control
   rate, improve CO while attempting diuresis

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and possible cirrhosis. She was admitted with new onset ascites of uncertain etiology, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, which is evident from the decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels. The cause of renal failure is likely prerenal due to volume depletion, but there may also be an intrinsic component as indicated by the presence of casts in the urine. Aggressive diuresis may worsen renal function, so careful monitoring is required.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is now exacerbated by volume overload. Diuretics will be used to manage the atrial fibrillation and control the heart rate. It is important to monitor the patient's response to diuretics and consider adding a beta-blocker if needed.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors, including liver and renal failure, as well as possible infection. Metabolic encephalopathy should be considered and managed accordingly. The patient should be monitored closely for any signs of improvement or deterioration in mental status.

4. Ascites: The patient's ascites appears"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the hospital with new-onset ascites. She was admitted to the ICU due to afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR), acute renal failure (ARF), respiratory insufficiency, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient underwent paracentesis, received ceftriaxone for SBP, and was given midodrine and octreotide empirically. Her respiratory insufficiency improved, but she still has wheezing and rhonchi with a possible left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to toxic-metabolic causes, and she will be started on lactulose and rifaximin. Further plans are as per the resident note.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Hydrothorax: Due to the patient's cirrhosis and ascites, there is a risk of hepatic hydrothorax, which is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. This can lead to respiratory distress and compromise lung function.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's altered renal function could progress to HRS, which is a form of renal failure associated with severe liver disease. It is characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function despite"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred to the MICU for evaluation of new-onset ascites, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient has developed respiratory distress requiring BiPAP support and appears to be continually aspirating. She also has evidence of chronic liver disease with cirrhosis of unclear etiology, as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a concern for hepatorenal syndrome. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure with muddy casts on urine sediment, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's altered mental status is likely due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of liver and renal failure, as well as infection. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and coronary artery disease. An incidental left adrenal nodule was noted on the CT scan and requires follow-up as an outpatient.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could lead to further hypoxia and potential respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia, which can be a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The combination of liver disease and"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation who was admitted for evaluation of new-onset ascites of uncertain etiology, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. 

The patient has developed respiratory distress and requires BiPAP support due to a massive aspiration event. She appears uncomfortable on BiPAP and desaturates immediately with removal of the mask. There is also evidence of encephalopathy, and she is stooling well. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and is currently receiving ceftriaxone. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 74-115 bpm, blood pressure between 109/51-135/64 mmHg, respiratory rate 20-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient has a history of cirrhosis and evidence of chronic liver disease. An ultrasound is consistent with cirrhosis, and she has received albumin treatment. 

The patient's acute renal failure is pre-renal in nature, and there is concern for hepatorenal syndrome. 

The patient has altered mental status, most likely due to toxic/metabolic causes in the setting of liver and renal failure as well as infection"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted for evaluation of new-onset ascites, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient developed respiratory distress overnight with increased infiltrates on chest x-ray and required BiPAP support. A 2L paracentesis was performed due to respiratory distress after an aspiration event, with WBC 190 in ascitic fluid. FeNa is 0.5% per urine electrolytes. The patient received albumin 150 gm, octreotide, and midodrine out of concern for hepatorenal syndrome, but midodrine was held as the patient is strictly NPO. She was also started on increased ceftriaxone for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). D5W 1L was given for hypernatremia. The patient has a history of aspiration events and is currently uncomfortable on BiPAP, desaturating immediately with the removal of the mask. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress and increased infiltrates on chest x-ray indicate possible acute respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and support with BiPAP or mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. SBP: The patient's elevated WBC count in ascitic fluid and the presence of fever suggest a possible infection in the abdominal cavity."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of new-onset ascites of uncertain etiology, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient has experienced several complications during her stay, including respiratory distress requiring BiPAP support, massive aspiration event, suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cirrhosis, hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and leukocytosis with bandemia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has shown signs of respiratory distress, which may be due to aspiration events. Continuous aspiration can lead to pneumonia and further respiratory complications.
2. SBP: The patient has been diagnosed with SBP, and there is a concern for subsequent aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat or prevent infection.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has evidence of cirrhosis with unclear etiology. This could lead to complications such as variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and portal hypertension.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: Given the patient's pre-renal picture and liver failure, there is a concern for hepatorenal syndrome. This condition can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's massive aspiration event may lead to aspiration pneumonia due to the inhalation of gastric contents into the lungs.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's pre-renal azotemia and concern for hepatorenal syndrome require further evaluation and management.
3. Infection: The patient is already on ceftriaxone for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but additional antibiotics may be needed due to potential aspiration pneumonia.
4. Hepatitis: The patient's negative Hepatitis B and C serology indicate no active infection, but further evaluation for other causes of cirrhosis is necessary.

   76 year-old female with history of coronary artery disease, atrial
   fibrillation transferred from OSH for evaluation of new onset ascites
   of unclear etiology, altered mental status and acute renal failure,
   transferred to MICU for respiratory distress and rapid atrial
   fibrillation.  The patient had a massive aspiration event yesterday and
   now has respiratory distress requiring BiPAP.  She now appears
   uncomfortable on BiPAP and desaturates immediately with removal of
   mask.  Given her code status and overall poor prognosis, will need to
   discuss goals of care with the patient
s health care proxy today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient had a massive aspiration event yesterday and now has respiratory distress requiring BiPAP. She appears uncomfortable on BiPAP and desaturates immediately with the removal of the mask. The patient has new-onset ascites, acute renal failure, and evidence of chronic liver disease. She is being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cirrhosis, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's acid-base status is mixed respiratory and anion-gap metabolic acidosis. She also has altered mental status, most likely due to toxic/metabolic causes in the setting of liver and renal failure as well as infection. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could worsen, leading to further hypoxemia and potential respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient may develop additional infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to her compromised immune system and prolonged intubation.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's pre-renal acute renal failure may progress to hepatorenal syndrome, which could result in severe kidney dysfunction.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's chronic liver disease"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, who was admitted for evaluation of new-onset ascites, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. She developed respiratory distress overnight and required BiPAP support. A 2L paracentesis was performed due to respiratory distress following an aspiration event, with WBC 190 in the ascitic fluid. FeNa is 0.5% per urine electrolytes. The patient received albumin 150 gm, octreotide, and midodrine out of concern for hepatorenal syndrome. Ceftriaxone dosage was increased to 2 gm daily for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). D5W was given for hypernatremia. The patient's allergies include iodine and swelling of the face. The last dose of antibiotics was ceftriaxone on 12-26 at 09:44 PM. The patient has been on BiPAP support, oxygen as needed, and has undergone a 2L paracentesis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress due to aspiration pneumonia: The patient experienced a massive aspiration event, leading to respiratory distress. This could potentially lead to pneumonia and further respiratory complications.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's low urine sodium (FeNa 0.5%) and evidence of liver disease raise concern for hepatorenal syndrome, which is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with cirrhosis of unclear etiology, acute renal failure (ARF), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and now respiratory insufficiency following an aspiration event. She is in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is dependent on bipap ventilation. The patient has worsening right-sided infiltrate, significant a-a gradient, and coarse rhonchi throughout. Vancomycin has been added to her antibiotic regimen to cover for respiratory infection. White blood cell count on paracentesis is appropriately trending down, and creatinine has improved somewhat with albumin and repeat urine studies consistent with pre-renal/hepatic renal syndrome. A bladder pressure check will be conducted today. The patient continues to receive lactulose/rifaximin for altered mental status. Her prognosis is concerning, particularly regarding the extent of treatable liver disease. The patient is DNR/DNI, and a discussion on goals of care will be held with the healthcare provider today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory insufficiency and worsening right-sided infiltrate indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of her respiratory status are crucial.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a common complication in patients with advanced liver disease. Continued administration of lactulose and rifaximin is appropriate, but close monitoring for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with cirrhosis of unclear etiology, acute renal failure (ARF), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and now respiratory insufficiency due to aspiration. She is on mechanical ventilation with Bipap and has worsening right-sided infiltrate with significant a-a gradient and coarse rhonchi throughout. Vancomycin has been added to her antibiotic regimen to cover for respiratory infection. Her white blood cell count on paracentesis is trending down appropriately, and her creatinine level has improved somewhat with albumin and repeat urine studies indicating pre-renal/hepatic renal syndrome. Lactulose and rifaximin are being continued for altered mental status. The patient is DNR/DNI, and we will attempt to meet with the healthcare proxy today to discuss goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory insufficiency and aspiration event put her at risk for further respiratory failure, which could be life-threatening if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The patient has a worsening right-sided infiltrate and coarse rhonchi throughout, indicating a possible respiratory infection. The addition of vancomycin to her antibiotic regimen is an attempt to cover for this infection, but she remains at risk for developing or worsening infections due to her compromised immune system.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is"

   76 year-old female with history of coronary artery disease, atrial
   fibrillation transferred from OSH for evaluation of new onset ascites
   of unclear etiology, altered mental status and acute renal failure,
   transferred to MICU for respiratory distress and rapid atrial
   fibrillation.  The patient had a massive aspiration event yesterday and
   now has respiratory distress requiring BiPAP.  She now appears
   uncomfortable on BiPAP and desaturates immediately with removal of
   mask.  Given her code status and overall poor prognosis, will need to
   discuss goals of care with the patient
s health care proxy today.
   # Aspiration event/respiratory distress: Massive aspiration event
   yesterday.  Patient DNI and treating supportively.  A-a gradient <
   200.  Need to discuss goals of care with the patient
s health care
   proxy today.
   - Continue BiPAP
   - On ceftriaxone, will add vancomycin for potential aspiration
   pneumonia
   - Status post 2L paracentesis yesterday
   # Cirrhosis/SBP: Ultrasound consistent with cirrhosis and evidence of
   chronic liver disease. Cirrhosis of unclear etiology
 negative
   Hepatitis B and C serology, iron saturation low.  Patient has been on
   ceftriaxone since admission [**12-24**] and was diagnosed with SBP on
   paracentesis [**12-26**].  Received 1.5 gm/kg albumin day 1 and ordered for 1
   gm/kg today (day 3).  Evidence of encephalopathy
 stooling now on
   lactulose.  INR 5 on admission, improved with vitamin K
 platelets
   WNL, albumin improved with supplementation.
   - Evaluation for cirrhosis
 [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial Ab, anti-SM Ab,
   IgG, IgM
   - Continue ceftriaxone for SBP
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - Status post 2L paracentesis yesterday
   - Appreciate liver recommendations
   # Acute renal failure: Pre-renal per electrolytes.  Given pre-renal
   picture, concern for hepatorenal syndrome.
   - Repeat urine electrolytes
   - Albumin 1gm/kg today (third day)
   - Continue octreotide and midodrine
   # Acid-base: Mixed respiratory and anion-gap metabolic acidosis.
   Metabolic acidosis from renal failure, question lactic acidosis.
   - Treatment as above
   # Altered mental status: Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   liver and renal failure as well as infection. On admission the patient
   was receiving several centrally acing medications including
   metoclopramide, lorazepam, trazodone, as well as standing and
   narcotics. CT head negative for bleed.
   - Continue to hold sedating medications
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin
   - Treatment for infection as above
   # Atrial fibrillation: History of RVR.  Initially on diltiazem gtt.
   Will not anticoagulate given comorbidities.
   - Continue metoprolol for rate control
   # Coronary artery disease: No active signs or symptoms of ischemia.
   Ruled out for MI at OSH.
   - Continue aspirin, BB

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient had a massive aspiration event yesterday and is now on BiPAP. She appears uncomfortable on BiPAP and desaturates immediately with the removal of the mask. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI. She has multiple medical conditions including pneumonia, aspiration, cardiac dysrhythmia, renal failure, altered mental status, ascites, cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to further deterioration in her respiratory function and potentially result in respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has an infection indicated by the presence of pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). These infections can worsen her overall condition and may lead to sepsis.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can be exacerbated by her existing conditions such as liver failure and infection. This can further compromise her organ function and contribute to her poor prognosis.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including liver failure, infection, and medication effects. This can affect her ability to make decisions and communicate effectively.
5. Ascites:"

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 76-year-old woman with ascites and cirrhosis of unknown etiology. She has been admitted to the ICU for various medical complications, including pneumonia, cardiac dysrhythmia, renal failure, altered mental status, and aspiration. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension, tachycardia, low oxygen saturation, and abnormal blood gas levels. Physical examination reveals jaundice, distended abdomen, absent bowel sounds, and peripheral edema. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's condition has been deteriorating rapidly, with worsening respiratory distress and abdominal pain. She is unresponsive and not tolerating nasogastric tube medications. The healthcare provider's plan is to focus on comfort care, discontinuing invasive measures, blood draws, and unnecessary medications, including antibiotics. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory insufficiency due to pneumonia and aspiration, further deterioration of cardiac function, progression of acute renal failure, and increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression. Given the patient's altered mental status and refusal of aggressive interventions, close monitoring of her comfort and pain management is crucial."
