","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and COPD. She was admitted with a large left proximal PICA aneurysm that underwent coiling. Her hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium and resultant aspiration pneumonia with episodic mucous plugging and desaturation. The patient was extubated yesterday but still experiences intermittent mucous plugging. She also had recent aspiration pneumonia and completed 14 days of vancomycin and zosyn on [4-7]. She has undergone G tube placement and may have had poor cough, abdominal pain, and splinting. She was rapidly weaned off the vent but has been tenuous. The issue is her inability to cough effectively. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 142/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nebulization. She is currently receiving meropenem empirically. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience intermittent mucous plugging and desaturation despite being extubated. This puts her at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Dysphagia: The patient may have dysphagia likely related to neuro issues, especially after G tube placement. Swallow"

","The patient presented with respiratory distress and required invasive ventilation. They were successfully extubated but experienced difficulty clearing secretions, leading to intermittent fluctuations in oxygen saturation levels. The patient is hesitant about being re-intubated and has been started on meropenem empirically. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/46-155/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 381 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin, with diminished breath sounds on the right side and normal breath sounds on the left side. The cardiovascular examination is notable for normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, sodium of 137 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, glucose of 75 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 418. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm and underwent coiling. Her hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium, leading to aspiration pneumonia, episodic mucous plugging, and desaturation.

The patient was extubated yesterday but continues to have intermittent mucous plugging. She also had recent aspiration pneumonia and completed 14 days of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics from April 7th. A gastric (G) tube was placed on April 8th, and she may have had poor cough, abdominal pain, and splinting. The patient was rapidly weaned off the ventilator but remains tenuous.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing intermittent mucous plugging and desaturation. She has completed treatment for aspiration pneumonia and may have had poor cough and splinting. She was rapidly weaned off the ventilator but is currently tenuous. The plan includes continuing high-flow oxygen, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, and Mucomyst as needed. Dysphagia related to neuro issues is suspected, and swallowing evaluation is scheduled for Monday"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for a large left proximal popliteal artery (PICA) aneurysm and underwent coiling. Her hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium, resulting in aspiration pneumonia with episodic mucus plugging and desaturation. The patient was intubated but successfully extubated yesterday. However, she continues to experience intermittent mucus plugging, which causes episodes of desaturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still at risk of respiratory failure due to intermittent mucus plugging and aspiration pneumonia.
2. Dysphagia: The patient may have dysphagia, likely related to neuro issues. She will undergo a swallow evaluation on Monday.
3. Left-sided weakness: The patient has residual left-sided weakness following the PICA aneurysm coiling procedure. She will likely require rehabilitation.
4. Urinary retention: The patient has urinary retention and a urine culture showing over 100,000 yeast. She may require antifungal treatment (diflucan) and a Foley catheter.
5. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma: An MRI is needed to further characterize these findings.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and COPD. She was admitted for a large left proximal PICA aneurysm now post coiling. Her hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium with resultant aspiration pneumonia, episodic mucous plugging, and desaturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had several episodes of desaturation due to recurrent mucous plugging with poor strength and weak cough. This makes it difficult for her to clear her secretions.
2. Dysphagia s/p G tube placement: The patient is likely experiencing dysphagia related to the PICA aneurysm and brainstem compression. This can lead to difficulty in swallowing and feeding.
3. Urinary Retention: The patient has had urinary retention on transfer, with a urine culture showing >100 K yeast. This suggests a possible fungal infection in the urinary tract.
4. Left Kidney Cysts and Left Adrenal Incidentaloma: Further characterization of these findings is needed, potentially through an MRI.
5. PVD s/p SMA stenting: The patient had peripheral vascular disease and underwent SMA stenting. There are concerns about restarting Plavix and ASA after G-tube placement.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia should continue to be managed with a statin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm, which underwent coiling. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium with resultant aspiration pneumonia, episodes of mucous plugging, and desaturation.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to recurrent mucous plugging with poor strength and weak cough. She has had several episodes of desaturation since extubation, which improve with chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning. The patient completed a 14-day course of vancomycin and meropenem for aspiration pneumonia and has an gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placed on [**2189-4-8**]. She is experiencing abdominal pain contributing to her poor cough and has started on meropenem due to episodes of hypoxia, thick purulent secretions, and a slight increase in white blood cell count with low-grade fever.

The patient's other conditions include dysphagia post G-tube placement, left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm post coiling, urinary retention with yeast infection in the urinary tract, left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma, peripheral vascular disease post stenting of the superior mesenteric artery,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted due to a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. The hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium, leading to aspiration pneumonia with episodic mucus plugging and desaturation.

The patient was extubated yesterday but still has intermittent mucus plugging. She also had recent aspiration pneumonia with thick secretions and completed 14 days of vancomycin and zosyn on [**4-7**]. She has a feeding tube (G tube) placed on [**2189-4-8**] and may have had poor cough, abdominal pain, and splinting. The patient was weaned off the ventilator but has been tenuous overnight. The issue is the ability to cough effectively.

The patient is currently on high-flow oxygen, albuterol and ipratropium nebs standing, Mucomyst as needed, and meropenem until culture negative for 48 hours. She also has dysphagia likely related to neuro issues, with a plan to re-evaluate swallowing on Monday.

Additionally, the patient has dysphagia since the placement of a G tube, which is working well but held feeds last night due to tenuous status. This"

She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm and underwent coiling. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium, resulting in aspiration pneumonia, episodic mucous plugging, and desaturation. She has been intubated but remains at risk for respiratory failure due to intermittent mucous plugging and ineffective cough. The patient also has dysphagia likely related to neuro issues, for which swallow evaluation is planned on Monday. Other concerns include left-sided weakness from the aneurysm coiling, urinary retention, left kidney cysts, and an adrenal incidentaloma. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, statins, antihypertensives, antidepressants, and anxiolytics.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's intermittent mucous plugging and ineffective cough pose a risk for respiratory failure. Continuous high-flow oxygen and bronchodilators are being provided, but close monitoring and clearance of secretions remain crucial.
2. Dysphagia: The patient's dysphagia is likely related to neuro issues and may lead to aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition if not addressed properly. A swallow"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6713**] is a 66 y/o female with a PMH of PVD, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, COPD admitted with large left proximal PICA aneurysm
   now s/p coiling, hospital course complicated by aspiration of barium
   with resultant aspiration pneumonia with episodic mucous plugging and
   desaturation.
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure
 likely [**2-9**] recurrent mucous plugging with poor
   strength and weak cough making it hard for her to clear her
   secretions.  She has had several episodes of desaturation since
   extubation [**2-9**] mucus plugging which improves with chest pt and deep
   suctioning.  Of note she completed 14 days vanc/zosyn on [**4-7**] for her
   aspiration pneumonia.  She is s/p G tube [**2189-4-8**] and has abdominal pain
   since contributing to her poor cough. Meropenam started on [**4-10**] due to
   episodes of hypoxia and thick purulent secretions as well as slight
   increase in WBC with low grade fever.
   -Cont high flow 02
   -Albuterol, ipratropium nebs standing
   -Mucomyst prn
   - Cont meropenem until cx neg x48hrs, resend sputum cx as last one was
   cancelled for contamination
   -chest PT
   -incentive spirometer
   -acapella device
   -talk with respiratory about cough assist (MIE)
   -OOB
   .
   #Dysphagia s/p G tube placement:  G tube working well, but held TFs
   given tenuous status last night.  Likely related to PICA aneurysm and
   brainstem compression.  Also generally weak and deconditioned.
   -          continue  Tfs today
   -          -would benefit from repeat swallow study at rehab once
   strength improved
   .
   #. L PICA aneurysm s/p coiling - Serial head CT post procedure stable.
   - will likely need rehab given residual deficits
   - PT consult
   .
   # Urinary retention: she has had urinary retention on transfer
   - Urine Cx with >100 K yeast - consider diflucan, repeat UA and
   culture, consider changing foley if continues to have yeast
   - Foley replaced
   - Will likely go to rehab with foley and have Urology f/u
   -repeat UA and culture (although has been on long course of abx)
   .
   #. Left kidney cysts and left adrenal incidentaloma:
   - consider MRI for further characterization
   .
   #. PVD s/p SMA stenting [**8-15**]: bare metal stent
   -          plavix and ASA stopped on [**3-30**], ? for GTube
   -          -could likely restart (tb w/neuron/GI)
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin
   .
   #. Hypertension/tachycardia:
   - Cont PO dilt
   .
   #.Anxiety/Depression: pt has had depression during this admission.
   - continue citalopram 20mg daily
   - continue xanax 0.5mg prn
   .

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium leading to aspiration pneumonia, episodes of mucous plugging, and desaturation.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, dysphagia post-gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placement, left proximal popliteal artery (PICA) aneurysm status post-coiling, urinary retention with yeast infection in the urine, left kidney cysts, and left adrenal incidentaloma. She also has a history of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) with stenting.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Recurrent mucous plugging leading to respiratory failure due to poor strength and weak cough.
2. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) due to dysphagia and G-tube placement.
3. Infection of the urinary tract due to urinary retention and yeast infection.
4. Complications related to the left PICA aneurysm such as rebleeding or rupture.
5. Complications related to the left"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm, which underwent coiling. However, her hospital course was complicated by aspiration of barium and resultant aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing recurrent mucous plugging due to poor strength and weak cough. This makes it difficult for her to clear secretions, leading to episodes of desaturation. Chest physical therapy (PT) and deep suctioning have been helpful in improving her oxygen saturation levels. She completed 14 days of vancomycin (Vanc) and zinc (Zosyn) for aspiration pneumonia. Additionally, she has been started on meropenem due to episodes of hypoxia, thick purulent secretions, and a slight increase in white blood cell count with low-grade fever. The plan is to continue high-flow oxygen therapy, albuterol and ipratropium nebs, mucomyst as needed, chest PT, incentive spirometer, acapella device, and discuss cough assist (MIE) with the respiratory team.

2. Dysphagia s/p G-tube placement: The patient has a gastrostomy tube (G-tube"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and COPD. She was admitted for a large left proximal PICA aneurysm that was treated with coiling. During her hospital stay, she aspirated barium and developed aspiration pneumonia with episodic mucous plugging and desaturation after undergoing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent mucous plugging due to poor strength and weak cough, making it difficult for her to clear secretions. This could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia since the G-tube placement, which may be related to the PICA aneurysm and brainstem compression. This could result in difficulty swallowing and potential aspiration.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level ranging from 8.0-11.1 g/dL. It is important to monitor and address this condition to prevent further complications.
4. Urinary Retention: The patient has had urinary retention on transfer, and a Foley catheter has been replaced. This may indicate an ongoing issue with bladder function and requires further evaluation and management.
5. Left Kidney Cysts and Left Adrenal Incidentaloma: The patient has left kidney cysts and an adrenal incidentaloma. Further characterization through an"

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. He has a history of fatigue, cough, and wheezing. Vital signs show a blood pressure of 153/54 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is receiving tube feeds and has been on meropenem antibiotics since 06:23 AM. His fluid balance shows an intake of 1,693 mL (total in) and an output of 2,115 mL (total out), resulting in a negative balance of 422 mL. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels at 0.7 mg/dL, and decreased fibrinogen at 590 mg/dL. The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are slightly elevated, while other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with no desaturation episodes as of 03:00 AM. The patient is alert and responsive, with symmetric chest expansion and breath sounds clear to auscultation. However, there are diminished breath sounds in both lower extremities, indicating potential peripheral vascular complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm and underwent coiling. However, her hospital course was complicated by aspiration of barium resulting in aspiration pneumonia, episodes of mucous plugging, and desaturation following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to recurrent mucous plugging with poor strength and weak cough, making it difficult for her to clear her secretions. She has had several episodes of desaturation since extubation, which improves with chest physiotherapy (PT) and deep suctioning. She completed 14 days of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for aspiration pneumonia and has been on meropenem since April 10th due to episodes of hypoxia, thick purulent secretions, and a slight increase in white blood cell count with low-grade fever.

The patient also has dysphagia secondary to PICA aneurysm and brainstem compression. She is currently on tube feeds through a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) and is at goal. A repeat swallow study at a rehabilitation facility has been planned once her strength improves.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is fatigue, and there have been no significant changes in their medical or family history. The patient's allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other ICU medications are noted. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for constitutional fatigue.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5Â°C (99.5Â°F), a heart rate of 78 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 128/39-157/110 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 97% on a face tent. The patient is receiving tube feeds and is being monitored for fluid balance.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment, all of which were not assessed. The patient's labs show normal ranges for hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Other lab results indicate abnormal levels of creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and some electrolytes.

Assessment and plan include impaired airway clearance, balance, gait, knowledge, muscle performance, transfers, and ventilation. The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. Her hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium, resulting in aspiration pneumonia, mucous plugging, and desaturation. She also had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent mucous plugging due to poor strength and weak cough, making it difficult for her to clear secretions. She has had several episodes of desaturation since extubation. Mucus plugging improves with chest physiotherapy (PT) and deep suctioning. She completed 14 days of vancomycin and zosyn for aspiration pneumonia. She is now on meropenem due to episodes of hypoxia, thick purulent secretions, and slight increase in white blood cell count with low-grade fever. The plan is to wean off high flow oxygen, use albuterol and ipratropium nebs standing, administer Mucomyst as needed, perform chest PT, use an incentive spirometer, and an acapella device. The patient should receive aggressive PT if out of bed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted for a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. Her hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium, leading to aspiration pneumonia, episodes of mucous plugging, and desaturation after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent mucous plugging, poor strength, and weak cough make it difficult for her to clear secretions, leading to episodes of desaturation. She requires aggressive chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning to manage this condition.

2. Dysphagia: The patient's dysphagia is likely related to the placement of a G-tube and potential brainstem compression due to the large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm. She would benefit from a repeat swallow study at a rehabilitation center once her respiratory status is maximized.

3. Anxiety/Depression: The patient has experienced depression during her admission, affecting her overall motivation. She is currently on citalopram and xanax, and social work and psychiatry consultations have been arranged.

4. Left PICA Aneurysm: The patient underwent coiling of a large left proximal poplite"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. Her hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium, leading to aspiration pneumonia, episodes of mucus plugging, and desaturation after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's main medical issues include respiratory failure, dysphagia, anxiety/depression, left proximal popliteal artery (L PICA) aneurysm post-coiling, anemia, urinary retention, left kidney cysts, left adrenal incidentaloma, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenting, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is receiving supplemental oxygen. She is tolerating tube feeds and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 81-99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/42-145/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and recent aspiration pneumonia, which increases"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing recurrent mucous plugging with poor strength and weak cough, making it difficult to clear secretions. This has led to episodes of desaturation and respiratory failure.

2. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia following G-tube placement, likely related to the PICA aneurysm and brainstem compression. This is affecting the patient's ability to swallow and eat properly.

3. Anxiety/Depression: The patient has been experiencing depression during this admission, which seems to be affecting their overall motivation. They are currently on citalopram and xanax for anxiety and depression management.

4. Left PICA aneurysm: The patient had a large left proximal PICA aneurysm that was treated with coiling. Serial head CT scans post-procedure have been stable, but the patient will require rehabilitation due to residual deficits.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are within a range of 22-28%, indicating anemia. However, there are no signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.

6. Urinary retention: The patient has had urinary retention on transfer, and a Foley catheter has been placed. They will likely go to rehab with the Foley catheter and have urology follow-up.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of PVD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and COPD.
- She was admitted for a large left proximal PICA aneurysm that was treated with coiling.
- The hospital course was complicated by aspiration of barium, resulting in aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient has had episodes of mucous plugging and desaturation since extubation.
- She completed 14 days of vancomycin and zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.
- A G-tube was placed due to a high aspiration risk.
- The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to recurrent mucous plugging and poor strength.
- She is also experiencing dysphagia, anxiety, depression, and urinary retention.
- Other medical issues include anemia, left kidney cysts, left adrenal incidentaloma, PVD with SMA stenting, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension/tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to recurrent mucous plugging and poor strength. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential ARDS if not managed properly.
2. Dysphagia: The patient's dysphagia may worsen if she is not able to clear secretions effectively, leading to aspiration pneumonia or other complications related to swallowing difficulties.
3. Anxiety/Depression: If left untreated, the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that was treated with coiling. Her hospital course has been complicated by aspiration of barium, resulting in aspiration pneumonia with recurrent mucous plugging and desaturation episodes since percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing recurrent mucous plugging with poor strength and weak cough, making it difficult for her to clear her secretions. She has had several episodes of desaturation since extubation due to mucus plugging, which improves with chest physiotherapy (PT) and deep suctioning. She completed 14 days of vancomycin (Vanc) and zinc (Zosyn) for aspiration pneumonia. Recommendations include weaning off high-flow oxygen, using albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, administering Mucomyst three times daily to assist with breaking up secretions, performing chest PT, using an incentive spirometer, employing an acapella device, providing aggressive PT, and obtaining a chest X-ray to rule out any new findings.

2. Dysphagia s/p G-tube placement: The patient has dysphagia related to her PICA aneurys"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with a large left proximal popliteal artery aneurysm that underwent coiling. Her hospital course was complicated by aspiration of barium, leading to aspiration pneumonia with episodic mucous plugging and desaturation after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to recurrent mucous plugging, poor strength, and weak cough. She has had several episodes of desaturation since extubation, which improves with chest physiotherapy and deep suctioning. The patient completed 14 days of vancomycin and zosyn for aspiration pneumonia and has a G-tube in place due to concern for high aspiration risk.

The patient's plan of care includes weaning off high flow oxygen, using albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, Mucomyst three times a day to assist with breaking up secretions, chest physiotherapy, incentive spirometer, acapella device, and out-of-bed activities with aggressive physical therapy. A chest X-ray should be checked to monitor progress.

The patient also has dysphagia post G-tube placement, which is likely related to the popliteal artery aneurysm and brainstem compression"
