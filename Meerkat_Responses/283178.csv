   feasible given tenting along right hemidiaphragm.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with CAD, HL, and chronic renal insufficiency admitted to
   the ICU with one month fatigue, chills, and new hypotension requiring
   pressors.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  No clear source of infection but patient is febrile
   to 103 on admission.  Blood pressure improved with IVF, off pressors.
   - ivfs
   - empiric vanco/ceftriaxone pending culture data
   - trend lactate
   - f/u blood, urine cultures
   .
   2.  Fatigue. Patient reports history of fatigue for several weeks.
   Though he denies weight loss, records demonstrate 10 pound weight loss
   over one month.  Has history of pancreatic and colon cancer.  Most
   recent [**Last Name (un) **] was negative in [**2177**].  PSA normal in [**1-28**].  New macrocytic
   anemia with unusual diff and labs consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease raises the possibility of a heme malignancy.  No clear evidence
   of infection, but fever to 103 raises possibility of infection.
   - f/u cultures
   - empiric vanco/ceftriaxone pending culture data
   - spep, upep given anemia, renal failure
   .
   3.  Fevers.  No clear souce of infection.  UA and CXR negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.
   - f/u culture data
   - empiric vanco/ceftriaxone given he is on pressors
   .
   3. Anemia.  Labs consistent with anemia of chornic disease.
   - trend hct
   .
   4.  Acute on chronic renal failure. Likely secondary to hypovolemia.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose all meds
   - trend cr
   .
   4.  Thyroid function.  Low normal TSH with low free T4.  Given that TSH
   is more sensitive, most likely euthryoid.
   .
   5.  Hyperlipidemia.
   - continue simvastatin
   .
   6.  CAD. Patient denies chest pain.  EKG with some TW flattening in II,
   III, F which improved with rate control and fluids.
   - continue aspirin
   - trend enzymes
   - repeat EKG

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), chronic renal insufficiency, and previous pancreatic and colon cancer. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to fatigue, chills, hypotension, and required pressors. 

The patient's current condition includes septic shock, fatigue, fevers, anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, thyroid function abnormalities, hyperlipidemia, and CAD. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, progression of anemia, and potential cardiac events related to CAD. 

Further evaluation is recommended to identify the source of infection, investigate the cause of fatigue and anemia, monitor and manage renal function, and assess cardiac status."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was admitted to the ICU with complaints of fatigue and abnormal thyroid function tests (TFTs). They were also hypotensive upon admission. The patient's condition has improved over the past 24 hours, with successful weaning off pressors, good urine output, and creatinine levels returning to baseline with intravenous fluids (IVFs). The central venous pressure (CVP) has decreased from 10 to 1.

The patient has allergies to Zocor (Simvastatin) due to increased liver enzymes. They were last given antibiotics, specifically Vancomycin, on [**2184-3-7**] at 08:29 AM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/60 to 92/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 7,367 mL and total output of 1,110 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a non-rebreather mask, and their ABG results show pH 7.20.

   feasible given tenting along right hemidiaphragm.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with CAD, HL, and chronic renal insufficiency admitted to
   the ICU with one month fatigue, chills, and new hypotension requiring
   pressors.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  No clear source of infection but patient is febrile
   to 103 on admission.  WBC is suprisingly normal with 66% neutrophils,
   2% bands, and 5% atypicals.  Patient denies any localizing symptoms.
   CXR and UA are negative.  Alternative explanation for hypotension is
   dehdyration from several weeks of fevers/chills.  Also, history is
   concerning for occult malignancy, smoldering infection, or
   rheumatological disease.  Off levophed

   2.  Fatigue. Patient reports history of fatigue for several weeks.
   Though he denies weight loss, records demonstrate 10 pound weight loss
   over one month.  Has history of pancreatic and colon cancer.  Most
   recent [**Last Name (un) **] was negative in [**2177**].  PSA normal in [**1-28**].  New macrocytic
   anemia with unusual diff and labs consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease raises the possibility of a heme malignancy.  No clear evidence
   of infection, but fever to 103 raises possibility of infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with fever and hypotension, which indicates a possible infection and low blood volume. The patient was admitted to the ICU and received intravenous fluids to address the hypovolemia. Pressors were also used for resuscitation. The patient's vital signs stabilized, but there is still concern for an ongoing infection due to the presence of fever, bandemia (presence of bands on a blood differential), and a history of shaking chills. No localized signs of infection were found, so broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. Blood cultures were obtained, and cardiac enzymes were checked, ruling out a myocardial infarction. The patient's chronic renal failure worsened due to intravascular volume depletion and possible sepsis. The patient's hemoglobin level decreased, indicating anemia. The plan includes monitoring urine output, electrolytes, and repeating the hemoglobin level. The patient is critically ill and will be transferred to the floor once stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the fever, bandemia, and history of shaking chills, there is a concern for an ongoing infection leading to sepsis. Monitoring for signs of organ dysfunction and continued antibiotic coverage will be important.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated further, likely due to intravascular volume depletion and sepsis. Close monitoring of renal parameters and aggressive fluid management will be necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of fatigue, chills, and new-onset hypotension requiring pressors. The patient's blood pressure improved with intravenous fluids (IVF), and he is currently off pressors. The patient's fever has subsided, but no clear source of infection has been identified. Blood cultures are pending. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Septic shock: Empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone have been started pending culture data. The patient's trend lactate, follow-up blood cultures, and continue IVFs as needed for hypotension.
2. Fatigue: The patient reports a history of fatigue for several weeks. Although he denies weight loss, records show a 10-pound weight loss over one month. He has a history of pancreatic and colon cancer. The new macrocytic anemia with an unusual differential and labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease raise the possibility of a heme malignancy. No clear evidence of infection, but fever to 103 raises the possibility of infection. Follow-up cultures, empirical vancomycin/ceftriaxone, and follow-up SPEP/UEP are planned.
3. Fevers: No clear source of infection has been identified. Urinalysis (UA) and chest X-ray ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with sepsis and no clear identified source. He has shown some improvement in hemodynamics but still has persistent low-grade fevers and tachycardia. There is a concern for an ongoing infectious source. The patient's ESR is elevated, and non-infectious sources will also be explored for clinical decline. The patient will continue on vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and pressors will be weaned off. The patient will be taken out of bed for ambulation and a trial IV fluid bolus will be given for increased heart rate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial admission was with sepsis, and although there has been some improvement, the persistent low-grade fevers and tachycardia suggest that there may still be an ongoing infectious source. This could lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing confusion and impaired visual field deficits. This could be due to various causes including central nervous system infection, metabolic disturbances, or hypoxic injury. Further evaluation with neurology is recommended to consider potential sources and determine appropriate management.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylactic UF heparin for DVT. Given the patient's immobilization and risk factors, there is a potential for"
