   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with worsened hypercarbia
   upon evaluation today.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given
   recent injury but last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that
   has been untreated but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at
   home.  Other considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture
   and off Lovenox) vs PNA.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who fell and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis. She was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis and required non-invasive ventilation. She has a history of bleeding and clotting, and her current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, fall with multiple fractures and lacerations, hypothermia, acute kidney injury, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, Crohn's disease, possible pulmonary embolism, and loss of vision/cataracts.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This can result in respiratory acidosis and further complications such as hypoxemia (low oxygen levels) and respiratory distress.
2. Fall with multiple fractures and lacerations: The patient's fall has caused multiple fractures and lacerations, which may lead to complications such as infection, impaired mobility, and increased risk of pressure ulcers.
3. Hypothermia: The patient experienced hypothermia, which can be associated with reduced metabolic function, increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, and impaired organ function.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is compromised, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (reduced urine output). This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased risk of"

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who fell and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis. She was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive ventilation. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications, including:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbia worsened upon evaluation today. Possible causes include narcotics use, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary embolism (PE), or pneumonia (PNA). The patient is being treated with vanc/cefepime and will continue with noninvasive ventilation if pH < 7.2 or CO2 > 65.
2. Fall with multiple fractures and laceration: The patient became more sleepy with oxycodone, so it was discontinued.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. She has sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis after falling out of bed. The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics for suspected infections, pain management, and treatment for her underlying conditions. Her current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, multiple fractures, positive blood cultures for GPC, hypothermia, oliguria, acute on chronic renal failure, acute on chronic anemia, Crohn's disease flare-up, history of PE/DVT, loss of vision/cataracts, decubitus ulcer, and is on DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypercarbia indicates inadequate ventilation. If not addressed, it can lead to further respiratory acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications such as increased intracranial pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory arrest.
2. Infections: The presence of positive blood cultures for GPC suggests a possible bloodstream infection. If not treated appropriately, this could lead to sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure.
3. Oliguria: The patient's intermittent oliguria may indicate kidney dysfunction. If not managed properly, it can progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with worsened hypercarbia
   upon evaluation today.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given
   recent injury but last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that
   has been untreated but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at
   home.  Other considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture
   and off Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP, continue
   vanc/cefepime and DC flagyl  (terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued
   [**2195-4-2**]
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Positive Blood Cultures: GPC in pairs and clusters, [**2-2**]: likely
   contaminant, will await speciation, already on vanco.
   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q8
    - Continue abx as above
    - Send C.diff x 3
    - CXR to evaluate for pulmonary process --> with e/o new
   consolidation, will treat for HAP as above
    - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  UA from catheter concerning infection, awaiting urine
   culture.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
 morphine
   prn
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
   Baseline Cr 2.2.  Upon transfer patient is getting D5/NS at 125mL/hr.
    - Monitor urine output
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   - Goal for fluid is negative, continue to monitor and treat with lasix
   if needed
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.9 today, baseline is
   2.2. Per renal, somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound
   without hydronephrosis.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 4U PRBC prior to transfer to the
   ICU.
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: Currently with diarrhea, though may be related to Kayexelate
   given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - f/u C. Diff culture, hold flagyl
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant lacerations and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.   She has IVC filter.
    - follow Hct
   - hold lovenox for now
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Mattress
    - Wound Care recs
   # FEN: IVF prn / Replete PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia / NPO while
   mental status poor
   # Prophylaxis:
    - DVT
 IVC filter, hold heparin/lovenox
    - Bowel regimen
    - PPI given steroids

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who fell and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis. She was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis and is now being treated for HAP, as shown by the new consolidation on her chest X-ray. The patient's blood cultures grew out GPC in pairs and clusters, which are likely contaminants, awaiting speciation. She is already on vancomycin.

The patient has a history of bleeding and clotting disorders, which could contribute to her current condition. She has a femur fracture and was not on Loveliness, putting her at risk for a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute renal failure (ARF), with a baseline creatinine level of 2.2, which has improved to 2.9 today. Her urine output is intermittent and poor, possibly related to her CKD and ARF.

The patient's recent blood loss has led to acute blood anemia, requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). She has a history of myelodysplastic disorder and has experienced blood loss through multiple ecchymoses/hematomas. Steroids have been increased to manage her chronic steroid use for Crohn's disease.

The patient's recent fall has resulted in multiple fractures, including an intra-articular right knee/fem"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with improved VBG this
   morning.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given recent injury but
   last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that has been untreated
   but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at home.  Other
   considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture and off
   Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP
   -  continue vanc/cefepime (No flagyl d/t terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   - consider lasix in next several days
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued
   [**2195-4-2**]
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Positive Blood Cultures: GPC in pairs and clusters, [**2-2**]: likely
   contaminant, will await speciation, already on vanco. Treat HAP as
   above.
   - f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   - echo if high grade bacteremia
   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q8
    - Continue abx as above
    - Send C.diff x 3
    - CXR to evaluate for pulmonary process --> with e/o new
   consolidation, will treat for HAP as above
    - Follow-up cultures
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  UA from catheter concerning infection, awaiting urine
   culture.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
 morphine

    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
   Baseline Cr 2.2.  Upon transfer patient is getting D5/NS at 125mL/hr.
    - Monitor urine output
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   - Goal for fluid is negative, continue to monitor and treat with lasix
   if needed
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.7 today, baseline is
   2.2. Per renal, somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound
   without hydronephrosis.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 4U PRBC prior to transfer to the
   ICU.
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily

   given for hyperkalemia
    - mesalamine PO
   - Increased steroids as above
    - f/u C. Diff culture, hold flagyl
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant lacerations and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.   She has IVC filter.
    - follow Hct
   - hold lovenox for now
 considering IVC filter
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, multiple fractures, and ecchymosis. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis and is being treated with non-invasive ventilation.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially had improved VBG (ventilatory blood gases) this morning, but still requires monitoring and consideration of other causes such as OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) or PE (pulmonary embolism). Treatment includes continuing non-invasive ventilation if pH < 7.2 or CO2 > 65.

2. Fall with multiple fractures and laceration: The patient sustained multiple fractures and lacerations from a fall. She was treated with 7 days of cefazolin per Ortho recs and then discontinued. Pain management is scheduled with Tylenol and morphine as needed.

3. Positive blood cultures: The patient has GPC in pairs and clusters, suspecting contaminant, with speciation pending. She is already on vancomycin, and treatment for HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia) is being initiated.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of 2.1 L. Treatment includes a 1 L"

Fall with multiple fractures and lacerations: The patient sustained intraarticular right knee/femur fracture, right elbow fracture, head injury, and deep laceration to the right arm and tear of the left leg. She was treated with oxycodone but became more sleepy, so it was discontinued. She received 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs, which was also discontinued. Pain management will be continued with Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO) and morphine PRN. Ortho recs will be followed up in 2 weeks with Dr. [Doctor Last Name 3234] at [Telephone/Fax (1) 11762].

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. She sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis after falling out of bed. The patient has several ongoing medical issues including hypercarbic respiratory failure, fall-related injuries, positive blood cultures, hypothermia, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, anemia, Crohn's disease, history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, loss of vision, decubitus ulcer, and DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and noninvasive ventilation may be required if pH < 7.2 or CO2 > 65.
2. Fall-related injuries: The patient has multiple fractures and ecchymosis, indicating a high risk for further falls and subsequent injuries. Proper pain management and mobility precautions should be implemented.
3. Positive blood cultures: The patient has GPC in pairs and clusters, likely indicating a bacterial infection. Antibiotics should be continued, and follow-up cultures should be done.
4. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia has resolved, but there is concern for possible infectious sepsis. Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and infection work-up should continue.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's intermittent oliguria and elevated creatinine levels"

   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with improved VBG this
   morning.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given recent injury but
   last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that has been untreated
   but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at home.  Other
   considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture and off
   Lovenox) vs PNA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. She sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis after falling out of bed and was transferred to the ICU. The patient has a history of bleeding and clotting disorders. She has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and vitamin supplements. The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, fall with multiple fractures and lacerations, positive blood cultures, hypothermia, acute kidney injury, and anemia. The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, loss of vision/cataracts, decubitus ulcer, and is on chronic renal failure and anemia medications. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of respiratory acidosis and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. This increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Delirium: The patient's fluctuating mental status and altered level of consciousness may indicate delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or metabolic abnormalities.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Despite having an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, the patient's history of DVT and immobilization due to fractures increase the risk of developing another DVT.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening renal function and oliguria indicate the possibility of AKI, which could be due to multiple factors like hypotension, infection, or nephrotoxic medications.
5. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and fever suggest a possible bloodstream infection, and the presence of new consolidation on chest X-ray indicates a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's poor oral intake and chronic illnesses increase the risk of malnutrition.
8. Medication Reactions: The patient has allergies to certain medications, including Belladonna Alkaloids and Flagyl, which need to be taken into consideration when prescribing medications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, mental status, and nutritional status. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent complications such as pneumonia, delirium, DVT, AKI, and pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with improved VBG this
   morning.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given recent injury but
   last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that has been untreated
   but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at home.  Other
   considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture and off
   Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP
   -  continue vanc/cefepime (No flagyl d/t terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   - consider lasix in next several days
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued
   [**2195-4-2**]
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Positive Blood Cultures: GPC in pairs and clusters, [**2-2**]: likely
   contaminant, will await speciation, already on vanco. Treat HAP as
   above.
   - f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   - echo if high grade bacteremia
   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q8
    - Continue abx as above
    - Send C.diff x 3
    - CXR to evaluate for pulmonary process --> with e/o new
   consolidation, will treat for HAP as above
    - Follow-up cultures
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  UA from catheter concerning infection, awaiting urine
   culture.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
 morphine
   prn
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
   Baseline Cr 2.2.  This AM Creatinine 2.4
    - Monitor urine output
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   - Goal for fluid is negative, continue to monitor and treat with lasix
   if needed
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.7 today, baseline is
   2.2. Per renal, somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound
   without hydronephrosis.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 4U PRBC prior to transfer to the
   ICU.
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: Currently with diarrhea, though may be related to Kayexelate
   given for hyperkalemia
    - mesalamine PO
   - Increased steroids as above
    - f/u C. Diff culture, hold flagyl
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant lacerations and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.   She has IVC filter.
    - follow Hct
   - hold lovenox for now
 considering IVC filter
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. She sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis after falling out of bed and has since developed several medical complications. These include a positive blood culture with gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, likely contaminant; hypothermia; acute on chronic renal failure; acute on chronic anemia; suspected multifactorial delirium; oliguria; and an acute exacerbation of Crohn's disease. The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, loss of vision, decubitus ulcer, and is on chronic steroids for Crohn's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures indicating a possible infection. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 2.2, which has increased to 2.4. She also has oliguria and is showing signs of acute on chronic renal failure.
3. Delirium: The patient is suspected to have multifactorial delirium due to various factors such as hypercarbia, infection, and chronic steroid use. It is important to avoid sedating medications while controlling pain and monitor for any changes.
4. Oliguria: The patient's intermittent oliguria may be related to poor oral intake and"
