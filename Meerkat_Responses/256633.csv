   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD
   on home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   concerning for pneumonia in setting of leukocytosis and bandemia.  As
   the patient has no recent hospitalizations and comes from home, was
   treated initially for CAP with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, which was
   converted to levofloxacin and clindamycin for CAP and aspiration
   coverage.  Patient is at aspiration risk given history of esophageal
   stricture.  No wheezing on exam concerning for COPD exacerbation, and
   patient does not have signs of volume overload.
   - Continue levofloxacin. Would favor holding clindamycin and following
   patient clinically, if decompensates would agree with covering for
   anaerobic.
   - Continue inhalers
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2 >88%. Baseline O2
   requirement of 2L nc.
   - F/u culture data
   - Speech and swallow study when stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis, tachycardia: Likely secondary to pulmonary infection
   with SIRS physiology.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - IVF as necessary
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: Lactate this AM 1 from 3.3 on initial presentation
   after volume rescucitation. Likely in the setting of sepsis as above.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine of 0.6.  In setting of
   sepsis and decreased effective intravascular volume, likely renal
   hypoperfusion. Urine Na <10, suggestiving volume depletion.
   - Trend creatinine
   - IVF as necessary.
   - Trend UOP.
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: In the setting of renal failure with normal EKG
   and asymptomology.
   - Cycle enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging
   by various medications. Would favor judicious use given current
   pulmonary process and concern for lowering respiratory drive with
   benzodiazepines.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine. Will hold Ativan for now
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.
   .
   # Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**].
   Previously on iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy
   in our system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed. Guaiac
   negative in the ED. Hct trended down overnight and the patient received
   1 unit PRBC.
   - Trend hct and transfuse for hct<21 or signs of end organ damage.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Iron studies.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of COPD, GERD, and a recent fall. She was admitted for hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. The patient has right-sided infiltrates on the chest X-ray, leukocytosis, and bandemia, suggesting pneumonia. She was initially treated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with aspiration coverage due to a history of esophageal stricture. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 95/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 0.98. The patient has a white blood cell count of 20.1 K/uL, hematocrit of 18.6%, platelet count of 408 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.05, and lactate of 1.0 mmol/L. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right-sided pneumonia with leukocytosis and bandemia.
2. Acute renal failure with baseline creatinine of 0.6.
3. Lactic acidosis with a lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L.
4. Elevated troponin T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury.
5. Anemia with a history of iron deficiency anemia and recent decline in hematocrit.
6. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization.
7. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Risk of stress ulcer due to ICU stay.
9. Risk of falls due to decreased vision and non-compliance with walker.
10. Anxiety and depression, which may complicate recovery.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, renal function, fluid balance, infection, and other comorbidities. The potential medical complications should be closely watched for and managed accordingly."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of COPD, GERD, and a previous fall who was admitted for hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia without evidence of cavitation, partial right middle and left lower lobe atelectasis, small bilateral pleural effusions, and prominent mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, positive blood cultures, and has been receiving antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. She is also on supplemental oxygen and breathing treatments. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, leukocytosis, and a slightly elevated lactate level. She has a history of iron deficiency anemia and acute renal failure, both of which have been addressed. The patient's troponin levels are elevated but unchanged, and she may be experiencing demand ischemia. She has significant anxiety and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. The patient recently experienced a fall, which was multifactorial in nature. Her current medications include pantoprazole, ASA, Elena, quetiapine, duloxetine, and ativan for anxiety or withdrawal symptoms. The patient is on mechanical soft restraints in the ICU and is being closely monitored.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia. Given positive blood cultures, likely
   pneumococcal lobar pneumonia with resulting bacteremia, although
   S.aureus cannot be ruled out at this time.  No wheezing on exam
   concerning for COPD exacerbation and patient does not have signs of
   volume overload. Patinet spiked to 101 overnight and was re-cultured.
   Currently on 50% shovel mask and 6L nc.
   - Vanco, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.  Plan to narrow coverage when
   culture data returns.
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Speech and swallow when stable
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>90%
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient remains tachycardic. Leukocytosis this AM stable.
   Otherwise hemodynamically stable with normalized lactate after volume
   rescucitation.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - Trend WBC and fever curve
   - Trend UOP.
   - Goal TBB even to -500 today.
   .
   # Anemia: History of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed on labs in [**2162**].
   Previously on iron that was stopped for unclear reasons. No colonoscopy
   in our system, but patient has had a history of UGI bleed. Guaiac
   negative in the ED. Patient received 1 unit PBRC during LOS. Serum
   Fe/TIBC 3%.
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue supplemental ferrous sulfate
   - Outpatient colonoscopy
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with fluid challenge.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP.
   .
   # Elevated troponins: Unchanged ECG, CK flat with TnT down to 0.03 from
   0.05.  Likely component of demand ischemia in setting of sepsis with
   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # Anxiety/Depression: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging
   by various medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement
   concerning for withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of COPD, GERD, and a recent fall. She was admitted for hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, positive blood cultures, and multi-focal pneumonia with small bilateral pleural effusions. She is currently receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone, and is being closely monitored for any changes in her condition.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multi-focal pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially progress to sepsis if not effectively treated.

2. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia and leukocytosis indicate ongoing inflammation and infection, putting her at risk for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued appropriate antibiotic therapy will be crucial in managing this condition.

3. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, which requires ongoing management. It is important to maintain iron supplementation and consider further evaluation for potential sources of gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient previously experienced acute renal failure, which has since resolved with fluid resuscitation. Continued monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent recurrence.

5. Elevated Troponins: Although the troponin levels have decreased, they remain elevated. This could"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of COPD, GERD, and falls. She was admitted for hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in oxygen requirement. She has several medical complications including sepsis, anemia, acute renal failure, elevated troponins, anxiety/depression, and a recent fall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic and has leukocytosis, indicating an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, WBC count, fever curve, and UOP is necessary. Antibiotics should be continued as prescribed.
2. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia and received one unit of packed red blood cells during her hospital stay. Her Hct level has decreased from 25 yesterday to 23.2 this morning. It is important to maintain active T+S, continue supplemental ferrous sulfate, schedule an outpatient colonoscopy, and monitor guaiac stools.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure has resolved with fluid challenge. Monitoring of creatinine and UOP is necessary.
4. Elevated Troponins: Although the troponin levels have decreased, they remain elevated. The patient should be monitored on telemetry and continue taking ASA.
5. Anxiety/Depression: The patient seems to have significant anxiety, requiring a high dose of benzodiazep"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 65 year old female with a PMH significant for COPD on
   home O2, GERD, and [**Doctor First Name **] admitted for fall and hypoxia secondary to
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Right-Sided Infiltrates: CXR on admission with RML/RLL infiltrates
   consistent with pneumonia with blood cultures speciated with
   pneumococcus.  Oxygen requirement stable at 6L nc.
   - Continue levofloxacin and ceftriaxone pending sensitivities. Plan to
   narrow coverage to ceftriaxone (Legionella urinary antigen negative) if
   3^rd generation cephalosporin sensitive.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue breathing treatments
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated with goal SaO2>90%
   - Speech and swallow eval
   - Goal TBB even to -500 for day
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient remains tachycardic although trending down
   slightly. Leukocytosis this AM stable. Persistent tachycardia in
   setting of severe multi-lobar pneumonia likely related to infection,
   although other potential etiologies include pain,benzo withdrawal, and
   anemia. Low suspicion for PE, and hyperthyroid unlikely given TSH.
   - Antimicrobials as above
   - Oxycodone for pain
   - Ativan standing and PRN for benzo withdrawal.
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBC and assess for improvement in oxygenation and
   tachycardia.
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit trending down to 22.2 from 23.2 yesterday.  Guaiac
   negative.
   - As above, transfuse 1 unit PRBC
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Continue supplemental ferrous sulfate
   - Outpatient colonoscopy
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Psych: Patient seems to have significant anxiety judging by various
   medications.  Patient has significant benzo requirement concerning for
   withdrawal.
   - Continue Celexa, Quetiapine and Duloxetine.
   - Ativan 2 mg QID for anxiety or signs of withdrawal.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Resolved with fluid challenge.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP.
   .
   # Elevated troponins: Unchanged ECG, CK flat with TnT down to 0.03 from
   0.05.  Likely component of demand ischemia in setting of sepsis with
   baseline anemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA
   .
   # S/P Falls: Appears multifactorial - decreased vision, non-compliance
   with walker, complicated by oxygen tubing and likely acutely worsened
   in the setting of brewing infection. CT head and c-spine without
   bleeding or fractures.
   - PT eval when clinically stable
   - Patient may unsafe to return to independent living.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, GERD, and a recent fall and hypoxia secondary to pneumonia.
- She is currently admitted to the ICU for severe multi-lobar pneumonia with right-sided infiltrates, as seen on the CXR.
- The patient has been on home oxygen and is now requiring 6 liters of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.
- She has been started on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone for pneumonia, pending sensitivities.
- Her vital signs show persistent tachycardia, trending down, with a heart rate between 100-110 beats per minute.
- The patient's hematocrit is decreasing, indicating anemia, and she has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
- Her white blood cell count is elevated, indicating leukocytosis.
- The patient has elevated troponin levels, but her ECG remains unchanged, and her CK and TnT levels are decreasing.
- She has a history of anxiety and benzodiazepine withdrawal, for which she is receiving Ativan.
- The patient also has an acute renal failure that has resolved with a fluid challenge.
- She has experienced falls due to decreased vision and non-compliance with her walker, which were worsened by her infection.
- The patient's recent lab results show anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated troponin"
