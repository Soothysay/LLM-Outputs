   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8907**] is an 89 year old female with remote history of upper
   GI bleed, GERD, and anemia who is transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with
   hematemesis.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: s/p EGD which showed evidence of ischemic esophagitis,
   most likely secondary to brief hypotension. Other differential that
   were considered includes peptic ulcer disease (especially given she is
   listed as possibily taking Advil at night and received some in the ED),
   gastritis, ischemic esophagitis, aortic-enterofistula, AVM, malignancy
   (given family history, though family history is of colonic). No history
   of epistaxis or pulmonary source. Received 4u pRBC since transfer.
   - s/p RIJ for access
   - per GI, goal hct 30, maintain active T&S
   - continue carafate one gram slurries four times daily. protonix 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - HOB elevated
   - check PM hct, transfusion if hct ,30
   - f/u GI recs
   - IVF PRN hypotension/low urine output, etc, goal MAP>65, goal
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - Hold ASA, heparin SQ, NSAIDs, especially given pt is thrombocytopenic
   from dilutional effect
   - NPO for now, GI will provide recs on when to start PO
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient had initial marked hypotension in ED, which
   resolved and per report was not symptomatic, but it could have lead to
   ischemic esophagitis. Given her presentation of  fall, unclear if the
   fall was seconary to hypotension. Patient had a reason for hypotension
   post-hematemesis, but in terms of the etiologies of hypotension prior
   to hematemesis, patient has no history of Parkinson's Disease or DM to
   support diagnosis of autononmic dysfunction/dysregulation. No steroid
   use to support adrenal insufficiency. Could be secondary to anemia,
   slow bleed, and volume depletion, medication effect.
   - IVF PRN hypotension/low urine output, etc, goal MAP>65, goal
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - monitor CVP for goal >[**11-14**]
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plt dropped from 160 to 88 during the past 2 days.
   Pt received heparin when she was on the floor 2 days ago. Also got lots
   of fluids that could dilute plt, but the degree of drop cannot be
   solely accounted for by dilution. Pt is on terbinafene which can cause
   pancytopenia
   - f/u PF4 antibody
   - contineu to trend
   - avoid heparin for now
   .
   #) Fall: X-rays negative for any fractures. Continue pain control with
   tylenol PRN, calcium-vitamin D, PT consult once more stable.
   .
   #) Peripheral vascular disease: hold ASA for now
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Not currently on replacement therapy. Follow up
   ordered TSH by hospitalist team
   .
   #) Leg pain: Continue amytripyline
   .
   #) Onychomycosis: Continue terbenafine

   EGD.
   Code status: Full, as discussed with patient and son
   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement, stable HCT and BP, then
   transfer to floor
","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of upper GI bleed, GERD, and anemia. She was transferred to the ICU with hematemesis. The EGD showed evidence of ischemic esophagitis, most likely secondary to brief hypotension. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) since transfer. She underwent placement of a right internal jugular (RIJ) line for access. The goal hematocrit (Hct) is 30, and she is to be monitored actively. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 121/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,594 mL and a total output of 2,320 mL, resulting in a balance of 274 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids at a rate of 1,647 mL, blood products at a rate of 946 mL, and urine output is 2,320 mL. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, blood glucose of 100 mg/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, and a lactate level of 2.3 mmol/L. The PT/PTT/INR is 12.9/29.0/1.1, and LDH is 211 IU/L. Chest X-ray reveals a small left pleural effusion and a new right IJ line with tip at the cavoatrial junction. 

The patient's assessment includes hematemesis due to ischemic esophagitis, likely secondary to brief hypotension. Other differentials considered include peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, ischemic esophagitis, aortic-enteric fistula, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and malignancy. The patient received 4 units of pRBCs, underwent placement of an RIJ line, and was started on carafate and protonix. Her head of bed (HOB) was elevated, and she is to be monitored closely. 

The patient also has hypotension, thrombocytopenia (platelet count dropped from 160 to 88), and a fall. X-rays did not show any fractures, so pain control with Tylenol PRN was continued. Physical examination findings include alertness, clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes, supple neck, regular heart rhythm, clear lungs, soft abdomen, and slightly cool extremities with good pulses. 

The patient's care plan includes maintaining active tracking and surveillance, continuing carafate and protonix, elevating HOB, checking PM hct and transfusing if necessary, following up with GI recommendations, and monitoring for hypotension/low urine output. The patient is to be kept NPO for now, with GI recommendations for when to start PO intake."

   #) Hypotension: Patient had marked hypotension in ED, which resolved
   and per report was not symptomatic. Given her presentation after fall,
   unclear if they are related. No history of Parkinson's Disease or DM to
   support diagnosis of autononmic dysfunction/dysregulation. No steroid
   use to support adrenal insufficiency. Could be secondary to anemia and
   volume depletion, medication effect.
   - IVF/PRBC resuscitation as needed as detailed above. Would consider
   pressors (neo) if needed for BP support
   - Would consider further work up once hematemesis work-up and
   management is resolved--hypotension may be related to slow bleed, or
   unrelated process (eg echo), check CVP if CVL is placed
   .
   #) Fall: Continue pain control with tylenol PRN, calcium-vitamin D, PT
   consult once more stable. X-rays negative.

The patient underwent an EGD which showed evidence of ischemic esophagitis, likely secondary to brief hypotension. Other differential diagnoses considered include peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, ischemic esophagitis, aortic-enterofistula, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and malignancy. No history of epistaxis or pulmonary source was reported.

The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) since transfer and had a right internal jugular (RIJ) line placed for access. The goal hematocrit (Hct) is 30, and the patient is to maintain active temperature and blood sugar monitoring. The patient is to continue with carafate one gram slurries four times daily and protonix 40 mg. Her head of bed (HOB) is elevated, and she is to be monitored for any changes in her condition.

The patient also has hypotension, which was marked in the emergency department but resolved. It is unclear if the hypotension is related to the fall or if it is an unrelated process. The patient's blood pressure is to be supported with intravenous fluids (IVF) and/or packed red blood cells (pRBC) as needed. If necessary,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and anemia. She was transferred to the ICU with hematemesis, which is vomiting of blood. The initial endoscopy (EGD) showed evidence of ischemic esophagitis, likely secondary to brief hypotension. Other potential causes considered include peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, ischemic esophagitis, aortic-enteric fistula, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and malignancy. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) since transfer and underwent a second EGD, which confirmed ischemic injury to the esophagus. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hematemesis: The patient presented with vomiting of blood, indicating a significant upper GI bleed. The source was identified as ischemic esophagitis, but other differential diagnoses were considered due to her medical history and presentation.
2. Ischemic Esophagitis: The patient's EGD revealed black esophageal mucosa with sloughing in the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the esophagus. This suggests an ischemic injury to the esophagus, which could be related to the brief hypotension experienced.
3. Hypotension: The patient had initial marked hypotension in the emergency department, which resolved but could have led"

   (given family history, though family history is of colonic). No history
   of epistaxis or pulmonary source.
   - Two large bore IV's: patient currently with 18, 20, 22 [**Last Name (LF) 8908**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**]
   likely need additional access given difficulty, possibly central
   - Appreciate GI assistance--patient to be urgently scoped in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - 2 units of emergency release blood, type/screen send, likely 2
   additional units to get hematocrit back to baseline
   - IVF: LR 500 cc bolus now, then PRN hypotension/low urine output, etc
   - Hold off on NG lavage given GI to scope patient
   - Hold ASA, heparin SQ, NSAIDs
   - NPO
   - Discussed patient with IR in event bleeding cannot be treated/located
   on endoscopy
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient had marked hypotension in ED, which resolved
   and per report was not symptomatic. Given her presentation after fall,
   unclear if they are related. No history of Parkinson's Disease or DM to
   support diagnosis of autononmic dysfunction/dysregulation. No steroid
   use to support adrenal insufficiency. Could be secondary to anemia and
   volume depletion, medication effect.
   - IVF/PRBC resuscitation as needed as detailed above. Would consider
   pressors (neo) if needed for BP support
   - Would consider further work up once hematemesis work-up and
   management is resolved--hypotension may be related to slow bleed, or
   unrelated process (eg echo), check CVP if CVL is placed
   .
   #) Anemia: Per discussion with patient's son, endoscopy has been
   recommended but declined by the patient. She is on iron supplements.
   - Following q6-8 hour hematocrits
   - Transfusion as discussed above
   - Follow up studies ordered by hospitalist team

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.7%, platelet count of 88 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, total CO2 of 26 mmol/L, glucose of 117 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 2.3 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has been placed on NPO status and is being given intravenous fluids (LR 500 cc bolus now, then PRN hypotension/low urine output) and IV PPI. Two large bore IV's have been placed, and additional access may be needed due to difficulty in obtaining veins. The patient is also on prophylactic antibiotics for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and has been discussed with interventional radiology (IR) in case the bleeding cannot be treated/located on endoscopy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient may continue to experience bleeding from the esophagus, which can lead to further hematemesis and require additional blood transfusions.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the invasive procedures performed, such as EGD and the presence of a multi-lumen catheter.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may continue to be unstable, especially if there is ongoing blood loss or fluid shifts.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's renal function should be monitored closely due to the potential for acute kidney injury from hypotension, dehydration, or medications.
5. Pneumonia: Immobility and decreased oral intake can increase the risk of pneumonia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female who presented to the hospital with a fall and subsequent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, specifically brisk hematemesis. She was admitted to the ICU for further care. A procedure called EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) was performed, revealing a ""black esophagus"" with ulceration and sloughing, as well as a tear suggested as explanations for the GI bleed. The patient showed improvement in mental status following the procedure and recovery from sedating agents.

Assessment and Plan:
1) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)-
   -EGD completed
   -Continue on PPI (proton pump inhibitor)
   -Advance diet per GI (gastrointestinal) recommendations
   -Do have CVL (central venous line) in place
2) Altered Mental Status-
   -Improved through tonight into today with some mild residual somnolence and decreased motivation this morning but quite clear and oriented.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED: The patient's lower gastrointestinal bleed could potentially lead to further blood loss and anemia. Monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is crucial to identify any signs of hypotension or shock.
2) ALTERNATE MENTAL STATUS: The patient's altered mental status may continue to fluctuate due to factors such as sedating agents, underlying medical conditions, or complications from the GI bleed. Regular neurologic assessments are necessary to monitor any changes in mental status.
3) INFECTIONS: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to advanced age, sedation, and potential exposure to hospital-acquired pathogens. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or changes in vital signs, is important.
4) DEHYDRATION: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential dehydration. Careful monitoring of fluid intake and output is essential to prevent further dehydration and ensure adequate hydration.
5) COAGULATION ABNORMALITIES: The patient's elevated PT and PTT suggest coagulation abnormalities. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management to prevent bleeding complications are necessary.
6) NUTRITIONAL STATUS: The patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored, considering her age, recent illness, and potential inability to eat due to GI issues. Nutritional support may be required to maintain adequate nutritional intake.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided information, and a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition should be conducted by a healthcare professional."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8907**] is an 89 year old female with remote history of upper
   GI bleed, GERD, and anemia who is transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with
   hematemesis.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: s/p EGD which showed evidence of ischemic esophagitis,
   most likely secondary to brief hypotension. Other differential that
   were considered includes peptic ulcer disease (especially given she is
   listed as possibily taking Advil at night and received some in the ED),
   gastritis, ischemic esophagitis, aortic-enterofistula, AVM, malignancy
   (given family history, though family history is of colonic). No history
   of epistaxis or pulmonary source. Received 4u pRBC since transfer.
   - s/p RIJ for access
   - per GI, goal hct 30, maintain active T&S
   - continue carafate one gram slurries four times daily. protonix 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - HOB elevated
   - check PM hct, transfusion if hct <30
   - f/u GI recs
   - IVF PRN hypotension/low urine output, etc, goal MAP>65, goal
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - Hold ASA, heparin SQ, NSAIDs, especially given pt is thrombocytopenic
   from dilutional effect
   - start clear liquids today, do not advance diet beyond full liquids
   for 2 weeks
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient had initial marked hypotension in ED, which
   resolved and per report was not symptomatic, but it could have lead to
   ischemic esophagitis. Given her presentation of  fall, unclear if the
   fall was seconary to hypotension. Patient had a reason for hypotension
   post-hematemesis, but in terms of the etiologies of hypotension prior
   to hematemesis, patient has no history of Parkinson's Disease or DM to
   support diagnosis of autononmic dysfunction/dysregulation. No steroid
   use to support adrenal insufficiency. Could be secondary to anemia,
   slow bleed, and volume depletion, medication effect.
   - IVF PRN hypotension/low urine output, etc, goal MAP>65, goal
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - monitor CVP for goal >[**11-14**]
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plt dropped from 160 to 88 during the past 2 days.
   Pt received heparin when she was on the floor 2 days ago. Also got lots
   of fluids that could dilute plt, but the degree of drop cannot be
   solely accounted for by dilution. Pt is on terbinafene which can cause
   pancytopenia
   - f/u PF4 antibody
   - contineu to trend
   - avoid heparin for now
   .
   #) Asceding aortic aneurysm: OSH records showed 6cm ascending aortic
   aneurysm. Per report, patient didn
t want anything done about it.
   - clarify with patient regarding whether she wants anything done about
   the aneurysm
   - CTA on the floor if pt would like further workup and intervention
   .
   #) Fall: X-rays negative for any fractures. Continue pain control with
   tylenol PRN, calcium-vitamin D. Patient was seen by PT on [**10-20**].
   - fall precautions
   .
   #) Peripheral vascular disease: hold ASA for now given ischemic
   esophagitis
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Not currently on replacement therapy. TSH 11, most
   likely sick euthyroid syndrome
   - check T4
   .
   #) Leg pain: Continue amytripyline
   .
   #) Onychomycosis: Continue terbenafine

The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) since transfer. She has been started on clear liquids and will continue carafate one gram slurries four times daily, along with protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Her head of bed (HOB) has been elevated, and she is to be monitored for any changes in her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) with transfusion if Hct <30. Follow-up gastrointestinal (GI) recommendations have been provided.

The patient's hypotension is also noted, which could have led to ischemic esophagitis. She has no history of Parkinson's disease or diabetes to support a diagnosis of autonomic dysfunction/dysregulation, nor any steroid use to support adrenal insufficiency. The hypotension may be secondary to anemia, slow bleed,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8907**] is an 89 year old female with remote history of upper
   GI bleed, GERD, and anemia who is transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with
   hematemesis.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: s/p EGD which showed evidence of ischemic esophagitis,
   most likely secondary to brief hypotension. Other differential that
   were considered includes peptic ulcer disease (especially given she is
   listed as possibily taking Advil at night and received some in the ED),
   gastritis, ischemic esophagitis, aortic-enterofistula, AVM, malignancy
   (given family history, though family history is of colonic). No history
   of epistaxis or pulmonary source. Received 4u pRBC since transfer.
   - s/p RIJ for access
   - per GI, goal hct 30, maintain active T&S
   - continue carafate one gram slurries four times daily. protonix 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - HOB elevated
   - check PM hct, transfusion if hct <30
   - f/u GI recs
   - IVF PRN hypotension/low urine output, etc, goal MAP>65, goal
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - Hold ASA, heparin SQ, NSAIDs, especially given pt is thrombocytopenic
   from dilutional effect
   - NPO for now, GI will provide recs on when to start PO
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient had initial marked hypotension in ED, which
   resolved and per report was not symptomatic, but it could have lead to
   ischemic esophagitis. Given her presentation of  fall, unclear if the
   fall was seconary to hypotension. Patient had a reason for hypotension
   post-hematemesis, but in terms of the etiologies of hypotension prior
   to hematemesis, patient has no history of Parkinson's Disease or DM to
   support diagnosis of autononmic dysfunction/dysregulation. No steroid
   use to support adrenal insufficiency. Could be secondary to anemia,
   slow bleed, and volume depletion, medication effect.
   - IVF PRN hypotension/low urine output, etc, goal MAP>65, goal
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - monitor CVP for goal >[**11-14**]
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plt dropped from 160 to 88 during the past 2 days.
   Pt received heparin when she was on the floor 2 days ago. Also got lots
   of fluids that could dilute plt, but the degree of drop cannot be
   solely accounted for by dilution. Pt is on terbinafene which can cause
   pancytopenia
   - f/u PF4 antibody
   - contineu to trend
   - avoid heparin for now
   .
   #) Asceding aortic aneurysm: OSH records showed 6cm ascending aortic
   aneurysm:
   - CTA on the floor
   .
   #) Fall: X-rays negative for any fractures. Continue pain control with
   tylenol PRN, calcium-vitamin D, PT consult once more stable.
   .
   #) Peripheral vascular disease: hold ASA for now
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Not currently on replacement therapy.
   - TSH 11
   - will need thyroid replacement
   .
   #) Leg pain: Continue amytripyline
   .
   #) Onychomycosis: Continue terbenafine

","The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of upper GI bleed, GERD, and anemia who presented with hematemesis. She was transferred to the ICU with a diagnosis of ischemic esophagitis, possibly secondary to brief hypotension. Other differentials considered include peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, ischemic esophagitis, aortic-enterofistula, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), malignancy, and no history of epistaxis or pulmonary source. 

The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) since transfer. She also underwent a right internal jugular (RIJ) line placement for access. The goal hematocrit (Hct) is 30, and she will be maintained on active tissue and serum monitoring. Carafate one gram slurries are to be given four times daily, along with Protonix 40 mg [Hospital 1]. Her head of bed (HOB) is elevated, and she will be monitored for any changes in her hemodynamic status. 

The patient's hypotension is being managed with intravenous fluids (IVF) as needed for hypotension/low urine output, with goals of maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and urine output (UOP) >30 cc/hr. She has been advised to hold aspirin, heparin subcutaneously, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NS"

The patient is an 89-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She presented with hematemesis and black esophagus seen on endoscopy. The patient has been tolerating a negative fluid balance and has shown improvement in breathing with diuresis. She is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) and lorazepam (Ativan). Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 105/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 88 K/uL, platelet count of 88 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L. The assessment and plan include managing the GI bleed, thrombocytopenia, congestive heart failure, and altered mental status. The patient is on carafate and pantoprazole, and further evaluation with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be done to confirm resolution of the GI bleed. She is also being monitored for thrombocytopenia, congestive heart failure, and altered mental status. The patient's nutritional needs will be addressed once her npo status"

The patient is a 64-inch tall and 89 kg individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/51 mmHg to 139/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is receiving various medications and fluids through infusions and has been monitored closely for hemodynamics, fluid balance, respiratory function, and other parameters.

The patient's weight has increased from 70 kg upon admission to 89 kg currently. The central venous pressure (CVP) is low at 1 mmHg, indicating potential fluid resuscitation needs. The total fluid input is 1,945 mL, while the total fluid output is 2,035 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -90 mL. The patient's urine output is within an acceptable range.

The patient's laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, slightly elevated white blood cell count, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits, except for prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), indicating potential coagulopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 8907**] is an 89 year old female with remote history of upper
   GI bleed, GERD, and anemia who is transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] with
   hematemesis.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: s/p EGD which showed evidence of ischemic esophagitis,
   most likely secondary to brief hypotension. Other differential that
   were considered includes peptic ulcer disease (especially given she is
   listed as possibily taking Advil at night and received some in the ED),
   gastritis, ischemic esophagitis, aortic-enterofistula, AVM, malignancy
   (given family history, though family history is of colonic). No history
   of epistaxis or pulmonary source. Received 4u pRBC since transfer.
   - s/p RIJ for access
   - per GI, goal hct 30, maintain active T&S
   - continue carafate one gram slurries four times daily. protonix 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - HOB elevated
   - check PM hct, transfusion if hct <30
   - f/u GI recs
   - IVF PRN hypotension/low urine output, etc, goal MAP>65, goal
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - Hold ASA, heparin SQ, NSAIDs, especially given pt is thrombocytopenic
   from dilutional effect
   - start clear liquids today, do not advance diet beyond full liquids
   for 2 weeks
   .
   #) Hypotension: Patient had initial marked hypotension in ED, which
   resolved and per report was not symptomatic, but it could have lead to
   ischemic esophagitis. Given her presentation of  fall, unclear if the
   fall was seconary to hypotension. Patient had a reason for hypotension
   post-hematemesis, but in terms of the etiologies of hypotension prior
   to hematemesis, patient has no history of Parkinson's Disease or DM to
   support diagnosis of autononmic dysfunction/dysregulation. No steroid
   use to support adrenal insufficiency. Could be secondary to anemia,
   slow bleed, and volume depletion, medication effect.
   - IVF PRN hypotension/low urine output, etc, goal MAP>65, goal
   UOP>30cc/hr
   - monitor CVP for goal >[**11-14**]
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia: Plt dropped from 160 to 88 during the past 2 days.
   Pt received heparin when she was on the floor 2 days ago. Also got lots
   of fluids that could dilute plt, but the degree of drop cannot be
   solely accounted for by dilution. Pt is on terbinafene which can cause
   pancytopenia. PFT4 antibody neg.
   - contineu to trend
   .
   #) Asceding aortic aneurysm: OSH records showed 6cm ascending aortic
   aneurysm. Per report, patient didn
t want anything done about it.
   - clarify with patient regarding whether she wants anything done about
   the aneurysm
   - CTA on the floor if pt would like further workup and intervention
   .
   #) Fall: X-rays negative for any fractures. Continue pain control with
   tylenol PRN, calcium-vitamin D. Patient was seen by PT on [**10-20**].
   - fall precautions
   .
   #) Peripheral vascular disease: hold ASA for now given ischemic
   esophagitis
   .
   #) Hypothyroidism: Not currently on replacement therapy. TSH 11, T4:
   6.6.  most likely sick euthyroid syndrome
   - check T4
   .
   #) Leg pain: Continue amytripyline
   .
   #) Onychomycosis: Continue terbenafine

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of upper GI bleed, GERD, and anemia. She was admitted to the ICU with hematemesis and evidence of ischemic esophagitis. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD). She also had a right internal jugular (RIJ) central line placed for access. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been fluctuating, with values ranging from 25.7% to 29.4%. Her platelet count has dropped from 160 to 88 during the past 2 days. She is currently on terbinafine, which can cause pancytopenia. The patient has a history of a 6cm ascending aortic aneurysm, but she does not want any intervention at this time. She also has negative PFT4 antibody, indicating that she is not a candidate for thyroid replacement therapy. The patient has been experiencing leg pain and has a history of onychomycosis. She is on pain control with Tylenol PRN and calcium-vitamin D supplementation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 98/51 mmHg to 137/62 mmHg, heart rate between 68 and 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 19 and 22 breaths per minute"
