   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with SCC of the tongue recently finished chemo and
   undergoing XRT, who presents with chronic n/v related to his gtube as
   well as newly diagnosed PE and fevers.
   .
   #. PE: documented PE by CTA.  Chest pain less likely cardiac given
   history, known PE, first set of negative enzymes, and similar EKG.
   Underlying risk factors for PE include SCC, recent chemo/XRT, and
   reduced mobility at home [**1-7**] treatment- and poor nutrition-induced
   fatigue. Pt started on heparin gtt. Head CT did not show any acute
   abnormalities that would be concerning for bleed.
   - heparin IV drip by weight-based protocol
   - discuss long term anticoagulation with oncologist (coumadin vs.
   Lovenox)
   .
   #. Fevers: potentially related to PE, but pna also in differential.  UA
   negative and BCx pending.  He is not neutrapenic by CBC/diff.  Received
   cefepime and levofloxacin in the ED.  Given likely immunosuppression
   and recent hospitalization, would favor covering broadly for HCAP for
   now.
   - continue cefepime, levo, vancomycin
   .
   #. N/V: Pt had appointment with radiology on thursday to advance tube
   - discuss with GI, possibly do procedure earlier in the week
   - nutrition consult.
   .
   #. SCC: s/p chemo, undergoing xrt.
   - heme/onc consult in AM

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, who recently completed chemotherapy (chemo) and is undergoing radiation therapy (XRT). He presents with chronic nausea and vomiting related to his gastrostomy tube (g-tube), as well as a newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism (PE) and fevers.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure within normal range, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of a PE.

The physical examination reveals a pleasant and in pain patient with difficulty talking due to oropharynx secretions. There are no significant findings in the HEENT, cardiac, or abdominal examinations. The patient has mild diffuse rhonchi in the left lower lobe (LLL) with trace tracheal deviation to the left. No edema or calf pain is noted in the extremities. The neurologic examination is grossly intact with preserved sensation, 5/5 strength, and normal coordination. The patient is pleasant and listens appropriately.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.8 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin at 10.6 g/dL, normal glucose level, and slightly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, who has recently completed chemotherapy and is undergoing radiation therapy (XRT). He presents with chronic nausea/vomiting related to his feeding tube (g-tube), as well as a newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism (PE) and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PE: The patient has been diagnosed with a PE, which is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by a blood clot in the lungs. The patient is currently receiving heparin therapy to prevent further clotting, and long-term anticoagulation options such as Coumadin or Lovenox will be discussed with the oncologist. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed to evaluate for right ventricular strain, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels will be checked to assess volume status.
2. Fevers: The patient's fevers are potentially related to the PE, but other alternative diagnoses, such as pneumonia (PNA), should also be considered given the findings on the chest X-ray and CT scan. Although the patient is not neutropenic, he is immunosuppressed from chemotherapy and malignancy. Therefore, it is decided to continue antibiotic therapy with Levaquin for an 8-day course, while monitoring for any improvement in fevers and white blood cell count. Vancomycin and cefepime will be discontinued.
3. N/V: The patient's chronic nausea/vomiting is likely related to the g-tube. An appointment with radiology has been scheduled to advance the tube, and a nutrition consult will be obtained. Pain control with hydromorphone (Dilaudid) will be continued as needed.
4. SCC: The patient's SCC has been treated with chemotherapy and is currently undergoing radiation therapy. A hematology/oncology consult will be obtained in the morning to discuss further treatment options.
5. ICU Care: The patient's ICU care includes holding PEG tube feeds until the tube is advanced, managing glycemic control, line care, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. Bowel regimen and pain control will be addressed, and the patient's code status remains as full code. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity

   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic root
   is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Final CTA read:
   1. Multiple segmental and subsegmental PEs, as described above. There
   is
   also a larger lobar pulmonary embolus in the left lower lobar pulmonary
   artery.
   2. Scattered ground-glass nodular consolidations throughout the basilar
   part
   of the left lower lobe, most likely associated with abnormal perfusion
   given
   the presence of a large essentially occlusive pulmonary embolism
   serving this
   area. Less likely considerations are an additional inflammatory or
   infectious
   process. Chest CT surveillance is suggest in three months to show

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, who recently completed chemotherapy and is currently undergoing radiation therapy (XRT). He presents with chronic nausea/vomiting related to his gastrostomy tube (g-tube) as well as newly diagnosed pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient is currently on a heparin drip for anticoagulation and is being discussed for long-term anticoagulation options with the oncologist.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PE: The patient has documented PEs by computed tomography angiography (CTA). The left lower lobe ground glass changes are likely related to infarction given the large PE in that segment. The patient is on heparin, which is an appropriate treatment for PE. Long-term anticoagulation options should be discussed with the oncologist.
2. Fevers: The patient has had fevers that are potentially related to PE with infarct. However, he has been afebrile in the past 24 hours. The left lower lobe changes may be consistent with infarct, although infection cannot be completely ruled out. Consider discontinuing levaquin given the final CTA read, absence of leukocytosis, or fevers.
3. N/V: The patient had an appointment with radiology on Thursday to advance the tube. Appreciate GI recs. An angiographic J-t"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, who recently completed chemotherapy and is undergoing radiation therapy (XRT). He presents with chronic nausea/vomiting related to his feeding tube (g-tube), as well as newly diagnosed pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient is currently on a heparin drip for anticoagulation and requires further discussion regarding long-term anticoagulation with the oncologist.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PE: The patient has been diagnosed with multiple segmental and subsegmental PEs, along with a larger lobar pulmonary embolus in the left lower lobar pulmonary artery. This can lead to decreased oxygenation, respiratory distress, and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Infarction: The ground glass changes in the basilar part of the left lower lobe are likely due to infarction caused by the large PE in that segment. This can result in decreased lung function, impaired gas exchange, and potential secondary infection.
3. Renal lesions: The small hypodense renal lesions, most likely cysts, need further evaluation with ultrasound to confirm their nature. These lesions could potentially indicate underlying renal pathology or be benign findings.
4. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's chronic nausea/vomiting related to the g-tube should be managed appropriately to prevent aspiration and ensure proper nutrition."
