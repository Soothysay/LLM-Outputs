   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo male with h/o ETOH abuse now presents s/p witness seizure at home
   found to have ? right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and
   anemia with previous HCT baseline 30-33
   # Seizure: unclear etiology; could have likely been in the setting of
   an ICH since according to wife, the seizure occured after the first
   witnessed fall with head trauma.  Other possibilities include DTs
   though ETOH level 11 on admit. Metabolic disturbances such as
   hypoglycemia. h/o PE with LOC.  No specific neurological deficits on
   limited exam
   - NSURG/Neuro consults
   - dilantin load 1gm IV x 1 and then 100 mg TID; check level in AM
   - repeat non-contrast head CT in 12H to eval for interval change and
   r/o mass
   - infectious workup- blood cx, UA/urine cx
   - unlikely this is PE given good oxygenation; though patient does have
   sinus tachycardia
   - maintain SBP<140
   # Metabolic Alkalosis: pH 7.54 on ABG, pCO2 is 44, and HCO3 is 37.
   Unclear whether this is from GI losses given poor nutrition, renal
   losses
   - recheck lytes
   - NS bolus
   - D5NS x 1L at 100 cc/hr
   - check urine lytes
   #. Trauma- s/p fall.  CT head with right orbital fracture; no C-spine
   fractures noted on prelim read
   - consider trauma consult- isolated head injury so may not need full
   trauma consult; recheck HCT
   - plastics consult
   - c-collar in place; continue until cleared
   - f/u final CT read; logroll precautions for now; c-spine not cleared
   until final read
   #. Anemia: previous HCT 30-33, now currently 26.7.  MCV 91.  Guaiac
   negative in ED.  Has h/o portal grastropathy per record. FAST negative
   in ED.  no need for EGD at this time
   - guaiac all stools
   - check iron studies, B12, folate
   - recheck HCT on admit and in AM to assess for bleed
   #. Resp: Currently intubated on AC with good O2 sats.
   -          decrease FiO2 as tolerated; on 5 PEEP currently
   -          wean propofol to off
   -          RSBI with SBP; potentially can extubate in AM if able to
   respond to commands.  Try pressure support in AM
   # ETOH abuse: significant ETOH use.  unclear when last drink was. ETOH
   on admit 11.
   - ativan CIWA protocol once propofol weaned
   # FEN: NPO for now; nutrition consult for tube feeds
   # PPx: pneumoboots, famotidine IV

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with a witnessed seizure at home. He was found to have a right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia with a previous hematocrit (HCT) baseline of 30-33. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Seizure: The patient had a witnessed seizure, which could be due to an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) since it occurred after a fall with head trauma. Other possible causes include delirium tremens (DTs), hypoglycemia, or other metabolic disturbances.

2. Trauma: The patient has sustained trauma from a fall, resulting in a right orbital fracture and a right humeral head fracture. There are no cervical spine fractures noted on the preliminary read. Neurosurgical consultation is recommended for further evaluation and management.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis with a pH of 7.54 on ABG, pCO2 of 44, and HCO3 of 37. It is unclear whether this is due to GI losses, poor nutrition, or renal losses. Rechecking electrolytes and HCO3 levels is advised.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with a witnessed seizure at home. He has sustained a right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia with a previous hematocrit baseline of 30-33. The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient experienced a witnessed seizure, and there may be an underlying cause such as intracranial hemorrhage or other metabolic disturbances. Continuous monitoring and seizure prophylaxis should be considered.

2. Brain injury: The CT scan revealed a right superior minimally displaced orbital fracture and adjacent right basal frontal parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion with surrounding edema. This indicates a brain injury that may require further evaluation and management, including neurosurgical consultation.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off sedation and extubation should be carefully planned based on the patient's neurological status and respiratory support requirements.

4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an elevated blood pH, pCO2, and HCO3 levels, indicating metabolic alkalosis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, and appropriate treatment should be initiated to correct the imbalance.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased from 30-33 to 26.7, suggesting anemia. Evaluation of iron studies, B12, folate levels, and ongoing monitoring of hematocrit is necessary to identify the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.

6. Trauma: The patient had a fall leading to an orbital fracture. C-spine fractures have been ruled out on preliminary read, but further evaluation and consultation with trauma specialists may be required.

7. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of significant ETOH use, and the last drink's time is unclear. Monitoring for signs of ethanol withdrawal and implementing appropriate management, such as the CIWA protocol, may be necessary.

8. Pressure ulcers: Pneumoboots and famotidine IV have been ordered for pressure ulcer prophylaxis. Regular repositioning and skin assessment are important to prevent the development of pressure ulcers.

9. Infection prevention: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections. Appropriate measures such as hand hygiene, proper use of lines and catheters, and regular monitoring for infections should be implemented.

10. Code status and disposition: The patient's code status is full code, indicating that resuscitative measures should be taken if the patient's heart stops or if he experiences cardiac arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing care, but further discussions regarding disposition will be necessary based on his progress.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and comprehensive care in the ICU setting to manage the patient's various medical issues."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital after experiencing a seizure at home. He was found to have a right frontal contusion, metabolic alkalosis, and anemia with a previous hematocrit baseline of 30-33. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and sedated with propofol. He was later extubated without difficulty.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, which could be due to various causes such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), delirium tremens (DTs), or hypoglycemia. It is important to continue monitoring for any further seizures and assess the underlying cause.
2. Trauma: The patient sustained a fall resulting in a right orbital fracture and possible c-spine fractures. Neurosurgical consultation is recommended to evaluate and manage these injuries.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis with a pH of 7.54 on ABG, pCO2 of 44, and HCO3 of 37. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, which could be from GI losses, renal losses, or other factors.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased from 30-33 to 23.5, indicating anemia. Additional investigations are required to identify the cause, including iron studies, B12"

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse. He presented with a witnessed seizure at home and was found to have a right frontal contusion. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, anemia with a previous hematocrit (HCT) baseline of 30-33, and portal gastropathy. He experienced a fall and had a CT scan showing a right orbital fracture but no cervical spine fractures. The patient's mental status remains abnormal, and he is confused. He was intubated initially but was successfully extubated without difficulty after tolerating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently being treated for withdrawal symptoms.
