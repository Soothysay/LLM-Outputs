","Summary:
The patient is a well-known case of chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy, experiencing hypoxemia and obtundation overnight. The patient has mucous plugging, as evidenced by a chest X-ray. After suctioning tenacious secretions and administering Narcan, the patient showed an increase in mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is more alert and interactive on the ventilator this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a potential risk of tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
2. Mucous plugging: The presence of mucous plugging can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential development of pneumonia.
3. Sedation: The patient's sedation can contribute to hypoventilation and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: Given the patient's obesity and chronic respiratory failure, there is a possibility of this underlying condition exacerbating the hypoventilation.
5. Chronic CO2 retention: The patient may be a chronic CO2 retainer, which could worsen hypercapnic failure if not managed appropriately.
6. Stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown: The presence of a skin breakdown, potentially due to prolonged immobility or pressure, increases the risk of infection and impaired healing.
7. Wound infection: The patient has a wound infection that requires appropriate antibiotic therapy.
8. AFib (atrial fibrillation): The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a well-known case of chronic respiratory failure with a tracheostomy in place. The patient experienced worsening hypoventilatory failure overnight, along with hypoxemia and obtundation. A chest X-ray revealed mucous plugging, which was suctioned and Narcan was given, leading to an increase in mental status. 

The patient's allergies include penicillins and sulfa medications. They have been receiving various medications such as midodrine, Epogen, Lansoprazole, Meropenem, simvastatin, lidocain patch, RISS, Colace, fentanyl, and oxycodone.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/53 mmHg to 56/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance indicate a total intake of 150 mL since 12 AM, with no output recorded. The respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O, compliance of 31.3 cmH2O/mL, and an FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with diminished breath sounds at the right base. The patient is overweight and obese, with soft and bowel sounds present. Neurologically, the patient is sedated and minimally responsive.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hematocrit of 25.4%, platelet count of 187 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 86 mg/dL, and sodium/potassium levels within normal range. The patient's most recent imaging shows bilateral effusions, increased edema, and possible right lower lobe infiltrate.

The assessment and plan include worsening hypoventilatory failure related to somnolence and hypoxemia, possibly due to mucous plugging. The patient is to continue non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) at night, and a formal polysomnogram is planned. The patient may be a chronic CO2 retainer, so over-correction of O2 saturation may suppress the drive to breathe and worsen hypercapnic failure. Pulmonary toilet is also recommended.

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), stable and continuing with medications and three times weekly HD. The patient's chronic hypertension is stable on midodrine. Pain control is managed through palliative care services, favoring short-acting analgesia given the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient has a complicated hospital course and is now being transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient has several medical conditions and potential complications that need to be addressed:

1. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which requires ongoing wound care. There was a plan for colostomy to continuously divert fecal matter away from the wound, but the patient and family declined initially. However, they agreed to consider the procedure after further discussion. An ethics consult has been called due to concerns about the patient's wishes regarding the colostomy.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, as indicated by a pH of 7.07 and pCO2 of 116 on arterial blood gas analysis. This could be due to mucous plugging and/or volume overload. The patient is currently on tracheostomy mask support.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level increased to 148 this morning. The patient was only receiving 50 cc of free water every 8 hours with tube feeds. The plan is to increase the free water flush"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now is transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - Plastic surgery and ID following.
   Continuously contaminated with fecal matter and plan was for colostomy
   until pt and family declined.  The recommedation for a colostomy was
   again addressed yesterday during a family meeting and the family agreed
   to consider the procedure.  Due to some concern about the patient
   wishes regarding the colostomy, an ethics consult was recalled and will
   examine the situation.
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem.
   - Pain control with lidocaine patches, fentanyl patch; minimize
   narcotic use.
   - The surgery team was consulted yesterday to evaluate him for
   diverting colostomy.  He had been previously evaluated, but at the time
   the family did not want to proceed with the operation.  Will have them
   reevaluate and will meeting with the family as a group to discuss the
   surgery.  Appreciate consult and will f/u recs.
   - Appreciate ethics consult, will f/u recs.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. ABG was
   significant for a pH of 7.07 and pCO2 of 116. Most likely inciting
   event was mucous plugging +/- volume overload.  He is not back on his
   trach mask satting in the high 90
   - Continue trach mask support.
   # Hypernatremia:  The patient
s Na increased to 148 this am from 146.
   He was only getting 50 cc of free water q8h with his tube feeds.
   - Will increase the free water flushes to 150 cc q4h and recheck his Na
   in the evening.
   # Supratherapeutic INR: The patient is on coumadin for a.fib, however
   this has been held because he is supratherapeutic.  INR today was 6.6.
   - Will given 10 mg IV Vit K x 1 for correction of his INR.  Once <2,
   will start a heparin gtt in anticipation of surgery.
   # Hypotension: Stable; pt's SBPs have run in 80s systolic through this
   prolonged hospital course.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anemia - Most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT stable. Will transfuse for goal
   HCT > 21. Getting epo at HD.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   # Type II DM: Continue ISS and Lantus.
   # R BKA/PVD:
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   # FEN: continue TF with increase in free water as above, replete lytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia episodes. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, type II diabetes mellitus, right below-knee amputation with peripheral vascular disease, plasma cell dyscrasia, and femoral nerve entrapment. The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require management, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, stage IV coccygeal ulcer, end-stage renal disease, anemia, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type II diabetes mellitus, right below-knee amputation with peripheral vascular disease, plasma cell dyscrasia, and femoral nerve entrapment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, and potential development of respiratory arrest if ventilatory support is not provided adequately.

2. Hypotension: The patient may continue to have low blood pressure, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential shock if not managed appropriately.

3. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient is at risk of ongoing infection and potential spread of infection to other areas"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with chronic respiratory failure. They are experiencing worsened hypoventilatory failure due to somnolence and hypoxemia, possibly related to mucus plugging. The patient is a chronic CO2 retainer and may have obesity hypoventilation syndrome. They are being supported with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) at night and will undergo a formal polysomnogram at some point.

The patient also has stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown and requires a diverting colostomy to aid in wound healing. They are being treated with wound care and meropenem through [1-11] for wound infection.

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, which is stable with continued medication and treatment on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. They are also being treated for chronic hypertension, controlled on midodrine, and atrial fibrillation, rate-controlled on coumadin.

The patient is experiencing hypernatremia, with a free water deficit that will require increased free water flushes and follow-up ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening hypoventilatory failure due to mucus plugging.
2. Development of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
3. Non-healing of the stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now is transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - Plastic surgery and ID following.
   Continuously contaminated with fecal matter and plan was for colostomy
   until pt and family declined.  The recommedation for a colostomy was
   again addressed during a family meeting and the family agreed to
   consider the procedure.  An ethical consult was obtained as previously
   mentioned, surgery will either see him today or tomorrow AM to discuss
   the surgery.
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem.
   - Pain control with lidocaine patches. Will start fentanyl patch; will
   caution increasing Oxycodone given his history hypercapneic respiratory
   failure [**1-18**] narcotic use.
   - Surgery will see him today or tomorrow to discuss the procedure with
   him.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. ABG was
   significant for a pH of 7.07 and pCO2 of 116. Most likely inciting
   event was mucous plugging +/- volume overload.  He is not back on his
   trach mask satting in the high 90
   - Continue trach mask support.
   - BiPAP at night
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure
   # Supratherapeutic INR: The patient is on coumadin for a.fib, however
   this has been held because he is supratherapeutic.  INR today was 1.6.
   -          Pt received 10 mg IV Vit K last night
   -          Will keep pt on Heparin gtt as he is likely to undergo
   surgery. Will restart Coumadin after surgery.
   # Hypotension: Stable; pt's SBPs have run in 80s systolic through this
   prolonged hospital course.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anemia - Most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT stable. Will transfuse for goal
   HCT > 21. Getting epo at HD.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.
   -          Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   -          Pt currently off of Coumadin in anticipation of OR, will
   continue on Heparin gtt
   # Type II DM:  Pt noted to have a low glc on PM labs yesterday, unclear
   as to why as his TF were not stopped. Will likely decrease his Lantus
   today and continue to monitor his CBGs.
   # R BKA/PVD:
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   # FEN: continue TF with increase in free water as above, replete lytes

The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient has a history of mucous plugging and volume overload, which likely contributed to his current condition. He is currently on tracheostomy mask support and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) at night. Narcotic use should be cautious due to the risk of hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, so vitamin K was administered, and he will be restarted on Coumadin after surgery. He also has hypotension, for which midodrine is being continued. 

The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis (HD). His HD line shows surrounding erythema, but it has been stable without any signs of infection. Anemia management is ongoing, and he is receiving erythropoietin (epo) during HD.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a TTE showing a dilated left ventricular cavity. There are no signs of active cardiac ischemia, and he is currently not on beta-blockers or Cou"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now is transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - Plastic surgery and ID following.
   Continuously contaminated with fecal matter and plan was for colostomy
   until pt and family declined.  The recommedation for a colostomy was
   again addressed yesterday during a family meeting and the family agreed
   to consider the procedure.  Due to some concern about the patient
   wishes regarding the colostomy, an ethics consult was recalled and will
   examine the situation.
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem.
   - Pain control with lidocaine patches, fentanyl patch; minimize
   narcotic use.
   - The surgery team was consulted yesterday to evaluate him for
   diverting colostomy.  He had been previously evaluated, but at the time
   the family did not want to proceed with the operation.  Will have them
   reevaluate and will meeting with the family as a group to discuss the
   surgery.  Appreciate consult and will f/u recs.
   - Appreciate ethics consult, will f/u recs.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. ABG was
   significant for a pH of 7.07 and pCO2 of 116. Most likely inciting
   event was mucous plugging +/- volume overload.  He is not back on his
   trach mask satting in the high 90
   - Continue trach mask support.
   # Hypernatremia:  The patient
s Na increased to 148 this am from 146.
   He was only getting 50 cc of free water q8h with his tube feeds.
   - Will increase the free water flushes to 150 cc q4h and recheck his Na
   in the evening.
   # Supratherapeutic INR: The patient is on coumadin for a.fib, however
   this has been held because he is supratherapeutic.  INR today was 6.6.
   - Will given 10 mg IV Vit K x 1 for correction of his INR.  Once <2,
   will start a heparin gtt in anticipation of surgery.
   # Hypotension: Stable; pt's SBPs have run in 80s systolic through this
   prolonged hospital course.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anemia - Most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT stable. Will transfuse for goal
   HCT > 21. Getting epo at HD.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   # Type II DM: Continue ISS and Lantus.
   # R BKA/PVD:
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple medical problems including chronic respiratory failure, stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, and pain control. He is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's chronic respiratory failure is hypoventilatory failure related to somnolence and hypoxemia, possibly exacerbated by mucus plugging. The plan is to continue non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) at night, consider a formal polysomnogram, and avoid over-correction of oxygen saturation as it may suppress the drive to breathe.

The patient has stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown, and a diverting colostomy has been suggested by [Doctor First Name] to aid in healing. The wound care will be continued, and a discussion with the family regarding this option will be pursued. The patient is also on meropenem through [1-11] for wound infection.

The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is stable on hemodialysis, and the medications and dialysis schedule will be continued. Chronic hypotension is stable on midodrine.

For pain control, the patient is under palliative care services and prefers short-acting analgesia due to the propensity for respiratory failure. NIPPV may help protect against hypoventilation associated with sedation, and the use of a fentanyl patch with slow dose titration is allowed."

","Summary:
The patient is an overweight/obese individual with chronic respiratory failure, stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, pain control, and atrial fibrillation. They have been on mechanical ventilation and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 51-140 mg/dL. There is evidence of a possible wound infection, and the patient has been on meropenem through 1/11. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) has been subtherapeutic, and they are back on heparin due to atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and propensity for hypoventilation increase the risk of further respiratory failure, especially if sedation suppresses their drive to breathe.
2. Wound infection: The presence of a wound infection indicated by positive cultures for Pseudomonas and the patient's being on meropenem suggest the possibility of worsening infection.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood glucose levels indicate the potential for hypoglycemia, which can be dangerous if not managed properly.
4. Bleeding risk: The subtherapeutic INR and temporary discontinuation of warfarin due to atrial fibrillation increase the risk of bleeding events, especially considering the patient is on systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophyl"

   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - Plastic surgery and ID following.
   Continuously contaminated with fecal matter and plan was for colostomy
   until pt and family declined.  The recommedation for a colostomy was
   again addressed during a family meeting and the family agreed to
   consider the procedure.  An ethical consult was obtained as previously
   mentioned, surgery will either see him today or tomorrow AM to discuss
   the surgery.
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem.
   - Pain control with lidocaine patches. Will start fentanyl patch; will
   caution increasing Oxycodone given his history hypercapneic respiratory
   failure [**1-18**] narcotic use.
   - Surgery will see him today or tomorrow to discuss the procedure with
   him.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. ABG was
   significant for a pH of 7.07 and pCO2 of 116. Most likely inciting
   event was mucous plugging +/- volume overload.  He is not back on his
   trach mask satting in the high 90
   - Continue trach mask support.
   - BiPAP at night
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure
   # Supratherapeutic INR: The patient is on coumadin for a.fib, however
   this has been held because he is supratherapeutic.  INR today was 1.6.
   -          Pt received 10 mg IV Vit K last night
   -          Will keep pt on Heparin gtt as he is likely to undergo
   surgery. Will restart Coumadin after surgery.
   # Hypotension: Stable; pt's SBPs have run in 80s systolic through this
   prolonged hospital course.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anemia - Most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT stable. Will transfuse for goal
   HCT > 21. Getting epo at HD.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.
   -          Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   -          Pt currently off of Coumadin in anticipation of OR, will
   continue on Heparin gtt
   # Type II DM:  Pt noted to have a low glc on PM labs yesterday, unclear

He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/48 mmHg to 113/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the tracheostomy tube. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has several medical complications, including renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently on various medications, including heparin, meropenem, fentanyl, lansoprazole, and midodrine.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing wound care, broad-spectrum antibiotics, pain control, and tracheostomy mask support. The patient will also undergo a surgical procedure to address his stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and an ethical consult has been obtained.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic respiratory failure, and an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer. He has a history of multiple ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels in the 70s indicate severe respiratory compromise. Continuous tracheostomy mask support and BiPAP at night should be continued to assist with ventilation.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated due to Coumadin use for atrial fibrillation. However, Coumadin has been held, and the patient has been started on heparin gtt. Heparin gtt should be continued as the patient is likely to undergo surgery soon. Coumadin can be restarted after surgery.
3. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressures have been running in the 80s. Midodrine should continue to be administered to maintain stable blood pressure levels.
4. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to diabetic nephropathy. The HD line site should be monitored for any signs of infection or complications. Renal function tests should also be"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now is transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - Plastic surgery and ID following.
   Continuously contaminated with fecal matter and plan was for colostomy
   until pt and family declined.  The recommedation for a colostomy was
   again addressed during a family meeting and the family agreed to
   consider the procedure.  Surgery evaluated him and agreed to do the
   surgery and have added him on the schedule for Wednesday.
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem.
   - Pain control with fentanyl patchs; will caution increasing Oxycodone
   given his history hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use.
   - Surgery planned for Wenesday.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support.
   - BiPAP at night
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.
   # Hypotension: Stable; pt's SBPs have run in 80s systolic through this
   prolonged hospital course.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anemia - Most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT stable. Will transfuse for goal
   HCT > 21. Getting epo at HD.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Pt currently off of Coumadin in anticipation of OR, will continue on
   Heparin gtt
   # Type II DM:
   - Continue lanuts and SSI with qid fingersticks.
   # R BKA/PVD:
   - Continue current wound care

","The patient is an elderly, obese male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes a recommendation for colostomy, which was initially declined but later agreed upon after a family meeting. Surgery has evaluated the patient and agreed to perform the procedure, with plans to schedule it for Wednesday.

The patient's current medications include meropenem for broad-spectrum antibiotics, fentanyl patches for pain control, and caution against increasing Oxycodone due to his history of hypercapnic respiratory failure. He is also on a tracheostomy mask during the day and BiPAP at night for respiratory support. The patient's blood pressure is stable in the 80s systolic, and he is continuing midodrine. He is on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease caused by diabetic nephropathy. His hemoglobin concentration is low, most likely due to ESRD, and he will be transfused for a goal hemoglobin concentration of >21. He is also receiving epo at hemodialysis.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with a TTE showing an ejection fraction of 50-55% and a dilated LV cavity. No signs of active cardiac ischemia are"

   again addressed during a family meeting and the family agreed to
   consider the procedure.  An ethical consult was obtained as previously
   mentioned, surgery will either see him today or tomorrow AM to discuss
   the surgery.
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem.
   - Pain control with fentanyl patchs; will caution increasing Oxycodone
   given his history hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use.
   - Surgery will see meet with family to discuss diverting colostomy
   today AM.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night
   - Continue trach mask support.
   - BiPAP at night
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic

   # Supratherapeutic INR: The patient is on coumadin for a.fib, however
   this has been held because he is going to the OR for diverting
   colostomy. Pt was started on Heparin gtt instead.
   -          Will keep pt on Heparin gtt as he is likely to undergo
   surgery. Will restart Coumadin after surgery.
   # Hypotension: Stable; pt's SBPs have run in 80s systolic through this
   prolonged hospital course.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 99/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 90, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, and spontaneous tidal volume of 376-578 mL. The patient is also receiving heparin sodium infusion, fentanyl patch, and lorazepam. Physical examination reveals course bronchial sounds in the upper airway, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and edema in the right leg and foot. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now is transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - Plastic surgery and ID following.
   Continuously contaminated with fecal matter and plan was for colostomy
   until pt and family declined.  The recommedation for a colostomy was
   again addressed during a family meeting and the family agreed to
   consider the procedure.  Surgery evaluated him and agreed to do the
   surgery and have added him on the schedule for Wednesday.
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem.
   - Pain control with fentanyl patchs; will caution increasing Oxycodone
   given his history hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use.
   - Surgery planned for Wenesday.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support.
   - BiPAP at night
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.
   # Hypotension: Stable; pt's SBPs have run in 80s systolic through this
   prolonged hospital course.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anemia - Most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT stable. Will transfuse for goal
   HCT > 21. Getting epo at HD.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Pt currently off of Coumadin in anticipation of OR, will continue on
   Heparin gtt
   # Type II DM:
   - Continue lanuts and SSI with qid fingersticks.
   # R BKA/PVD:
   - Continue current wound care

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Appreciate Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3336**]
s input regarding diverting colostomy which is
   tentatively scheduled for next week. He continues to need IV fentanyl
   for dressing changes to his wound.
   Exam notable for obese [**Male First Name (un) **] in mild respiratory distress. Tm of 98.9 BP
   99/52 HR of 94 RR of 24 with sats of 95% on 50% FiO2.  he has
   expiratory wheezing to exam and anasarca with malodorous discharge from
   sacral wound. Labs notable for WBC 11.1 K, HCT of 26.2 , K+ of 5.3 ,
   Cr  of 2.1. No new culture data ( on Meropenem and ? Daptomycin).
   Agree with plan to support with Iv Antibiotics and dressing changes
   until surgery completed. He is frail form both respiratory and
   hemodynamic standpoints for surgery but that may be the only option for
   allowing his wound to heal. He and his family have discussed this with
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3336**]. We will tarnsfur to Hct of 27 in anticipation of surgical
   procdure next week. Plans for HD in am [**2151-1-3**] noted.

The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been recommended for a colostomy to continuously divert fecal matter from his infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer. The family initially declined the recommendation, but after further discussion, they agreed to consider the procedure. Surgery evaluated the patient and agreed to perform the surgery, with a scheduled date of Wednesday. The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, anemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), type II diabetes mellitus, right below-knee amputation/prosthetic vascular disease (R BKA/PVD), plasma cell dyscrasia, and familial enteropathy (FEN). He is on multiple medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics, pain control with fentanyl patches, and midodrine for hypotension. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, potassium levels, creatinine, and glucose. He has ongoing wound care, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and requires close monitoring of his hemodynamic status, renal function, and glycemic control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease, type II diabetes mellitus, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient has been added for surgery on Wednesday. He has allergies to penicillins and sulfa (sulfonamides), and received a last dose of antibiotics, meropenem, at 08:00 PM on 01/02/2151. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion, lansoprazole (Prevacid), and fentanyl. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/48 to 110/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool tracheostomy mask. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Surgical complications: As the patient is scheduled for surgery, there is a risk of surgical site infections, bleeding, or anesthetic complications.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic respiratory failure increases the risk of pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or worsening respiratory status during or after surgery.
3. Renal complications: With end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the patient is at risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) episodes. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer and has declined colostomy initially but agreed to consider the procedure after another family meeting. He is scheduled for surgery on Wednesday.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, leading to elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood.
2. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient has a severe wound infection in the coccygeal area that requires surgical intervention and may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's kidneys are severely damaged, resulting in inadequate kidney function. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and increased risk of infections.
4. Type II diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of infections and pressure ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current medications include meropenem for infection, fentanyl patches for pain control, and lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. He is also on midodrine for hypotension and will undergo hemodialysis tomorrow.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which is being managed by plastic surgery and infectious disease. He has agreed to undergo a colostomy surgery scheduled for Wednesday. He also has chronic anemia likely due to ESRD and is being treated with erythropoietin during hemodialysis. His atrial fibrillation is currently well-controlled, and he is on heparin infusion.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels, with low platelet count. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and hypercarbic respiratory failure pose a significant risk of further respiratory compromise."

   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support.
   - BiPAP at night
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 6547**] has needed IV fentanyl for dressing changes but no escalation
   in basal dose. He awaits surgery next week for diverting colostomy.
   Exam notable for obese [**Male First Name (un) **] on trach collar Tm of 99.5 BP of 105/65 HR of
   83 RR of 24 with sats of 95% . He does have expiratory wheeze to exam
   in all lung fields..
   Labs notable for WBC  14.1K, HCT of 25.5  ,Cr of 2.2 , lactate.
   Agree with plan to continue supportive care, dressing changes and as
   needed ventilatory assist. He will need HD in next 24 hrs
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable but ill requiring ICu level nursing care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient has a complicated hospital course with previous ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated infections. He has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, for which plastic surgery and infectious disease consultations have been obtained. The patient and his family declined the initial recommendation for a colostomy; however, after further discussion, they agreed to consider the procedure. Surgery evaluated him and scheduled the surgery for Wednesday.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 100/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool tracheostomy mask with BiPAP at night. His physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds anteriorly, clear tracheal tube, and bilateral upper extremity edema. Neurologically, he is attentive and follows commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.5%, creatinine (Cr) of 2.2 mg/dL, and elevated troponin"

The patient has been transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on BiPAP support at night. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels in the 70s and thick secretions indicate respiratory distress. The patient is currently on BiPAP support, but close monitoring of respiratory function is essential.

2. Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer. Surgical intervention is imperative due to the severity of the ulcer. If the patient and family decide not to proceed with surgery, the patient will be on comfort measures only.

3. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) has been running in the 80s throughout the hospital course. The patient is on midodrine, and close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.

4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to diabetic nephropathy. The HD"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now is transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - Plastic surgery and ID following.
   Continuously contaminated with fecal matter and plan was for colostomy
   until pt and family declined.  The recommedation for a colostomy was
   again addressed during a family meeting and the family agreed to
   consider the procedure.  Surgery evaluated him and agreed to do the
   surgery and have added him on the schedule for Wednesday. Family though
   is still in discussion whether they still want the surgery, will get
   back either today or tomorrow.
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem
   - Pain control with fentanyl patchs; will caution increasing Oxycodone
   given his history hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use.
   - Will need to touch base with family regarding the surgery, pt is
   tentatively scheduled for Wenesday
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support.
   - BiPAP at night
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.
   # Hyperkalemia: Pt
s K+ elevated this AM, pt did not receive HD
   yesterday will get it today.
   # Hypotension: Stable; pt's SBPs have run in 80s systolic through this
   prolonged hospital course.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - HD Monday
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anemia - Most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT stable. Will transfuse for goal
   HCT > 21. Getting epo at HD.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Pt currently off of Coumadin in anticipation of OR, will continue on
   Heparin gtt
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - continue meropenem, ID following peripherally
   # Type II DM:
   - Continue lanuts and SSI with qid fingersticks.
   # R BKA/PVD:
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure, stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, pain management, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, normal heart rate, and slightly elevated respiratory rate. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's medical history includes obesity, unknown allergies, and previous use of antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and obesity hypoventilation syndrome put them at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Wound Infection: The stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown increases the risk of wound infection, which may require surgical intervention like a diverting colostomy.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis indicates impaired kidney function. There is a risk of worsening renal failure or fluid overload due to inadequate fluid management.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be monitored closely, and anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent thromboembolic events.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a morbidly obese male with chronic respiratory failure, stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation, and pain control issues. The patient is currently on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) at night and has a tracheostomy tube in place. He has been receiving meropenem for a suspected wound infection. The patient's blood sugar levels have been well-controlled, and he is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The family has been informed about the planned surgical intervention for tomorrow, and the patient's code status remains as full code. He will be staying in the ICU today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoventilation and respiratory failure: The patient's obesity hypoventilation syndrome increases the risk of hypoventilation, especially during periods of sedation or when using the fentanyl patch.
2. Wound infection: The patient is receiving meropenem for a suspected wound infection. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance.
3. Skin breakdown: The stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown requires proper wound care and may require a diverting colostomy to aid in healing.
4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's ESRD is being managed with hemodialysis. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He has been transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition includes hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, altered mental status, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient's family has agreed to surgery for Wednesday, and he has been prepped with golytely. His tube feeds were stopped at midnight, and heparin gtt will be stopped at 5 am. Labs, type & screen/cross match, CXR, EKG were ordered for tomorrow, along with a tap water enema in the morning if not cleared. The patient had two low blood sugars overnight after his tube feeds were stopped, so a D5W infusion was started. His fentanyl boluses were increased due to persistent pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now is transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer Family meeting was held yesterday and pt
   decided on diverting colostomy. Pt was prepped last night and is
   scheduled for surgery today. Heparin gtt has been held. Diverting
   colostomy is vital given his large decub that currently fails to heal
   [**1-18**] continual exposure to fecal material.
   - Pt underwent surgery yesterday
   - Heparin gtt and tube feeds started this AM per Surgery recs
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem
   - Pain control with fentanyl patchs; will caution Oxycodone given his
   history hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support.
   - BiPAP at night
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.
   # Hypotension: Stable; pt's SBPs have run in 80s systolic through this
   prolonged hospital course, post op though due to decreased SBP in the
   60s needed pressor support. Pt
s pre-op SBP was 80s with pt taking
   Midodrine, will wean pressors with a goal of SBP >80 if mentating well.
   - continue midodrine
   - will wean pressors for a goal SBP >80
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   # Anemia
 Pt has underlying anemia most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT
   stable. Getting epo at HD. Post-op Hct noted to be several points below
   pre-op Hct, EBL reported as minimal per OR report. Hct of 31 most
   likely hemoconcentrated as pt has not had a Hct that high before. Will
   obtain repeat Hct.
   - Repeat Hct, surgery aware of Hct drop
   - Transfuse for goal >21
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Pt currently off of Coumadin in anticipation of OR, will continue on
   Heparin gtt
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - continue meropenem, ID following peripherally
   # Type II DM:
   - Continue lanuts and SSI with qid fingersticks.
   # R BKA/PVD:
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) episodes.

The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent surgery to create a diverting colostomy due to a stage IV coccygeal ulcer. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of type II DM and is at risk for hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels are closely monitored and managed accordingly.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, but there are no active issues at present. The patient is currently not on nodal agents and will continue with heparin gtt.

3. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to diabetic nephropathy. The HD line shows surrounding erythema, but it has been stable with negative blood cultures. Regular monitoring of the HD line site exam is advised.

4. Anemia: The patient has underlying anemia, likely related to ESRD. He is receiving epo at HD"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM type II, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a complicated medical history, including hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic respiratory failure.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:
1. Diverting colostomy for the infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer.
2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics with meropenem.
3. Pain control with fentanyl patches, cautioning against increasing oxycodone due to his history of hypercapnic respiratory failure.
4. Tracheostomy mask support during the day and CPAP at night for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
5. Midodrine for hypotension.
6. Hemodialysis (HD) on Monday and monitoring of HD line site exam.
7. Blood transfusion for anemia with a goal HCT > 21 and getting epo at HD.
8. Statin for CAD, off beta-blocker until BPs can better tolerate.
9. No nodal agents for atrial fibrillation until BPs can better tolerate.
10. Heparin gtt for atrial fibrillation.
11. Continue meropenem"

","Summary:
The patient is a morbidly obese male with multiple comorbidities, including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown, and atrial fibrillation. The patient presented to the hospital with severe sepsis secondary to a wound infection and was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

24-hour events:
- The patient underwent a diverting colostomy yesterday and experienced transient confusion with a blood glucose level of 25.
- The patient had hypotension last night with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s, which responded to fluid resuscitation but required the initiation of phenylephrine infusion. The patient also resumed oral intake today.
- The patient complains of back pain today.

Medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except as noted above.

Physical examination:
- General appearance: The patient is not in acute distress and is described as overweight/obese.
- Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, with S2 being distant.
- Peripheral vascular: Radial pulses were not assessed, and the patient had absent right and left dorsal pedal pulses.
- Respiratory/chest: Diminished breath sounds.
- Abdominal: Soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and the patient is described as obese.
- Extremities: Right lower extremity had absent pulses, and the left lower extremity had 1+ pulses.

   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy POD # 2: Patietn had diverting colostomy on
   [**1-6**] - decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that
   was continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal
   incontinence.  Since surgery, patient has had increasing pressor
   requirement and now has an increased WBC at 22 (was 11 prior to
   surgery).  This could be pos-op leukocytosis but also concern for
   infection given pressor requirement.  Has not mounted a fever in >24
   hours.  On Meropenem for osteomyelitis which has very broad coverage
   including intra-abdominal organisms.
   - follow up surgery recs
   - ID as below
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**].
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem
   - Pain control with fentanyl patchs; will caution increasing Oxycodone
   given his history hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - CPAP at night
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.
   # Hypotension: Patient having increasing pressor requirement, now on
   1.2 of neosynepherine. There's significant difference between the
   A-line and his cuff pressures.  Given that patient has recently had
   bowel surgery, concern for infection is high.  He is currently on
   Meropenem for his osteomyelitis.  Meropenem is broad spectrum and
   covers intra-abdominal [**Last Name (LF) 5171**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] it is unclear why patient is requiring
   more pressor support.
   - continue pressor
   - will touch base with ID who has been following him intermittently
   through his hospital course to determine if additional antibiotic
   coverage is required
   - continue midodrine
   - discuss with team discrepency between A-line and cuff pressures
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.

The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was recently transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient had a diverting colostomy performed on [**1-6**] due to a stage 4 coccygeal ulcer. Since surgery, the patient has had increasing pressor requirements and an increased WBC count. He is currently on meropenem for osteomyelitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is low at 57 mg/dL, indicating a potential risk for hypoglycemia.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potentially lead to complications such as stroke.
3. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient has ESRD, which is a life-threatening condition that requires dialysis to remove waste products from the blood.
4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient has uncontrolled DM2, which increases the risk of complications such as hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which can lead to further complications if not"

   [**1-6**] - decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that
   was continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal
   incontinence.  Since surgery, patient has had increasing pressor
   requirement and now has an increased WBC at 22 (was 11 prior to
   surgery).  This is likely post-op leukocytosis.  Has not mounted a
   fever in >24 hours.  On Meropenem for osteomyelitis which has very
   broad coverage including intra-abdominal organisms.
   - follow up surgery recs
   - ostomy care
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**].
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem
   - Pain control with fentanyl [**Last Name (LF) 7634**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] increase fenatnyl patch to
   75mg.hr; will caution increasing Oxycodone given his history
   hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use
   - has been see by chronic pain service in [**Last Name (LF) 102**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] re-consult
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - BIPAP at night with higher narcotics for pain controll to allow for
   sleep
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.
   # Hypotension: Patient having increasing pressor requirement, now on
   1.2 of neosynepherine. There's significant difference between the
   A-line and his cuff pressures.  Goal bp in 80
 will follow cuff
   pressures for now as a-line with poor wave form.
   - wean pressor
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD today
   # Anemia: Most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT stable. Will transfuse for goal
   HCT > 21. Getting epo at HD. Hct this morning 25.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR 1.6 on heparin gtt and
   restarted coumadin
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Coumadin restarted yesterday with heparin bridge

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He underwent a diverting colostomy on [date] due to a stage 4 coccygeal ulcer. The patient has been experiencing increasing pressor requirement, elevated white blood cell count, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently on ventilatory support with tracheostomy and BiPAP at night. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he requires vasopressors. He also has a history of ESRD, anemia, CAD, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, type II DM, R BKA/PVD, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable and requires vasopressors. There is a significant difference between the arterial line and cuff pressures. The goal blood pressure is 80, and the current treatment plan is to wean off the pressor and continue with midodrine.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is currently on ventilatory support with tracheostomy and BiPAP at night. Narcotics have been causing his hypercarbic respiratory failure. The current plan is to continue tracheostomy support, use"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown due to a diverting colostomy. Wound care and antibiotics are being administered.

2. The patient is experiencing chronic respiratory failure, which may be related to somnolence, hypoxemia, and possible mucous plugging. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been initiated, and a formal polysomnogram will be conducted at some point.

3. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on maintenance hemodialysis (MWF HD). Fluid management and medication adjustment are ongoing.

4. Pain control is being managed through palliative care services, favoring short-acting analgesia due to the patient's propensity for respiratory failure. The use of fentanyl patches is allowed with slow dose titration.

5. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, possibly due to poor arterial line tracing. The arterial line has been discontinued, and mental status will be closely monitored.

6. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through a Fibersource HN formula at 60 mL/hour. Glycemic control is also being monitored.

7. The patient has multiple lines in place, including a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not explicitly stated. However, the note mentions several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Dusky stoma: The concern for a dusky stoma indicates possible compromised blood flow to the stoma, which may require immediate evaluation to prevent tissue damage or necrosis.

2. Unable to wean off Levophed: The inability to wean off Levophed, a vasopressor medication, suggests ongoing hypotension or inadequate organ perfusion. This could be a sign of septic shock or other causes of cardiovascular instability.

3. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoventilatory failure related to somnolence and hypoxemia, possibly exacerbated by mucus plugging. This requires intervention such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and pulmonary toilet to improve oxygenation and ventilation.

4. Stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown: The patient has developed a stage IV pressure ulcer on their coccyx. This requires aggressive wound care and consideration for antibiotic therapy due to a suspected wound infection.

5. Chronic kidney disease (ESRD): The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week and requires close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.

6. Pain control: Given the patient's propensity for respiratory failure, short-acting analgesia is favored, and the use of NIPPV can help protect against hypoventilation associated with sed"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - As his a-line BP isn't accurate, agreement was made to wean off
   levophed and monitor his mentation.  His A-line was DC'ed.  The
   levophed was weaned off overnight.
   - Chronic pain consult service recommended liberalizing his pain
   medication which could include increasing his opiods, a ketamine gtt
   (although he couldn't go to rehab with this), alcohol ablation of nerve
   roots (although he would lose feeling in other areas and be predisposed
   to further ulceration), or an epidural pump (although this is generally
   pallative since there is increasing risk for infection the longer it is
   left in).

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now is transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy POD # 2: Patietn had diverting colostomy on
   [**1-6**] - decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that
   was continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal
   incontinence.  Since surgery, patient has had increasing pressor
   requirement and now has an increased WBC at 22 (was 11 prior to
   surgery).  This is likely post-op leukocytosis.  Has not mounted a
   fever in >24 hours.  On Meropenem for osteomyelitis which has very
   broad coverage including intra-abdominal organisms.
   - follow up surgery recs
   - ostomy care
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**].
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem
   - Pain control with fentanyl [**Last Name (LF) 7634**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] increase fenatnyl patch to
   75mg.hr; will caution increasing Oxycodone given his history
   hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use
   - has been see by chronic pain service in [**Last Name (LF) 102**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] re-consult
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - BIPAP at night with higher narcotics for pain controll to allow for
   sleep
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.
   # Hypotension: Patient having increasing pressor requirement, now on
   1.2 of neosynepherine. There's significant difference between the
   A-line and his cuff pressures.  Goal bp in 80
 will follow cuff
   pressures for now as a-line with poor wave form.
   - wean pressor
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD today
   # Anemia: Most likely [**1-18**] to ESRD, HCT stable. Will transfuse for goal
   HCT > 21. Getting epo at HD. Hct this morning 25.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR 1.6 on heparin gtt and
   restarted coumadin
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Coumadin restarted yesterday with heparin bridge
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - continue meropenem
   # Type II DM:
   - Continue lanuts and SSI with qid fingersticks.
   # R BKA/PVD:
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a history of diverting colostomy surgery. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and being weaned off vasopressors. He has multiple comorbidities including anemia, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, type II diabetes, right below-knee amputation/prosthetic vascular disease, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercapnia is a result of his chronic respiratory failure and may worsen if ventilatory support is inadequate or if narcotics are not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of further infection due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Hypotension: The patient's increasing pressor requirement indicates possible persistent hypotension, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent organ damage.
4. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable but low. Transfusion may be necessary to maintain an adequate level of hemoglobin.

   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - BIPAP at night with higher narcotics for pain controll to allow for
   sleep
   - Caution narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has undergone diverting colostomy for his stage IV coccygeal ulcer and is currently on meropenem for osteomyelitis. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 90/42 mmHg and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. He is on multiple medications including fentanyl, midodrine, and epoetin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's high carbon dioxide levels indicate respiratory failure, which may require continued ventilatory support.
2. Osteomyelitis: The patient is on meropenem for osteomyelitis, and it is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
3. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis due to diabetic nephropathy. Close monitoring of the HD line site and renal function is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he requires transfusion to maintain a target hematocrit level above 21%. Epoetin will be given during"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - As his a-line BP isn't accurate, agreement was made to wean off
   levophed and monitor his mentation.  His A-line was DC'ed.  The
   levophed was weaned off overnight.
   - Chronic pain consult service recommended liberalizing his pain
   medication which could include increasing his opiods, a ketamine gtt
   (although he couldn't go to rehab with this), alcohol ablation of nerve
   roots (although he would lose feeling in other areas and be predisposed
   to further ulceration), or an epidural pump (although this is generally
   pallative since there is increasing risk for infection the longer it is
   left in).
   - His fentanyl patch was increased to 75 mcg.

","The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. The patient's arterial line stopped at 06:28 PM. The patient was more somnolent today and the line was discontinued. The patient was weaned off pressors and seen by the pain service. The patient will continue using the fentanyl patch.

2. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and sulfa (sulfonamides), with unknown reactions. The last dose of antibiotics given was meropenem on [**2151-1-9**] at 08:58 AM.

3. The patient is currently receiving several infusions, including heparin sodium at 1,350 units per hour. Other medications being administered include lansoprazole (Prevacid) at [**2151-1-8**] 08:00 PM, fentanyl at [**2151-1-8**] 09:44 PM, and others such as colace, RISS, insulin, lido patch, simvastatin, epo, meropenem, midodrine, atrovent, feso4, fentanyl patch, and coumadin.

4. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
   - Temperature: 36.9 C (98.4 F)
   - Heart rate: 91 bpm (normal range: 78 - 95 bpm)
   - Blood pressure: 93/40 mmHg (normal range: 85/34 - 119/63 mmHg)
   - Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (normal range: 16 - 25 breaths per minute)
   - Oxygen saturation: 97%
   - Heart rhythm: First degree AV block

5. The patient has a weight of 118.9 kg, which is slightly higher than their admission weight of 117.6 kg. The fluid balance shows a total input of 3,243 mL and output of 3,500 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 257 mL.

6. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask, with a ventilator mode set to standby. The tidal volume (Vt) is 494 mL, respiratory rate (RR) is 0 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 50%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 0 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.29.

s baseline. No fever in >24 hours.  On
   Meropenem for osteomyelitis which has very broad coverage including
   intra-abdominal organisms.
   - follow up surgery recs
   - ostomy care
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**].
   - Continue wound care
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem
   - Pain control with fentanyl [**Last Name (LF) 7634**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] increase fenatnyl patch to
   75mg/hr; will caution increasing Oxycodone given his history
   hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use
   - chronic pain service saw and had several recommendations as above-
   will likely continue to increase narctoics as other options are less
   feasible
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - BIPAP at night with higher narcotics for pain controll to allow for
   sleep
   - Cautios narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.
   # Hypotension:  Resolved, bp

   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR 2.1 on heparin gtt
   bridging to coumadin
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Coumadin restarted with heparin bridge, will likely be able to d/c

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly, obese male who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, as indicated by his need for ventilatory support and hypercarbic respiratory failure. This indicates an impaired ability to breathe properly, which may worsen over time if not properly managed.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring hemodialysis (HD) due to diabetic nephropathy. This condition can lead to further deterioration of kidney function and may require ongoing management and treatment.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and requires ongoing management of blood sugar levels. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can occur as a complication of diabetes medications or insulin therapy.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which has required a diverting colostomy. Poor skin integrity can lead to increased risk of infections and pressure ulcers.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke. Monitoring and management of this condition are necessary.

6. Osteomyelitis: The patient has osteomyelitis, an infection in the bones, which"

s baseline. No fever in >24 hours.  On
   Meropenem for osteomyelitis which has very broad coverage including
   intra-abdominal organisms.
   - follow up surgery recs
   - ostomy care
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**].
   - Continue wound care
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with meropenem
   - Pain control with fentanyl [**Last Name (LF) 7634**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] increase fenatnyl patch to
   75mg/hr; will caution increasing Oxycodone given his history
   hypercapneic respiratory failure [**1-18**] narcotic use
   - chronic pain service saw and had several recommendations as above-
   will likely continue to increase narctoics as other options are less
   feasible
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - BIPAP at night with higher narcotics for pain controll to allow for
   sleep
   - Cautios narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.

   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR 2.1 on heparin gtt
   bridging to coumadin
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Coumadin restarted with heparin bridge, will likely be able to d/c

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The note outlines various problems and plans for management.

1. HYPOGLYCEMIA: The patient has had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia. It is important to monitor blood glucose levels closely and adjust insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication as necessary.

2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB. The INR is currently within therapeutic range, and the patient is being bridged to coumadin. The goal is to maintain a stable INR and monitor for any signs of active cardiac ischemia.

3. RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis due to diabetic nephropathy. It is crucial to monitor the HD line site for any signs of infection and follow-up with renal recommendations. Hematocrit should be maintained above 21, and erythropoietin (epo) should be administered during hemodialysis.

4. DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: The patient's diabetes should be managed with regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate adjustment of medications.

5. IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY: The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer that required a diverting colostomy. Wound care should continue, along with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover"

- He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure (ESRD), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and altered mental status.
- The patient underwent a diverting colostomy due to a stage 4 coccygeal ulcer.
- He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem) for osteomyelitis.
- The patient has respiratory failure and is supported by a tracheostomy and bipap ventilation at night.
- His blood glucose levels have been low, possibly due to poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema.
- The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he is off pressors.
- His anemia is likely related to ESRD, and he is being treated with erythropoietin (epo) during dialysis sessions.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.
- He has atrial fibrillation without active issues and is on anticoagulation therapy.
- The patient has osteomyelitis and is being treated with meropenem.
- He has a history of right below-knee amputation (R BKA) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD).

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical complications. The patient has stage IV coccygeal skin breakdown with a diverting colostomy, chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, pain control, hypotension, anemia, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. However, the HPI (history of present illness) mentions low glucose levels, resulting in a reduced dose of insulin. The patient's INR (international normalized ratio) is 5.5, which indicates an increased risk of bleeding and may require adjustment in anticoagulation therapy.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and sulfa medications, as well as unknown allergies. They have been receiving multiple medications including lansoprazole (Prevacid), heparin sodium, dextrose 50%, fentanyl, and others.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/61 mmHg to 130/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, warm skin, and dusky lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented"

   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - BIPAP at night with higher narcotics for pain controll to allow for
   sleep
   - Cautios narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level has decreased by 4 points since yesterday, and he has bloody stool from his colostomy bag. A transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs) is planned to address the anemia, especially considering his end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and current treatment with epoetin.

2. Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient had a diverting colostomy performed on [**1-6**] to manage his stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which was continuously fecally contaminated due to his fecal incontinence. Wound care will continue, along with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with meropenem.

3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient previously had oxygen saturation levels in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. He is currently transitioning to tracheostomy mask during the day and bipap"

   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - BIPAP at night with higher narcotics for pain controll to allow for
   sleep
   - Cautios narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's CBGs have been low, with a recording in the 40s. This may be due to poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema. The patient's insulin doses have not changed, and neither has his tube feed regimen.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which requires ongoing wound care.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and they are currently on tracheostomy support with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. They also require BIPAP at night. Narcotics should be used cautiously as they can contribute to hypercapnic respiratory failure.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low but has resolved and is within their baseline range. Pressors have been successfully weaned off.

5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to diabetic nephropathy. There is surrounding erythema on the HD line, but it has been stable with negative blood cultures.

6. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable, and they will be transfused for a goal HCT > 21. They are receiving epo during HD, and their Hct this morning increased to 23.5.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient's current issues include anemia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, stage IV coccygeal ulcer, hypoglycemia, hypotension, ESRD, and CAD. The patient is on multiple medications and has various lines and catheters in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. The patient will be transfused with packed red blood cells to increase his hemoglobin level above 21%.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has difficulty exhaling carbon dioxide due to his respiratory condition, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This can result in confusion, fatigue, and other systemic effects. The patient is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with a tracheostomy mask during the day and bipap at night.

3. Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia with a complicated hospital course. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequently underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels were in the 70s and he had copious, thick secretions. He is currently on tracheostomy support during the day and bipap at night. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status closely.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's CBGs have been low, recording in the 40s. His insulin doses have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia may be due to poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given the recent procedure. Decreasing Lantus from 28 to 20 to 15 units this morning is recommended.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased by 4 points since yesterday. There is also bloody show from his colostomy bag. Transfusing 1u PRBC and assessing Hct response and need"

   have some bloody show from his colostomy bag. Will transfuse 1u PRBC
   and assess Hct response and need for transfusion. Pt does have ESRD
   currently on Epo treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - transfuse 1u PRBC
   - Will assess response to transfusion

   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - BIPAP at night with higher narcotics for pain controll to allow for
   sleep
   - Cautios narcotic use as this is responsible for his hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  As the patient is still having pain through his
   current doses of narcotics, will increase his pain medications for
   dressing changes and provide ventilatory support prn if repiratory
   depression occurs.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a middle-aged male with multiple medical complications. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure (ESRD), diverting colostomy, stage IV coccygeal ulcer, hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, right below-knee amputation, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

The patient underwent a diverting colostomy due to a stage IV coccygeal ulcer and fecal incontinence. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for osteomyelitis and has a tracheostomy tube in place for respiratory support. His Hct level has been decreasing, indicating possible anemia, which may be related to ESRD. The patient's blood glucose levels have been low, requiring adjustment of insulin doses. He also has hypotension, which has resolved, and is off pressors. His cardiac function shows a dilated left ventricular cavity with an ejection fraction of 50-55%. The patient has atrial fibrillation but is currently stable on anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently low, indicating a risk of recurrent hypoglycemia. This may be due to poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema following recent surgical procedures.

2. Anemia: The patient's Hct level has been decreasing, suggesting anemia"

   - Citalopram 20 mg daily was started for depression and social work was
   consulted.
   - Fentanyl patch was dc'ed and he was changed to oxycodone 20 mg q 3h
   (oxycontin can't be given via the PEG).  With one dose of 20 mg
   oxycodone he became somulent and his SBP's decreased to the low 80's so
   this was changed to oxycodone 10 mg q4h, however he was still somulent
   with 10 mg of oxycodone so he was placed back on a fentanyl patch at
   100 mcg/hr and his fentanyl boluses were increased to 50-150.
   - LFTs were WNL, except albumin which was 1.4.  Lantus was decreased to
   15 units for persistently low finger sticks.
   - am Hct was noted to be 19.6 (from 23.5) so he was transfused 1 unit

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic hypotension. He also has a history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/35 mmHg to 120/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His heart rhythm is first-degree AV block.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.7%, platelet count of 332, creatinine level of 2.1, glucose level of 57 mg/dL, and other abnormalities. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic at 6.3, indicating a high risk of bleeding.

The patient's plan includes continuing ostomy care, transfusing 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC), monitoring post-transfusion Hct, and assessing the need for fresh frozen plasma ("

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Citalopram 20 mg daily was started for depression and social work was
   consulted.
   - Fentanyl patch was dc'ed and he was changed to oxycodone 20 mg q 3h
   (oxycontin can't be given via the PEG).  With one dose of 20 mg
   oxycodone he became somulent and his SBP's decreased to the low 80's so
   this was changed to oxycodone 10 mg q4h, however he was still somulent
   with 10 mg of oxycodone so he was placed back on a fentanyl patch at
   100 mcg/hr and his fentanyl boluses were increased to 50-150.
   - LFTs were WNL, except albumin which was 1.4.  Lantus was decreased to
   15 units for persistently low finger sticks.
   - am Hct was noted to be 19.6 (from 23.5) so he was transfused 1 unit
   of PRBC and his Hct increased to 23.1.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has a history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP), and osteomyelitis.

The patient's recent events include being started on citalopram for depression and social work consultation. His pain has not been controlled with fentanyl, so oxycontin 80 mg was added and will be uptitrated as necessary. He also had a diverting colostomy performed due to a stage IV coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure in the low 80s, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds throughout, a right below-knee amputation (R BKA), and left leg and foot that are dusky with 2+ bilateral upper extremity edema.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. His electrolytes are within normal limits except for a slightly low"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Citalopram 20 mg daily was started for depression and social work was
   consulted.
   - Fentanyl patch was dc'ed and he was changed to oxycodone 20 mg q 3h
   (oxycontin can't be given via the PEG).  With one dose of 20 mg
   oxycodone he became somulent and his SBP's decreased to the low 80's so
   this was changed to oxycodone 10 mg q4h, however he was still somulent
   with 10 mg of oxycodone so he was placed back on a fentanyl patch at
   100 mcg/hr and his fentanyl boluses were increased to 50-150.
   - LFTs were WNL, except albumin which was 1.4.  Lantus was decreased to
   15 units for persistently low finger sticks.
   - am Hct was noted to be 19.6 (from 23.5) so he was transfused 1 unit
   of PRBC and his Hct increased to 23.1.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP), and complicated hospital course. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is now being considered for a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing low blood glucose levels, which may be due to poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema. Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin doses are necessary.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, but currently, there are no active issues. INR levels are supratherapeutic at 6.3 today. Anticoagulation therapy should be restarted once the INR is within the goal range.
3. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis (HD) due to diabetic nephropathy. The HD line has surrounding erythema, but it has been stable with negative blood cultures. Continuous monitoring of the HD line site examination and renal function tests are necessary.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer"

   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**].
   - Continue wound care
   - Pain controlled better with 100 mcg fentanyl patch and lidocaine
   patches.  Has not required fentanyl boluses since [**1-11**].
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - As the patient has not been definitively diagnosed with obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome and is on BIPAP currently, will hold it
   tonight and check a VBG today and once in the am to assess for change
   in PCO2 and the need for BIPAP.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   - Will contact IP about possibly changing his trach as it doesn
   appear to have been changed recently.  Will also see if the granulation
   tissue around the trach can be removed or a smaller trach placed so
   that he might be able to tolerate a Passy-Muir valve.
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low,
   Lantus was decreased recently to 15u. Pt
s insulin doses have not
   changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia may be [**1-18**]
   poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given the recent
   procedure.  His blood sugars have been well controlled on 15 units.
   - Continue decreased dose of lantus 15 units.  Will decrease the dosage
   of his sliding scale insulin as he appears to drop after correction.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression.
   - Continue citalopram 20 mg daily and uptitrate for response.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) episodes. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require tracheostomy support and bipap ventilation. Close monitoring of blood gases and respiratory status is necessary.
2. Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which required a diverting colostomy. Wound care and infection control measures should be continued.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels, but as he has ESRD, ongoing monitoring and possible transfusion goal of Hct >21% may be required.
4. Osteomyelitis: The patient had osteomyelitis, which was treated with a 6-week course of meropenem. There are currently no active issues related to osteomyelitis.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been low, possibly due to poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema. Decreased"

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**] -
   decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that was
   continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal incontinence.

s baseline. No fever in >24 hours.  On
   Meropenem course for osteomyelitis finished yesterday. Surgery has
   signed off.
   - continue ostomy care
   # Anemia: Hct today noted to be down 4 pts since yesterday, pt does
   have some bloody show from his colostomy bag. Pt was transfused 1u PRBC
   yesterday, Hct currently stable. Pt does have ESRD currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**].
   - Continue wound care
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - BIPAP at night with higher narcotics for pain controll to allow for
   sleep
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low with
   a recording in the 40s yesterday, Lantus was decreased yesterday to
   15u. Pt
s insulin doses have not changed and neither has his tube feed
   regimen. Hypoglycemia may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from
   bowel wall edema given the recent procedure.
   - Decrease Lantus from 28 to 20 to 15 yesterday.
   - Will check LFTs
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression.
   - Will start citalopram 20 mg daily and uptitrate for response.
   - Social work consult for coping.
   # Hypotension:  Resolved, bp

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), DM2 (type 2 diabetes), infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient has undergone several interventions and surgeries, including a diverting colostomy for his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, anemia, stage IV coccygeal ulcer, hypoglycemia, depression, hypotension, ESRD, CAD (coronary artery disease), atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, right below-knee amputation/prosthetic vascular disease (R BKA/PVD), and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure due to inadequate tracheostomy care or secretion management, further deterioration of the stage IV coccygeal ulcer leading to infection or non-healing, persistent anemia requiring frequent blood transfusions, recurrent hypoglycemic episodes due to poor absorption of tube feeds, worsening of depression symptoms leading to decreased quality of life, persistent hypotension requiring continuous midodrine administration, progression of renal failure necessitating adjustments in dialysis therapy, cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or ischemic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient has been transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and recently underwent a diverting colostomy to facilitate healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy and COPD. His current condition of hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates a potential risk for worsening respiratory function.

2. Infection: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and a history of multiple VAP/HAP episodes. There is a risk of developing further infections, especially in the presence of the diverting colostomy.

3. Renal insufficiency: The patient has ESRD due to diabetic nephropathy and is on hemodialysis. His renal function should be closely monitored for any deterioration.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been low recently, possibly due to poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema. Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin doses are necessary to prevent hypoglycemia.

   - Pain controlled better with 100 mcg fentanyl patch and lidocaine
   patches.  Has not required fentanyl boluses since [**1-11**].
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - As the patient has not been definitively diagnosed with obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome and is on BIPAP currently, will hold it
   tonight and check a VBG today and once in the am to assess for change
   in PCO2 and the need for BIPAP.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   - Will contact IP about possibly changing his trach as it doesn
   appear to have been changed recently.  Will also see if the granulation
   tissue around the trach can be removed or a smaller trach placed so
   that he might be able to tolerate a Passy-Muir valve.

s insulin doses have not
   changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia may be [**1-18**]
   poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given the recent
   procedure.  His blood sugars have been well controlled on 15 units.
   - Continue decreased dose of lantus 15 units.  Will decrease the dosage
   of his sliding scale insulin as he appears to drop after correction.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequently underwent a diverting colostomy to allow healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a risk for ongoing respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing low blood glucose levels, which can lead to serious complications if not managed appropriately. Adjustments in insulin dosages and close monitoring of blood glucose levels are essential.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate perfusion and organ function. Monitoring and management of blood pressure through appropriate medications and fluid resuscitation are crucial.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requires ongoing hemodialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of dialysis parameters are necessary.

5. Osteomyelitis: Although the patient has completed a 6-week course of meropenem, there is still a risk of ongoing"

   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - As the patient has not been definitively diagnosed with obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome and is on BIPAP currently, BIPAP held
   overnight and VBG unchanged this morning 7.28/72/43 -----> 7.23/64/38.
   This morning
s gas appears to be arterial though patient does not have

   not have obesity hypoventilation syndrome and does not need BIPAP
   overnight.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   - plan today for bedside bronch to see if there is granulation tissue
   causing increased pressure and will replace current trach tube with a
   smaller one to see if that will allow patient to tolerate passy-muir
   valve.
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 15u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  His blood sugars have continued to be low (56
   this morning) on 15 units.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   -will decreased Lantus to 10u qd

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical complications, including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has a history of infections and has undergone various medical interventions.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, for which he is on tracheostomy (trach) mask support during the day and bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) at night. He also has a diverting colostomy due to a stage IV coccygeal ulcer. His blood glucose levels have been low, and adjustments to his insulin dosage have been made. He is also on citalopram for depression and midodrine for hypotension.

The patient has a long-standing history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ESRD, diabetes mellitus type II, and a recent surgical procedure. He has an atrial fibrillation (AFIB) history but is currently not on anticoagulant therapy due to a supratherapeutic INR. He also has osteomyelitis, a right below-knee amputation (R BKA/PVD), and plasma cell dyscrasia.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), glucose levels, and other electrolyte levels. His arterial"

   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**] -
   decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that was
   continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal incontinence.
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag
   - continue ostomy care
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 26.2. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**] as above
   - Continue wound care
   - Pain controlled better with 100 mcg fentanyl patch and lidocaine
   patches.  Has not required fentanyl boluses since [**1-11**].
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - As the patient has not been definitively diagnosed with obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome and is on BIPAP currently, BIPAP held
   overnight and gas actually improved 7.35/57/122 (changed from last
   night of  7.28/72/43).  This morning
s gas appears to be arterial
   though patient does not have an A-line, will repeat but if true values,
   suggests that patient does not have obesity hypoventilation syndrome
   and does not need BIPAP overnight.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   - plan today for bedside bronch to see if there is granulation tissue
   causing increased pressure and will replace current trach tube with a
   smaller one to see if that will allow patient to tolerate passy-muir
   valve.
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 15u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  His blood sugars have been well controlled on 15
   units.
   - Continue decreased dose of lantus 15 units.  Will decrease the dosage
   of his sliding scale insulin as he appears to drop after correction
   consider decreasing further.  Possible that now that patient is no
   longer infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin

   of depression give his current medical situation

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 107/45 mmHg to 132/59 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated creatinine level, and low glucose levels. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, renal failure (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is currently on tracheostomy support and BiPAP. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the tracheostomy tube becomes blocked or if there are complications with the BiPAP settings.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course, requiring ventilatory support. He has a history of ESRD, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, chronic respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 102/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and increased creatinine levels. The assessment and plan include continued ventilatory support, bronchoscopy to evaluate for possible intervention, continuation of dialysis, and management of other medical problems such as hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing need for ventilatory support indicates respiratory failure. Potential complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), or worsening hypoxemia.

2. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's renal failure has progressed to end-stage renal disease. Complications may include electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, anemia, and increased risk of infections.

   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Evening BIPAP d/c
ed as the patient has not been definitively diagnosed
   with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. BIPAP held 2 nights ago and VBG
   unchanged from evening to morning 7.28/72/43 -----> 7.23/64/38

   Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that doesn
t allow air
   flow when PM valve is in place and make the patient unable to tolerate
   the valve
   - Continue trach mask support
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   - per IP, if could replace trach tube but needs to be optimized from a
   pulmonary status which he is not currently
 specifically, would need
   drainage of pleural effusions and diuresis to minimize his CHF
   this point, pressures remain in 80
s and would not likely tolerate
   diuresis
 also per IP, unclear if replacing tube with smaller size
   would in fact allow patient to tolerate valve
   - discussed with family who agrees no replacement of tube for now given
   low BP and unclear outcome of prodcedure
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up , at 16 this morning up from 14,
   diff with left shift (N = 85, L= 5), but no bands.  Has been afebrile,
   no symptoms of infection.
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given

   # Anemia: Hct stable at 26.2. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**] as above
   - Continue wound care
   - Pain controlled better with 100 mcg fentanyl patch and lidocaine
   patches.  Has not required fentanyl boluses since [**1-11**].
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 15u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  His blood sugars have continued to be low (56
   this morning) on 15 units.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   -will decreased Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Continue citalopram 20 mg daily and uptitrate for response.
   - Social work consult for coping.
   # Hypotension:  Resolved, bp

   also mentating at baseline.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs

   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR supratherapeutic at 4.0

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**] -
   decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that was
   continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal incontinence.
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag
   - continue ostomy care
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 26.2. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**] as above
   - Continue wound care
   - Pain controlled better with 100 mcg fentanyl patch and lidocaine
   patches.  Has not required fentanyl boluses since [**1-11**].
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer to have
   oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Pt currently
   transitioned to trach mask during the day and Bipap at night.  He
   continues to do well on these settings.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - As the patient has not been definitively diagnosed with obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome and is on BIPAP currently, BIPAP held
   overnight and VBG unchanged this morning 7.28/72/43 -----> 7.23/64/38.
   This morning
s gas appears to be arterial though patient does not have
   an A-line, will repeat but if true values, suggests that patient does
   not have obesity hypoventilation syndrome and does not need BIPAP
   overnight.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   - plan today for bedside bronch to see if there is granulation tissue
   causing increased pressure and will replace current trach tube with a
   smaller one to see if that will allow patient to tolerate passy-muir
   valve.
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 15u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  His blood sugars have continued to be low (56
   this morning) on 15 units.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   -will decreased Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Continue citalopram 20 mg daily and uptitrate for response.
   - Social work consult for coping.
   # Hypotension:  Resolved, bp
s in 90
s which is patient
s baseline,
   also mentating at baseline.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR supratherapeutic at 4.0
   today
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR.  Will restart once his INR
   is within in goal range of [**1-19**].
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with several medical conditions including hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, renal failure (end stage), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, respiratory failure (chronic), and hypertension. 

The patient has been hospitalized for a prolonged period and requires ongoing dialysis. There has been some improvement in the patient's tolerance of time off the ventilator, and sepsis has been controlled through a diverting ostomy, leading to improved wound care in the ulcer area. The patient will continue with tracheostomy mask ventilation, dialysis, and ostomy care. 

The patient's white blood cell count is rising, and pain control and sedation levels are being monitored. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's chronic respiratory failure and impaired skin integrity could increase the risk of infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The end-stage renal disease (ESRD) increases the risk of electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload. The altered mental status may pose challenges in assessing and managing the patient's pain and discomfort. 

Overall, the patient's medical conditions and current treatment plan require careful monitoring and management to prevent and manage potential complications."

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Evening BIPAP d/c
ed as the patient has not been definitively diagnosed
   with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. BIPAP held 2 nights ago and VBG
   unchanged from evening to morning 7.28/72/43 -----> 7.23/64/38
   suggesting BIPAP not needed.  Bedside bronch done yesterday showing no
   granulation tissue at or above trach stie, unable to see below.
   Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that doesn
t allow air
   flow when PM valve is in place and make the patient unable to tolerate
   the valve
   - Continue trach mask support
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   - per IP, if could replace trach tube but needs to be optimized from a
   pulmonary status which he is not currently
 specifically, would need
   drainage of pleural effusions and diuresis to minimize his CHF
   this point, pressures remain in 80
s and would not likely tolerate
   diuresis
 also per IP, unclear if replacing tube with smaller size
   would in fact allow patient to tolerate valve
   - discussed with family who agrees no replacement of tube for now given
   low BP and unclear outcome of prodcedure
   # Leukocytosis:  Currently stable at 13.  Has been afebrile, no
   symptoms of infection.
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given
   known osteeo (finished meropenem several days ago, stage 4 sacral ulcer
   and recent bowel manipulation.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**] -
   decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that was
   continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal incontinence.
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) 2090**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7712**] skin necrosis at ostomy site when bag was
   changed because the bridge has tension on it
 surgery aware
   - continue ostomy care
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 26.2. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**] as above
   - Continue wound care
   - Pain controlled better with 100 mcg fentanyl patch and lidocaine
   patches.  Has not required fentanyl boluses since [**1-11**].
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 15u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  His blood sugars have continued to be low (56
   this morning) on 15 units.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   -will decreased Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Continue citalopram 20 mg daily and uptitrate for response.
   - Social work consult for coping.
   # Hypotension:  Resolved, bp
s in 90
s which is patient
s baseline,
   also mentating at baseline.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR supratherapeutic at 4.0
   today
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR.  Will restart once his INR
   is within in goal range of [**1-19**].
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p

2. The patient has a complicated hospital course with multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) episodes.

3. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his stage IV coccygeal ulcer.

4. The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing need for tracheostomy support, and there are concerns about tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis preventing the use of a bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) device.

5. The patient has leukocytosis, which is currently stable and without signs of infection. However, due to his history of osteomyelitis and recent bowel manipulation, there is a low threshold for starting antibiotics.

6. The patient had a diverting colostomy performed on [**1-6**] to address his stage IV coccygeal ulcer. The surgical site is showing signs of healing, but there is tension on the bridge causing skin necrosis at the ostomy"

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Evening BIPAP d/c
ed as the patient has not been definitively diagnosed
   with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. BIPAP held 2 nights ago and VBG
   unchanged from evening to morning 7.28/72/43 -----> 7.23/64/38
   suggesting BIPAP not needed.  Bedside bronch done yesterday showing no
   granulation tissue at or above trach stie, unable to see below.
   Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that doesn
t allow air
   flow when PM valve is in place and make the patient unable to tolerate
   the valve
   - Continue trach mask support
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   - per IP, if could replace trach tube but needs to be optimized from a
   pulmonary status which he is not currently
 specifically, would need
   drainage of pleural effusions and diuresis to minimize his CHF
   this point, pressures remain in 80
s and would not likely tolerate
   diuresis
 also per IP, unclear if replacing tube with smaller size
   would in fact allow patient to tolerate valve
   - discussed with family who agrees no replacement of tube for now given
   low BP and unclear outcome of prodcedure
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up , at 16 this morning up from 14,
   diff with left shift (N = 85, L= 5), but no bands.  Has been afebrile,
   no symptoms of infection.
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given
   known osteeo (finished meropenem several days ago, stage 4 sacral ulcer
   and recent bowel manipulation.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**] -
   decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that was
   continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal incontinence.
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) 2090**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7712**] skin necrosis at ostomy site when bag was
   changed because the bridge has tension on it
 surgery aware
   - continue ostomy care
   - f/u surgery recs
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 26.2. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**] as above
   - Continue wound care
   - Pain controlled better with 100 mcg fentanyl patch and lidocaine
   patches.  Has not required fentanyl boluses since [**1-11**].
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 15u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  His blood sugars have continued to be low (56
   this morning) on 15 units.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   -will decreased Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Continue citalopram 20 mg daily and uptitrate for response.
   - Social work consult for coping.
   # Hypotension:  Resolved, bp
s in 90
s which is patient
s baseline,
   also mentating at baseline.
   - continue midodrine
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR supratherapeutic at 4.0
   today
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   - Hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR.  Will restart once his INR
   is within in goal range of [**1-19**].
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on tracheal mask support. The patient also has a diverting colostomy due to a stage IV coccygeal ulcer. His recent history includes leukocytosis, anemia, and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a potential risk for further respiratory compromise. Monitoring and optimizing pulmonary status through interventions like tracheal tube replacement, diuresis, and drainage of pleural effusions will be crucial.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management with dialysis. Close monitoring of renal function and adherence to dialysis schedule are essential to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

3. Diabetic Complications: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type II increases the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Strict glycemic control is necessary to prevent these complications.

4. Wound Infection: The patient's stage IV coccygeal ulcer and recent surgical procedure increase the risk of wound infection. Regular assessment of wound healing, infection parameters, and appropriate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has several medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and a history of diverting colostomy. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) and required a fluid bolus afterwards. He is currently on multiple medications including lansoprazole, colace, lidocaine, epo, mitodrine, atrovent, albuterol, ferrous sulfate, Zocor, celexa, fentanyl, and others.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60-101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, overweight/obese status, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and no cyanosis or clubbing in the extremities. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, normal tone, and no sedation or paralysis.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, elevated white"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Evening BIPAP d/c
ed as the patient has not been definitively diagnosed
   with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. BIPAP held 2 nights ago and VBG
   unchanged from evening to morning 7.28/72/43 -----> 7.23/64/38
   suggesting BIPAP not needed.  Bedside bronch done yesterday showing no
   granulation tissue at or above trach stie, unable to see below.
   Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that doesn
t allow air
   flow when PM valve is in place and make the patient unable to tolerate
   the valve
   - Continue trach mask support
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   - per IP, if could replace trach tube but needs to be optimized from a
   pulmonary status which he is not currently
 specifically, would need
   drainage of pleural effusions and diuresis to minimize his CHF
   this point, pressures remain in 80
s and would not likely tolerate
   diuresis
 also per IP, unclear if replacing tube with smaller size
   would in fact allow patient to tolerate valve
   - discussed with family who agrees no replacement of tube for now given
   low BP and unclear outcome of prodcedure
   # Leukocytosis:  Slowly trending up , at 16 this morning up from 14,
   diff with left shift (N = 85, L= 5), but no bands.  Has been afebrile,
   no symptoms of infection.
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given
   known osteeo (finished meropenem several days ago, stage 4 sacral ulcer
   and recent bowel manipulation.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**] -
   decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that was
   continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal incontinence.
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) 2090**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7712**] skin necrosis at ostomy site when bag was
   changed because the bridge has tension on it
 surgery aware
   - continue ostomy care
   - f/u surgery recs
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 26.2. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), DM2 (type 2 diabetes), infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in eliminating carbon dioxide from the body, leading to high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This can result in respiratory acidosis and potential complications such as confusion, decreased consciousness, and increased risk of infection.

2. Tracheomalacia or Tracheal Stenosis: The patient's inability to tolerate a tracheostomy valve suggests the possibility of tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis. This can cause airway obstruction and difficulty in ventilation, leading to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slowly trending up, indicating a possible infection. With the patient's history of multiple prior VAP/HAP and stage 4 sacral ulcer, there is an increased risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**] as above
   - Continue wound care
   - Pain controlled better with 100 mcg fentanyl patch and lidocaine
   patches.  Has not required fentanyl boluses since [**1-11**].  Still having a
   lot of pain with dressing changes.  Will try morphine oral concentrate
   solution prn for dressing changes.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Evening BIPAP d/c
ed as the patient has not been definitively diagnosed
   with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. BIPAP held 2 nights ago and VBG
   unchanged from evening to morning 7.28/72/43 -----> 7.23/64/38
   suggesting BIPAP not needed.  Bedside bronch done yesterday showing no
   granulation tissue at or above trach stie, unable to see below.
   Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that doesn
t allow air
   flow when PM valve is in place and make the patient unable to tolerate
   the valve.  Per IP, if could replace trach tube but needs to be
   optimized from a pulmonary status which he is not currently
   specifically, would need drainage of pleural effusions and diuresis to
   minimize his CHF
 at this point, pressures remain in 80
s and would
   not likely tolerate diuresis
 also per IP, unclear if replacing tube
   with smaller size would in fact allow patient to tolerate valve This
   was discussed with family who agrees no replacement of tube for now
   given low BP and unclear outcome of procedure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) with a complicated hospital course. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which required a diverting colostomy for healing. Proper wound care and pain management are necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels in the 70s and copious, thick secretions indicate hypercarbic respiratory failure. The use of BiPAP was considered but not necessary as the patient's ventilation improved. Continuous tracheostomy support and nebulizer treatments with Atrovent and albuterol are required to maintain adequate respiratory function.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Monitoring the trend of the WBC count and fever curve is important, and starting antibiotic therapy should be considered given the patient's history of osteomyelitis, recent bowel manipulation, and stage 4 sacral ulcer.

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: Family meeting was held and pt decided on
   diverting colostomy which was done on the evening of [**1-6**] as above
   - Continue wound care
   - Pain controlled better with 100 mcg fentanyl patch and lidocaine
   patches.  Has not required fentanyl boluses since [**1-11**].  Still having a
   lot of pain with dressing changes.  Will try morphine oral concentrate
   solution prn for dressing changes.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Evening BIPAP d/c
ed as the patient has not been definitively diagnosed
   with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. BIPAP held 2 nights ago and VBG
   unchanged from evening to morning 7.28/72/43 -----> 7.23/64/38
   suggesting BIPAP not needed.  Bedside bronch done yesterday showing no
   granulation tissue at or above trach stie, unable to see below.
   Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that doesn
t allow air
   flow when PM valve is in place and make the patient unable to tolerate
   the valve.  Per IP, if could replace trach tube but needs to be
   optimized from a pulmonary status which he is not currently
   specifically, would need drainage of pleural effusions and diuresis to
   minimize his CHF
 at this point, pressures remain in 80
s and would
   not likely tolerate diuresis
 also per IP, unclear if replacing tube
   with smaller size would in fact allow patient to tolerate valve This
   was discussed with family who agrees no replacement of tube for now
   given low BP and unclear outcome of procedure.
   - Continue trach mask support
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # Leukocytosis:  Trended down yesterday to 13.8 (from 16.4). Has been
   afebrile, no symptoms of infection.
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given
   known osteeo (finished meropenem several days ago, stage 4 sacral ulcer
   and recent bowel manipulation.

   decision was made to do so give his stage 4 coccygeal ulcer that was
   continuously fecally contaminated give patient's fecal incontinence.
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.

   Epo treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   - continue decreased Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Will increase citalopram to 30 mg daily and uptitrate for response.
   - Social work consult for coping.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM type II, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current issues include stage IV coccygeal ulcer, hypercarbic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, s/p diverting colostomy, anemia, hypoglycemia, depression, hypotension, ESRD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, right below-knee amputation/prosthetic vascular disease, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Medical Complications:
1. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient had a diverting colostomy performed to allow for healing of the infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer. The wound care nurse observed skin necrosis at the ostomy site due to tension on the bridge. Surgery is aware of this issue.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels were in the 70s, and he had thick secretions. BIPAP was attempted but not definitively diagnosed as needed. The patient is suspected to have tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and recently underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient has a history of an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer for which he underwent a diverting colostomy. The wound care and plastic surgery consultation should continue to address this issue.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's prior transfer was due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, with oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. Tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis may be suspected as the cause of the inability to tolerate the PM valve. Continued tracheostomy mask support, Atrovent nebs, and prn albuterol nebs are recommended. Replacement of the tracheostomy tube in the morning is also advised.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, but"

   No mediastinal air noted.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo male with prolonged hospital course now c/b significant evolution
   of hypotension and requiring return to mechanical ventilation last
   evening.  The source of this remains to be defined.  He on CXR shows
   minimal evidence of significant change and no mediastinal air is seen.
   Concerning is the evolution of intermittent hypotension.  The source is
   still multifactorial
he has poor po access with G-tube malfunction and
   inability to deliver po midodrine.  He has intermittent difficulty with
   airway support and inabilty to ventilate with return to mechanical
   ventilation.  No evidence of mediastinal air seen.  He has fluid
   responsive hypotension at this time with relatively small volumes
   given.
   1)Hypotension-
   -Reculture for possible infectious source
   -Will check for pseudosepsis
with TSH, Cortisol
   -In absence of fever would consider recurrent bacterial infection less
   likely but is the most likely source.
   -ECG without abnormalities, will check ECHO today
   -Will let culture results dictate catheter changes
   -Will have to keep fluid balance even and consider CVVH if persistent
   hypotension seen.
   -Will have to re-examine line site with patient in position able to be
   viewed (patient in middle of turn during exam)
   -In regards to PE possibility
patient is with  elevated INR at this
   time.
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Patient to trach mask this morning with good stability
   -Return to MV
   -Patient will need consideration of [**Last Name (un) **] for longer tube and
   stability given difficulty with ventilation acutely last evening
   -Will continue on ventilator as needed but would favor patient return
   to nocturnal ventilation

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course who is currently experiencing significant evolution of hypotension and requiring return to mechanical ventilation. The source of this remains to be defined. The patient has poor peripheral access with a G-tube malfunction and inability to deliver oral midodrine. He also has intermittent difficulty with airway support and inability to ventilate, requiring mechanical ventilation. No evidence of mediastinal air is seen.

The patient has fluid responsive hypotension at this time with relatively small volumes given. The assessment and plan include the following:

1) Hypotension:
- Reculture for possible infectious source
- Will check for pseudosepsis with TSH, Cortisol
- In absence of fever would consider recurrent bacterial infection less likely but is the most likely source.
- ECG without abnormalities, will check ECHO today
- Will let culture results dictate catheter changes
- Will have to keep fluid balance even and consider CVVH if persistent hypotension seen.
- Will have to re-examine line site with patient in position able to be viewed (patient in middle of turn during exam)
- In regards to PE possibility, patient is with elevated INR at this time.

2) Respiratory Failure:
- Patient to trach mask this morning with good stability
- Return to MV
- Patient will need consideration of [Last Name (un)] for longer tube and stability given difficulty with ventilation ac"

s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin

   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily- increased last weekend.
   - Social work following
   -OT consulted for possible other ways to communicate
   # Hypotension- Today on and off Levo with decreased mentation and SBP
   down to 70s
   - continue midodrine
   -Wean levo as tolerated
   -Rechk cortisol, TSH and free T4 today
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is now scheduled for a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his stage IV coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which requires ongoing wound care and surgical intervention. There is a risk of infection and potential complications related to the surgical procedure.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent complications such as hypotension and altered mental status.
3. ESRD: The patient has ESRD, requiring ongoing hemodialysis (HD). There is a risk of infection at the HD line site, as well as complications related to the underlying diabetic nephropathy.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of hypoglycemia, which may be attributed to poor absorption of tube feeds due to bowel wall edema or a decrease in insulin requirements with improved glycemic control.
5. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, requiring ongoing management with vasopressors. There is a risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer that required a diverting colostomy. The wound care should be continued, and plastics will further debride and possibly place a wound vac.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure with oxygen sats in the 70s and thick secretions. The ventilator settings are being adjusted, and the patient is being weaned on CPAP.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient had leukocytosis, but it is now declining. There are no symptoms of infection, but given the patient's osteo stage 4 sacral ulcer and recent bowel manipulation, there is a low threshold for starting antibiotics.

4. S/P Diverting Colostomy: The patient had a diverting colostomy on [**1-6**]. The surgery has signed off, and the ostomy nurse will continue ostomy care. The bridge still needs to be removed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and required intermittent mechanical ventilation. The source of hypotension is likely multifactorial, including poor po access and inability to deliver midodrine. However, with the placement of a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube, the hypotension has resolved.

The patient has multiple ongoing issues that require attention:
1. Hypotension - The patient's blood pressure should be monitored throughout the day.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient requires mechanical ventilation as needed. An attempt will be made to fix the tracheostomy (trach) today.
3. Colostomy - Surgery will be performed to remove the bridge today.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) - Hemodialysis (HD) will be conducted tomorrow.
5. Anticoagulation - Coumadin will be restarted when the INR (International Normalized Ratio) is less than 2.0 for a fib.
6. Wound - Plastics will assess the wound today regarding debridement versus wound vac.
7. Disposition - The patient will be transferred to Hospital1 and should have a bed available by Thursday.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC Line and Dialysis Catheter), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP), and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course. He has experienced significant evolution of hypotension and has required intermittent mechanical ventilation. The source of his hypotension is likely multifactorial, including poor access for delivering medication and a malfunctioning gastrointestinal tube. His current issues include hypotension (resolved), respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, a colostomy that needs surgical removal of a bridge, end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, anticoagulation with Coumadin, and wound management. The patient has been accepted by Hospital1 and is expected to have a bed available by Thursday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has been resolved but should be closely monitored to ensure it does not recur.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation and may need further interventions to improve respiratory function.
3. Colostomy: The planned surgery to remove the bridge in the colostomy is necessary to address any obstructions or complications.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's ESRD requires management through hemodialysis, which will help filter waste products and maintain electrolyte balance.
5. Anticoagulation: Restarting Coumadin therapy is essential to prevent blood clot formation, but careful monitoring of the INR levels is crucial to avoid excessive bleeding.
6. Wound Management: The patient's wounds require evaluation and appropriate management, including de"

   improving. Plastics came by yesterday and said no further debridement
   was needed at this time. Cont current wound care,
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Most recent bronch showing no granulation tissue at or above trach
   stie, unable to see below.  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal
   stenosis that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make
   the patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now
   - Continue ventilator- trying to wean on CPAP today
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # Leukocytosis:  Back up to 11 today from 6.9 yesterday.  Has been
   afebrile, no symptoms of infection. Although has been hypotensive as
   late as [**1-18**] and ? cardiac vs infectious vs autonomic instability
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given
   known osteo (finished meropenem [**1-11**]) stage 4 sacral ulcer.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.

   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less

   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily- increased last weekend.
   - Social work following

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. The patient is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty with ventilation, which is causing an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This can lead to respiratory acidosis and other complications if not managed properly.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's CBGs have been low, indicating hypoglycemia. This could be due to poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema or a decrease in insulin requirements as the infection resolves.

3. Anemia: The patient has a stable Hct level of 26, but with ESRD and ongoing treatment with Epo, there is a risk of further anemia development. Close monitoring and potential transfusion may be necessary.

4. Depression: The patient has shown signs of decreased interest and depression given his current medical situation. Appropriate management with antidepressants and social work follow-up is important.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, and he has been weaned off Levo. Further investigation into the cause of hyp"

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac. Cont
   current wound care,
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Most recent bronch showing no granulation tissue at or above trach
   stie, unable to see below.  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal
   stenosis that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make
   the patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now
   - Continue ventilator- PS weaned to [**7-21**] for now. Unable to wean further
   [**1-18**] low tidal volumes.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # Leukocytosis:  Rising slightly today from 11 to 12.  Has been
   afebrile, no symptoms of infection. Although has been hypotensive as
   late as [**1-18**] and ? cardiac vs infectious vs autonomic instability
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given
   known osteo (finished meropenem [**1-11**]) stage 4 sacral ulcer.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Bridge removed by surgery yesterday and stated no evidence of
   surrounding necrosis or cellulitis. Pt at high risk of ostomy pulling
   back into abd.
   - continue ostomy care
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 24 today. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   - continue Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily- increased last weekend.
   - Social work following
   -OT consulted for possible other ways to communicate
    # Hypotension- Currently weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and
   free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid. Should recheck as outpt.
   Cortisol [**1-18**] nl at 19.
   - continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs in past.  HD [**1-20**] with 3L UFV removed.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF.
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR today 1.9.
   -restart coumadin at 2 today
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequent diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Medical Complications:

1. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient had a diverting colostomy performed on [1-6]. The wound appears to be improving, and plastics debrided extensively on [1-20]. The patient's pain is controlled reasonably well with fentanyl patch, lidocaine patches, and morphine PRN.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels were in the 70s prior to transfer, and he had copious, thick secretions. Bronchoscopy showed no granulation tissue at or above the tracheostomy site, suggesting possible tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis preventing air flow when the pressure support (PS) valve is in place. The trachea has been positional for ventilation but no specific problem was found, so it will be left as is for now. Ventilator settings have been weaned to PS [7-21] for now, unable to wean further [1-18] with low tidal volumes.

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics came by yesterday and said no further debridement
   was needed at this time. Cont current wound care,
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Most recent bronch showing no granulation tissue at or above trach
   stie, unable to see below.  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal
   stenosis that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make
   the patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now
   - Continue ventilator- trying to wean on CPAP today
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # Leukocytosis:  Back up to 11 today from 6.9 yesterday.  Has been
   afebrile, no symptoms of infection. Although has been hypotensive as
   late as [**1-18**] and ? cardiac vs infectious vs autonomic instability
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given
   known osteo (finished meropenem [**1-11**]) stage 4 sacral ulcer.
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   - per ostomy nurse, bridge still in. Surgery contact[**Name (NI) **] to remove it-

   # Anemia: Hct stable at 25 today. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   - continue Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily- increased last weekend.
   - Social work following
   -OT consulted for possible other ways to communicate
    # Hypotension- Currently weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and
   free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid. Should recheck as outpt.
   Cortisol [**1-18**] nl at 19.

   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs in past.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam

   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR today 1.9.
   -restart coumadin at 2 today
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone a diverting colostomy. The patient's medical history includes hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, depression, hypotension, and CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure. This indicates a potential complication related to impaired gas exchange and ventilation.
2. Infected Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which may lead to further complications such as osteomyelitis or systemic infection if not properly managed.
3. ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease): The patient has ESRD due to diabetic nephropathy. This condition requires ongoing management with dialysis and poses a risk for fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. DM2 (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus): The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which needs to be managed with insulin therapy and dietary control to prevent complications like hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course complicated by persistent ventilatory failure and renal failure. He also has a sacral decubitus that requires continued debridement. The patient has been started on Coumadin now that the INR has decreased to a therapeutic range. He remains afebrile and has shown excellent tolerance of dialysis yesterday. Ventilatory support remains at baseline, and pain control is being provided with patch + pRN medications following debridement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient is currently on PSV support and will need to be weaned off ventilatory support as possible. Antibiotics may be discontinued if there is no evidence of infection.
2. Renal Failure - The patient is undergoing hemodialysis, which is well-tolerated. This will continue on a three times weekly basis.
3. Sacral Decubitus - The wound vac will be continued when placed by plastic surgery. The patient has shown a good response to debridement.
4. Hypoglycemia - The patient has had an episode of low blood sugar and should be monitored closely for any further episodes.
5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB) - The patient has a history of irregular heart rhythm and should continue to be monitored for this condition.
6. End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) - The patient's renal function has progressed to end stage renal disease, and further management"

    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Most recent bronch showing no granulation tissue at or above trach
   stie, unable to see below.  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal
   stenosis that doesn

s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several procedures including a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer and extensive debridement of the wound with placement of a wound vacuum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer for which he underwent a diverting colostomy. There is a risk of the ostomy pulling back into the abdomen.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels were in the 70s prior to transfer, and he had copious, thick secretions. There is a concern for tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that may be causing airway obstruction when the pressure support ventilation (PS) valve is in place.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is rising slightly, which may indicate an infection. However, he is afebrile and has no symptoms of infection.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing low blood glucose levels, especially after an OR procedure. This could be due to poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall ed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, hypotension, and a history of osteomyelitis in a stage IV coccygeal ulcer.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone several procedures including a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. He also has a tracheostomy in place, which may be causing some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis, leading to difficulty in ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/40 mmHg to 113/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 50%.

His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, anemia, and altered liver function tests. The patient is on multiple medications including heparin sodium, regular insulin sliding scale, midodrine, citalopram, and various other medications for his chronic conditions"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course complicated by persistent ventilatory failure and renal failure. He now shows improved stability of hemodynamics but still requires continued ventilatory support. The patient has been found to have GNR x2 in sputum sample with a mild associated rise in WBC count.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, as indicated by the need for continued ventilatory support. The presence of secretions, elevated WBC count, and potential bacterial growth (GNR x2) in the sputum sample suggest an increased risk of pneumonia or worsening respiratory status.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which indicates chronic kidney failure. The management of renal failure includes continuing dialysis, particularly since there is a significant need for volume removal and electrolyte management due to hypotension.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been reasonably stable, but hypotension is still a concern, especially given the need for CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) across the weekend for volume removal and electrolyte management.

4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: Although not directly mentioned as a current issue, the patient's history of DM, Type II should be considered when assessing glycemic control and managing the patient's nutritional needs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient has several ongoing issues and complications, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, anemia, hypoglycemia, depression, ESRD, CAD, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, right below-knee amputation/prosthetic vascular disease (R BKA/PVD), and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Medical Interventions:
- The patient is currently on ventilator-protected synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) with pressure support (PS) weaned to 7 cm H2O. He is also receiving atrovent nebs and albuterol nebs as needed.
- The patient's tracheostomy tube position has been changed multiple times, and currently, it is left as is.
- Antibiotics have been initiated for pseudomonas and serratia infections.
- The patient's diverting colostomy appears to be improving, and wound care is being continued.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), DM2 (type 2 diabetes), infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs (ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia). The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone several interventions including diverting colostomy, tracheal repositioning, and antibiotic therapy.

The patient's current issues include hypercarbic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypotension, ESRD, s/p diverting colostomy, anemia, hypoglycemia, depression, hypotension, CAD (coronary artery disease), atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, R BKA/PVD (right below-knee amputation/peri-vascular disease), and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (given the presence of pseudomonas and serratia in the sputum), renal failure, cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal bleeding, and further complications related to diabetes and osteomyelitis.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, blood glucose levels, renal function, and cardiovascular parameters. Regular assessment of the patient's mental status and depression symptoms should also be conducted"

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
     # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to
   be improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   -Cont current wound care
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
     # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Most recent bronch showing no granulation tissue at or above trach
   stie, unable to see below.  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal
   stenosis that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make
   the patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now growing
   pseudomonas and serratia. ABG overnight [**1-22**] with slightly worse
   hypercarbia and hypoxia so increased PEEP and inspiratory pressures.
   - Continue ventilator- PS wean as tol
   -Cipro for 14D course for serratia in sputum. Day 1- [**1-22**]
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
    # Leukocytosis:  Down slightly today to 14.8.  Has been afebrile, no
   symptoms of infection except possible PNA as above. Last  hypotensive
   [**1-18**] requiring pressors and ? cardiac vs infectious vs autonomic
   instability
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given

   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs in past.  HD fri [**1-22**] but unable to take off sign

   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Bridge removed by surgery yesterday and stated no evidence of
   surrounding necrosis or cellulitis. Pt at high risk of ostomy pulling
   back into abd.
   - continue ostomy care
    # Anemia: Hct stable at 24 today. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   - continue Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
    # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and
   signs of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily- increased last weekend.
   - Social work following
   -OT consulted for possible other ways to communicate
    # Hypotension- Currently weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and
   free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid. Should recheck as outpt.

     # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, hypotension, and other comorbidities. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone several interventions and procedures.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been experiencing copious, thick secretions, and there is a suspicion of tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis which may impede airflow. This can increase the risk of pneumonia, especially since the sputum cultures have grown pseudomonas and serratia.

2. Wound infection: The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer and has undergone a diverting colostomy. There is a risk of wound infection, especially considering the patient's immunocompromised state due to ESRD and diabetes.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing low blood glucose levels despite having decreased insulin doses. This could be due to poor absorption of tube feeds or a change in the patient's glucose metabolism.

4. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal function, especially if the CVVH (continuous"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing oxygen saturation levels in the 70s and copious, thick secretions. There is suspicion of tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that prevents proper air flow when using a positive pressure valve. The patient's ABG shows worsening hypercarbia and hypoxia.

2. Infected Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer that required a diverting colostomy. The surgical site appears to be healing, but the patient is at high risk of the ostomy pulling back into the abdomen.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection. The source of infection is suspected to be pseudomonas and serratia in the sputum.

4. ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease): The patient is on hemodialysis due to diabetic nephropathy. There is a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of persistent renal failure and respiratory failure. He requires ongoing volume removal and ventilatory support. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has hypotension and is dependent on volume overload. He has a history of multiple medical conditions including hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease, type II diabetes mellitus, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, chronic respiratory failure, and hypertension. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are fluctuating, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring and adjustment of insulin dosage are necessary to maintain stable glycemic control.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which can lead to irregular heart rhythms and potential complications such as stroke or heart failure. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm, along with anticoagulation therapy if indicated, is crucial.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's renal function is severely compromised, resulting in renal failure. This condition requires ongoing dialysis to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances and prevent further complications.
4. Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has uncontrolled DM"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which has been treated with a diverting colostomy. The ulcer seems to be improving, but ongoing wound care and monitoring are necessary.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, and the exact etiology is unclear. Suspected causes include tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis, which may prevent proper airflow when the pressure support valve is in place. Positional changes in the tracheostomy tube have not resolved the issue. Increased PEEP and inspiratory pressures have worsened hypercarbia.
3. Pseudomonas and serratia infection: The patient's sputum is growing pseudomonas and serratia. Antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin for 14 days has been initiated to treat the serratia infection.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is"

   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
     # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to
   be improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   -Cont current wound care
   -Will need plastics follow up this week
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
     # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Pt noted prior to transfer several
   weeks ago to have oxygen sats in the 70s and copious, thick secretions.
   Most recent bronch showing no granulation tissue at or above trach
   stie, unable to see below.  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal
   stenosis that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make
   the patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now growing
   pseudomonas and serratia. ABG overnight [**1-22**] with slightly worse
   hypercarbia and hypoxia so increased PEEP and inspiratory pressures.
   - Continue ventilator- PS wean as tol
   -Cipro for 14D course for serratia in sputum. Day 1- [**1-22**]
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
    # Leukocytosis:  Down slightly today to 16.1.  Has been afebrile, no
   symptoms of infection except possible PNA as above. Last  hypotensive

   instability
   - will trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given
   known osteo (finished meropenem [**1-11**]) stage 4 sacral ulcer.
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-18**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs in past.  HD fri [**1-22**] but unable to take off sign

    # Anemia: Hct stable at 24 today. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   - continue Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
    # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and
   signs of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily- increased last weekend.
   - Social work following
   -OT consulted for possible other ways to communicate
    # Hypotension- Currently weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current problems include:
1. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient had a diverting colostomy on [**1-6**] and is showing improvement. Extensive debridement was performed, and a wound vacuum was placed. The patient will continue with current wound care, and plastics follow-up is scheduled this week.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient had oxygen saturation levels in the 70s and thick secretions prior to transfer. A recent bronchoscopy showed no granulation tissue at or above the tracheostomy site, and tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis may be preventing air flow when the pressure support (PS) valve is in place. The patient's trachea was positioned for ventilation, but the issue could not be identified, so it will be left as is for now. Sputum cultures from [**1-18**] grew"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs.
- The patient underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
- He is currently in the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be caused by muscular weakness, pneumonia, or difficulty with tracheostomy tube positioning.
- The patient's sputum is growing pseudomonas and serratia.
- He has leukocytosis but no symptoms of infection except possible pneumonia.
- The patient is on CVVH due to fluid overload and will continue until the filter runs out, then he will undergo HD tomorrow.
- His diverting colostomy is functioning well, but surgery is concerned about poor wound healing.
- The patient has anemia, but his Hct is stable at 24%.
- He experiences frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, possibly due to poor absorption of tube feeds.
- The patient is showing signs of depression and is being treated with citalopram.
- He has hypotension and has been weaned off Levo.
- The patient has a history of CAD, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, R BKA/PVD, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
     # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Exact etiology of respiratory
   failure unclear.  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that
   doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make the patient
   unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation
   but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple positions
   so will leave as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now growing pseudomonas
   and serratia. On increased PEEP and inspiratory pressures after recent
   ABG showed worsened hypercarbia.
   - Continue ventilator- PS wean as tol
   -Cipro for 14D course for serratia in sputum. Day 1- [**1-22**]

   instability
   -  trend WBC and fever curve, low threshold for starting abx given
   known osteo (finished meropenem [**1-11**]) stage 4 sacral ulcer.

   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Bridge removed by surgery yesterday and stated no evidence of
   surrounding necrosis or cellulitis. Pt at high risk of ostomy pulling
   back into abd.
   - continue ostomy care
    # Anemia: Hct stable at 24 today. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   - continue Lantus to 10u qd

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Exact etiology of respiratory
   failure unclear- may include some muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty
   [**1-18**] body habitus .  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis
   that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make the
   patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now growing
   pseudomonas and serratia. Currently stable on [**4-20**].
   - Continue ventilator- PS wean as tol
   - Cipro for 14D course for serratia in sputum. Day 1- [**1-22**].  Today is
   day 6.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: On CVVH since [**1-22**] in order to remove fluid.   Was hypotensive
   to SBP of 70 during fluid removal yesterday and required small bolus
   with improvement of SBP to 80s.  Initially HD was planned to be started
   on [**2151-1-27**] but low SBP makes this less likely.
   - Continue boluses prn for hypotension
   - No HD today
   - Renal reccs were to decrease volume of tube foods so as to reduce
   volume reduction goals of dialysis but will continue bolusing with goal
   of patient
s SBP being adequate to ultimately tolerate HD
   # Hypotension:  Currently weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and
   free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid. Should recheck as outpt.
   Cortisol [**1-18**] nl at 19.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -consider gentle boluses for hypotension prn
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Bridge removed by surgery last week and stated no evidence of
   surrounding necrosis or cellulitis. Pt at high risk of ostomy pulling
   back into abd.  On [**1-26**],  surgery stated very poor wound healing with
   some skin loss and would rechk nutrition labs. [**Month (only) 60**] need debridement at
   some point but as there is currently no infection and this would leave
   him with a floating ostomy over fascia, will wait for now
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   - Cont current wound care
   - contact Plastics re: need to change wound vac
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 24 today. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   - continue Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   -OT consulted for possible other ways to communicate
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR today 2.5
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient has a complicated medical history, including chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM 2, and multiple infections. He is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) due to renal failure and has a low blood pressure that requires careful fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's exact etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but it may include muscular weakness, pneumonia (PNA), and difficulty with tracheal stenosis or malacia. The patient is currently stable on CPAP/PSV (continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation) and is being weaned off the ventilator.

2. ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease): The patient is on CVVH to remove excess fluid and manage renal failure. He is also planned for hemodialysis (HD) on Wednesday, but his low blood pressure makes this less likely at the moment.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive"

2. Infection: The patient has a history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and is currently growing pseudomonas and serratia in his sputum. There is a risk of further infection and sepsis.
3. ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease): The patient requires ongoing hemodialysis to manage his renal failure. There is a risk of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Diverting Colostomy: The patient had a diverting colostomy performed on [**1-6**]. There is a risk of ostomy pulling back into the abdomen and poor wound healing.

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Exact etiology of respiratory
   failure unclear- may include some muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty
   [**1-18**] body habitus .  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis
   that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make the
   patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now growing
   pseudomonas and serratia. Currently stable on [**4-20**].
   - Continue ventilator- PS wean as tol
   - Cipro for 14D course for serratia in sputum. Day 1- [**1-22**].  Today is
   day 6.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
    # ESRD: On CVVH since [**1-22**] in order to remove fluid.   Was hypotensive
   to SBP of 70 during fluid removal yesterday and required small bolus
   with improvement of SBP to 80s.  Initially HD was planned to be started
   on [**2151-1-27**] but low SBP makes this less likely.
   - Continue boluses prn for hypotension
   - No HD today
   - Renal reccs were to decrease volume of tube foods so as to reduce
   volume reduction goals of dialysis but will continue bolusing with goal
   of patient
s SBP being adequate to ultimately tolerate HD
   # Hypotension:  Currently weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and
   free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid. Should recheck as outpt.
   Cortisol [**1-18**] nl at 19.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -consider gentle boluses for hypotension prn
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Bridge removed by surgery last week and stated no evidence of
   surrounding necrosis or cellulitis. Pt at high risk of ostomy pulling
   back into abd.  On [**1-26**],  surgery stated very poor wound healing with
   some skin loss and would rechk nutrition labs. [**Month (only) 60**] need debridement at
   some point but as there is currently no infection and this would leave
   him with a floating ostomy over fascia, will wait for now
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   - Cont current wound care
   - contact Plastics re: need to change wound vac
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 24 today. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs have noted to be low, 56
   this morning.  Lantus was decreased recently to 10u. Pt
s insulin doses
   have not changed and neither has his tube feed regimen. Hypoglycemia
   may be [**1-18**] poor absorption of tube feeds from bowel wall edema given
   the recent procedure.  Possible that now that patient is no longer
   infected that his hyperglycemia is less and therefore needs less
   insulin
   - continue Lantus to 10u qd
   - continue SSI
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   -OT consulted for possible other ways to communicate
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR today 2.5
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
    # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
    # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), DM2 (type 2 diabetes), infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. 

The patient has several ongoing issues:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The exact etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but it may include muscular weakness, pneumonia, and difficulty with body habitus. There is a suspicion of tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis that prevents adequate airflow when the pressure support (PS) valve is in place. The tracheostomy tube has been left in multiple positions without finding the problem, so it will be left as is for now.
2. ESRD: The patient is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) to remove fluid. He was hypotensive during fluid removal yesterday and required small boluses to improve blood pressure. Initially, hemodialysis (HD) was planned to start on 1/27, but low blood pressure makes this less likely.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been weaned off Levo (presumably a"

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Exact etiology of respiratory
   failure unclear- may include some muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty
   [**1-18**] body habitus .  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis
   that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make the
   patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia. Currently stable on [**4-20**]. Sputum from [**1-26**]
   growing 2 types GNRs
   - Continue ventilator- PS wean as tol
   - Cipro for 14D course for serratia in sputum. Day 1- [**1-22**].  Today is
   day 7.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
    # ESRD: On CVVH [**1-22**]- [**1-27**] in order to remove fluid.   HD reinitiated
   [**1-28**] but without fluid removal [**1-18**] persistently low BP.
   - Continue boluses prn for hypotension.  If SBP <70 and not responsive
   to fluids, would choose Levo as pressor of choice.
   - per renal recs, nutrition changes TF so now getting 50cc/hr not
   70cc/hr
   # Hypotension:  Currently weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and
   free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid. Should recheck as outpt.

   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -consider gentle boluses for hypotension prn
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Bridge removed by surgery last week and stated no evidence of
   surrounding necrosis or cellulitis. Pt at high risk of ostomy pulling
   back into abd.  On [**1-26**],  surgery stated very poor wound healing with
   some skin loss and would rechk nutrition labs. [**Month (only) 60**] need debridement at
   some point but as there is currently no infection and this would leave
   him with a floating ostomy over fascia, will wait for now. Family has
   been told there are no further surgical options. Ostomy may very well
   retract at some point which would be catastrophic likely spilling feces
   into abd.
   -continue ostomy care

   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs were noted to be lower.
   Pt
s insulin doses have not changed. TF changed [**1-28**].  This issue seems
   to have resolved at this time.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily

   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR today 3.9. While pt
   critically ill and undergoing procedures,  coumadin will be deferred as
   risk of anticoagulation greater than benefits.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient has a complicated hospital course with previous ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving 50% FiO2 and has an RSBI of 94. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 93/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a Hct of 22.3%, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's nutritional status is being managed with tube feeds.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and previous episodes of VAP/HAP put him at risk for further respiratory complications.

2. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function, which may lead to further deterioration in kidney function and accumulation of toxins.

3. Hypotension: The patient's persistently low blood pressure indicates a risk of hypoperfusion and potential organ damage"

   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Exact etiology of respiratory
   failure unclear- may include some muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty
   [**1-18**] body habitus .  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis
   that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make the
   patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia. Currently stable on [**4-20**]. Sputum from [**1-26**]
   growing 2 types GNRs
   - Continue ventilator- PS wean as tol
   - Cipro for 14D course for serratia in sputum. Day 1- [**1-22**].  Today is
   day 7.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
    # ESRD: On CVVH [**1-22**]- [**1-27**] in order to remove fluid.   HD reinitiated
   [**1-28**] but without fluid removal [**1-18**] persistently low BP.
   - Continue boluses prn for hypotension.  If SBP <70 and not responsive
   to fluids, would choose Levo as pressor of choice.
   - per renal recs, nutrition changes TF so now getting 50cc/hr not
   70cc/hr
   # Hypotension:  Currently weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and
   free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid. Should recheck as outpt.
   Cortisol [**1-18**] nl at 19.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -consider gentle boluses for hypotension prn
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Bridge removed by surgery last week and stated no evidence of
   surrounding necrosis or cellulitis. Pt at high risk of ostomy pulling
   back into abd.  On [**1-26**],  surgery stated very poor wound healing with
   some skin loss and would rechk nutrition labs. [**Month (only) 60**] need debridement at
   some point but as there is currently no infection and this would leave
   him with a floating ostomy over fascia, will wait for now. Family has
   been told there are no further surgical options. Ostomy may very well
   retract at some point which would be catastrophic likely spilling feces
   into abd.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   - Cont current wound care
   - planned wound vac dressing change with wound care, ICU team and
   plastics [**1-29**]
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
   # Anemia: Hct stable at 24 today. Pt has ESRD and is currently on Epo
   treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - Trend Hct, infusion goal > 21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs were noted to be lower.
   Pt
s insulin doses have not changed. TF changed [**1-28**].  This issue seems
   to have resolved at this time.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   -OT consulted for possible other ways to communicate
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR today 3.9. While pt
   critically ill and undergoing procedures,  coumadin will be deferred as
   risk of anticoagulation greater than benefits.
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
     # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   - finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
     # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently on CVVH for fluid removal.

The patient's current issues include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The exact cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but may involve muscular weakness, pneumonia, and difficulty with tracheal stenosis or malacia. The tracheostomy tube position is currently unchanged.

2. ESRD: The patient is on CVVH to remove fluid, but his blood pressure remains low. He will continue to receive boluses as needed for hypotension. If the systolic blood pressure falls below 70 and is unresponsive to fluids, Levo would be chosen as the pressor of choice.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, but he has been weaned off Levo since 1/18. TSH is elevated, and free T4 is low, but this is likely due to a sick thyroid. It should be rechecked as an outpatient. Midodrine will be continued, and blood pressures and mentation will be monitored. Gentle"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs.
- He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
- The patient's sputum culture grew pseudomonas and serratia.
- He is currently stable on ciprofloxacin for a 14-day course for serratia in sputum.
- The patient has ongoing issues with hypotension, anemia, hypoglycemia, depression, CAD, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, R BKA/PVD, plasma cell dyscrasia, and nutrition.
- His current medications include midodrine, fludrocortisone, atrovent nebs, prn albuterol nebs, ciprofloxacin, epo treatment, citalopram, statin, and PPI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, potentially necessitating mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of pseudomonas and serratia in the sputum culture indicates a high risk of infection. There is a possibility of developing ventilator"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently being treated for serratia pneumonia. The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, ESRD on hemodialysis, and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure could worsen due to his underlying conditions such as obesity, weakness, and sleep apnea. Close monitoring of respiratory status and ongoing management of ventilation support are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Infection: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and is being treated for serratia pneumonia. Infection control measures should be continued to prevent the spread of infection and to ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy. Regular monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is essential.

3. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing management through hemodialysis. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and uremic symptoms is necessary to optimize renal function and prevent complications.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be multifactorial and needs"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including COPD, chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with diverting colostomy, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia episodes. He has been critically ill with hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. The patient underwent wound debridement and is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's history of multiple previous VAP episodes and current mechanical ventilation puts him at risk for developing VAP again.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure readings show fluctuations, indicating potential hemodynamic instability.
3. Infection: Given the patient's infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and previous infections, there is a risk of further infection.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction, which may worsen due to ongoing illness and medication use.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and chronic respiratory failure increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and potential cardiac dysfunction may lead to cardiovascular complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on
   [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and pseudomonas.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Cipro for 10 ourse for serratia in sputum on day 9 currently.
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
     # ESRD: Tolerating HD currently and got yesterday.  BP
s stable.  No
   immediate HD needs today.
   - Continue boluses prn for hypotension.  If SBP <70 and not responsive
   to fluids, would choose Levo as pressor of choice.
   - per renal recs, nutrition changed TF [**1-28**] so now getting 50cc/hr not
   70cc/hr
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound infection
   necrosis on ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH
   elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.   Cortisol
   checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine, flourinef
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -consider gentle boluses for hypotension prn
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed last week and some necrosis around site.  Surgery aware
   and think appearance is not encouraging but few options for
   management.  Family aware there are no further surgical options and
   ostoy may retract into abdomen leading to catastrophic stool
   contamination.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery [**Month/Year (2) 8080**]
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   Debrided again and wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
   # Anemia: Hct back to 23 today.  Will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs were noted to be lower.
   Pt
s insulin doses have not changed. TF changed [**1-28**].  This issue seems
   to have resolved at this time.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  INR subtherapeutic but
   holding coumadin  for the moment given multiple other medications,
   potential for more procedures, and generally poor prognosis.
     # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   -          finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week
   course).
     # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   #Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin SC

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, and diabetes mellitus type II. He has a history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, multiple ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and a complicated hospital course. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's exact etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but it may include muscular weakness, pneumonia, and difficulty tolerating a speaking valve due to tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis.
2. Infection: The patient has grown pseudomonas and serratia from sputum cultures, indicating a possible ongoing infection.
3. ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease): The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to remove excess fluid. His blood pressure has been persistently low, and he has required boluses for hypotension.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, requiring the use of midodrine, fludrocortisone, and levothyroxine to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Diverting Colostomy: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Exact etiology of respiratory
   failure unclear- may include some muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty
   [**1-18**] body habitus .  Suspect some tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis
   that doesn
t allow air flow when PM valve is in place and make the
   patient unable to tolerate the valve.  O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for
   ventilation but  IP here [**1-19**] could not find prob with trach in multiple
   positions so will leave as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia. Currently stable on [**4-20**]. Sputum from [**1-26**]
   growing 3 types GNRs one of which is pseudomonas
   -f/u speciation from [**1-26**] sputum cx
   - Continue ventilator
   - Cipro for 14D course for serratia in sputum. Day 1- [**1-22**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
    # ESRD: On CVVH [**1-22**]- [**1-27**] in order to remove fluid.   HD reinitiated
   [**1-28**] but without fluid removal [**1-18**] persistently low BP.
   - Continue boluses prn for hypotension.  If SBP <70 and not responsive
   to fluids, would choose Levo as pressor of choice.
   - per renal recs, nutrition changed TF [**1-28**] so now getting 50cc/hr not
   70cc/hr
   -HD today
   # Hypotension:  Currently weaned off Levo since [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and
   free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid. Should recheck as outpt.
   Cortisol [**1-18**] nl at 19.
   -continue midodrine, flourinef
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -consider gentle boluses for hypotension prn
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Surgery has signed off. No TTP at site, brown stool and gas in bag.
   Bridge removed by surgery last week and stated no evidence of
   surrounding necrosis or cellulitis. Pt at high risk of ostomy pulling
   back into abd.  On [**1-26**],  surgery stated very poor wound healing with
   some skin loss and would rechk nutrition labs. [**Month (only) 60**] need debridement at
   some point but as there is currently no infection and this would leave
   him with a floating ostomy over fascia, will wait for now. Family has
   been told there are no further surgical options. Ostomy may very well
   retract at some point which would be catastrophic likely spilling feces
   into abd.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery [**Month (only) 8080**]
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   Debrided again and wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
   # Anemia: Hct slightly down at 20  today. Pt has ESRD and is currently
   on Epo treatment, will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   - transfuse 1u PRBCs today
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs were noted to be lower.
   Pt
s insulin doses have not changed. TF changed [**1-28**].  This issue seems
   to have resolved at this time.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression give his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues. INR today 3.9. While pt
   critically ill and undergoing procedures,  coumadin will be deferred as
   risk of anticoagulation greater than benefits.
   - Off nodal agents until BPs can better tolerate.
     # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
   -          finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week
   course).
     # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. He has a history of several medical conditions, including anemia, depression, CAD, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, plasma cell dyscrasia, and prophylaxis for stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to muscular weakness, pneumonia, difficulty with tracheomalacia or tracheal stenosis, and intolerance to speaking valves.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, serratia in sputum, and growth of three types of gram-negative rods (GNRs), including pseudomonas.
3. Hypotension: The patient has persistently low blood pressure, which has responded to fluids but not to vasopressors. He requires close monitoring and may require gentle boluses for hypotension.
4. ESRD: The patient is on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is currently being treated for serratia pneumonia. The patient has a complicated hospital course and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's history of multiple prior VAPs/HAPs increases the risk of developing VAP while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's condition is complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
3. Infection: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and is currently being treated for serratia pneumonia. Infections can worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be multifactorial. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and increase the risk of further complications.
5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD, requiring regular dialysis sessions. Poorly controlled electrolyte imbalances can contribute to further complications and instability.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's critical illness and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of malnutrition, which can impair wound healing"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with diverting colostomy, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation.

The patient is currently being treated for serratia pneumonia, and it is mentioned that the sputum culture likely colonizer will follow respiratory status and treat if decompensates. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 94/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 37.3°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, overweight/obese, normal head, ears, nose, and throat, diminished breath sounds on the right side, soft non-tender abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses on the right side. Neurologic examination shows the patient follows simple commands and responds appropriately.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.3-18.4 thousand/mm³, hematocrit of 20.5-24.5%, platelet count of 144-196"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on
   [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and pseudomonas.
   Thought to be colonized and not active infection although sputum is
   green with low- grade fever. WBC flat.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Cipro for 14D course started [**1-22**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
     # ESRD: Tolerating HD currently and got Sat [**1-30**].  BP
s stable.
   -HD planned today
   - Continue boluses prn for hypotension.  If SBP <70 and not responsive
   to fluids, would choose Levo as pressor of choice.
   - per renal recs, nutrition changed TF [**1-28**] so now getting 50cc/hr not
   70cc/hr
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine, flourinef
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -consider gentle boluses for hypotension prn
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1^st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Surgery aware and think appearance is not encouraging but few
   options for management.  Family aware there are no further surgical
   options and ostomy may retract into abdomen leading to catastrophic
   stool contamination.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   Debrided again and wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
   -Change wound vac again today
   # Anemia: Hct back to 23 today.  Will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   # Hypoglycemia: Since OR procedure pt
s CBGs were noted to be lower.
   Pt
s insulin doses have not changed. TF changed [**1-28**].  This issue seems
   to have resolved at this time.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  INR subtherapeutic but
   holding coumadin  for the moment given multiple other medications,
   potential for more procedures, and generally poor prognosis.
     # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various issues such as hypercarbic respiratory failure, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia episodes.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing low blood sugar levels, likely due to insulin therapy for diabetes.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, but there are no active issues at the moment.
3. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient is tolerating dialysis and has stable blood pressure.
4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient has type II diabetes and is receiving insulin therapy.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, particularly around the coccygeal area where there is a stage IV ulcer.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient is showing signs of depression and decreased interest in his current medical situation.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, possibly due to chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other factors.

The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and now presents with several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure with a tracheostomy, which may contribute to his current condition. He also has COPD and requires ventilatory support.
2. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient has a history of ESRD and is currently tolerating dialysis. His renal function should be closely monitored.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, likely due to multiple factors including chronic wound infection necrosis, other medical conditions, and medications.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and there is a risk of DKA, especially during periods of stress or illness.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and requires ongoing wound care. He also has impaired skin integrity due to his medical conditions.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be attributed to his overall medical condition and medications.

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on
   [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and pseudomonas.
   Thought to be colonized and not active infection although sputum is
   green with low- grade fever. WBC flat.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Cipro for 14D course started [**1-22**].

   - Continue boluses prn for hypotension.  If SBP <70 and not responsive
   to fluids, would choose Levo as pressor of choice.
   - per renal recs, nutrition changed TF [**1-28**] so now getting 50cc/hr not
   70cc/hr
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.

   Bridge removed during 1^st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Surgery aware and think appearance is not encouraging but few
   options for management.  Family aware there are no further surgical
   options and ostomy may retract into abdomen leading to catastrophic
   stool contamination.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   Debrided again and wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain controlled reasonably well with 100 mcg fentanyl patch ,
   lidocaine patches and morphine PRN
   -Change wound vac again today
   # Anemia: Hct back to 23 today.  Will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%

   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  INR subtherapeutic but
   holding coumadin  for the moment given multiple other medications,
   potential for more procedures, and generally poor prognosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a probable multifactorial respiratory failure secondary to muscular weakness, pneumonia (PNA), and difficulty due to body habitus.
2. ESRD: The patient is tolerating hemodialysis (HD) and has stable blood pressure. HD is planned today, and the patient should continue with boluses as needed for hypotension. If the systolic blood pressure is below 70 mmHg and not responsive to fluids, Levo pressor would be chosen.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely multifactorial, including chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues. The patient was weaned off Levo since January 18th, but midodrine and fludrocortisone should be continued. Blood pressures and mentation should be monitored, and gentle boluses for hypotension should be given as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation (Afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with diverting colostomy, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonias/hospital-acquired pneumonias (VAPs/HAPs).
- The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation.
- The patient is currently being treated for Serratia pneumonia.
- The patient's condition is critical, and he requires intensive care unit (ICU) care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of multiple VAPs, which can be a complication associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing complications such as respiratory acidosis and subsequent organ dysfunction.
3. Serratia pneumonia: The patient is currently being treated for Serratia pneumonia, indicating an active infection that can lead to worsening respiratory status and systemic complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be multifactorial and requires close monitoring and management to ensure adequate tissue perfusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with diverting colostomy, multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, OSA (obstructive sleep apnea), body habitus, and weakness. This condition requires immediate attention and treatment.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of multiple VAPs and is currently being treated for Serratia pneumonia. Close monitoring of sputum production and color is necessary to detect any changes.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is multifactorial. Stable at the moment, it needs to be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis for ESRD. Regular monitoring of renal function and compliance with dialysis sessions is essential.
5. Infected Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coc"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with diverting colostomy, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. The patient is currently being treated for Serratia pneumonia and is receiving ceftazidime for 10 days, finishing the ciprofloxacin course, and being weaned off the tracheostomy tube as tolerated.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of multiple prior VAPs, which increases the risk of developing further respiratory infections while on mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's obesity, weakness, and oversedation may contribute to inadequate ventilation and carbon dioxide retention.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which can be multifactorial and may require further evaluation and management.

4. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for Serratia pneumonia and has a history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer. There is a risk of developing new infections or complications related to the existing infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with a diverting colostomy, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. The patient is currently being treated for serration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which may contribute to hypercarbic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is essential.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of multiple VAPs. Continuous monitoring of sputum culture and adherence to proper ventilation practices are crucial to prevent VAP.
3. Infection: The patient is infected with serration pneumonia, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be continued. Regular assessment of vital signs and monitoring of laboratory parameters are necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient has multifactorial hypotension. Frequent monitoring of blood pressure and prompt intervention if hypotension recurs are important.
5. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis. Regular monitoring of renal function and adherence to dialysis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with a diverting colostomy, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient was transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. He is currently being treated for serration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to factors such as OSA, body habitus, and weakness. It is crucial to closely monitor his respiratory function and provide appropriate support.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has had multiple episodes of VAP in the past. Since he is currently being treated for serration pneumonia, it is important to monitor his sputum culture results and ensure adequate antibiotic therapy.
3. Hypotension: The patient has stable hypotension, which may be multifactorial. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis for ESRD. Regular monitoring of renal function and adherence to dialysis schedule are essential to manage his condition effectively.
5. Infected Stage IV Coccy"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on
   [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and pseudomonas.   We are
   currently treating this as the patient has low grade fever and
   leukocytosis.  WBC flat.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: More hypotensive and seems slightly less responsive this
   morning than previously.  Will discuss with nephrology re: plausible or
   indicated to continue HD when consistently required to give back
   volume.  Possible this is no longer indicated.
   -d/w feasibility of continued dialysis with nephrology
   -no emergent HD needs
   -no indication for CVVH as not a transitional theory to anything
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine, fludracortisone stopped after nephrology indicated
   cannot work w/ no renal function
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -consider gentle boluses for hypotension prn
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Surgery aware and think appearance is not encouraging but few
   options for management.  Family aware there are no further surgical
   options and ostomy may retract into abdomen leading to catastrophic
   stool contamination.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Seems to be
   improving. Plastics debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.
   Debrided again and wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain not ideally controlled with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine
   patches and morphine PRN
   # Anemia: Hct back to 23 today.  Will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in
   200
s-300
s.  Will increase glargine from 10-15 units QAM.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  INR subtherapeutic but
   holding coumadin  for the moment given multiple other medications,
   potential for more procedures, and generally poor prognosis.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
          -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   #Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin SC
   #Code: Full for moment
   #Ethics: Nursing and Housestaff with major concerns about futility and
   benefit of further procedures and intentions in this patient given poor
   functional status and fact that further pressors worsen wound
   dehiscence and breakdown, may consider pursuing hospital policy
   regarding futile care and CPR not indicated (will discuss w/ ethics and
   attending)
   #Disposition: ICU, case mgmt on board re ultimate placement.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, anemia, hyperglycemia, depression, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, right below-knee amputation/prosthetic vascular disease (R BKA/PVD), plasma cell dyscrasia, and various other medical issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and previous VAP/HAP suggests a high risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient is at increased risk for developing new infections due to his compromised immune system, tracheostomy, and infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure and the need for vasopressor support indicate a risk of hypotension, which may compromise organ perfusion.

4. Wound dehiscence: The patient's history of wound breakdown and retraction of the diverting colostomy raises concerns about potential wound dehiscence.

5. Further cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and atrial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a history of muscular weakness, PNA, and difficulty due to body habitus. The patient has been colonized with pseudomonas and serratia, and there is a low-grade fever with green sputum. He is currently on ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure with a tracheostomy and COPD. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration due to underlying lung disease and possible infections.
2. Infection: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and has been colonized with pseudomonas and serratia. There is a risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia or worsening of the current infection.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on dialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which may be multifactorial due to chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues. There is a risk of shock and inadequate organ perfusion.
5. Diverting Colostomy: The patient had a diverting colostomy, but there was necrosis around the site. There is a risk of complications related to the ostomy, such as retraction into the abdomen leading to catastrophic stool contamination.
6. Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which is improving with wound care and diverting colostomy. However, there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the ulcer.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and there is a need for ongoing monitoring and transfusion as required.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia, which resolved after changing the total parenteral nutrition (TF) formula. There is a need for continued monitoring of blood glucose levels.
9. Depression: The patient shows signs of depression due to his current medical situation. There is a need for appropriate management and support.
10. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has coronary artery disease with a dilated LV cavity. There is a risk of cardiac ischemia or other cardiac events.
11. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and there is a risk of thromboembolic events if not adequately anticoagulated.
12. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of osteomyelitis, and there is a risk of recurrence or complications related to the infection.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with a diverting colostomy. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. He is currently being treated for a serratia pneumonia and has a sputum culture positive for Pseudomonas. The patient is on hemodialysis and has multifactorial hypotension, which is stable at present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Serratia Pneumonia: The patient has a sputum culture positive for serratia, indicating an active infection. This may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Pseudomonas Infection: The presence of Pseudomonas in the sputum culture suggests a potential infection. This can be concerning as Pseudomonas is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections and can be difficult to treat.
3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to oversedation and obesity hypoventilation. If not properly managed, this condition may lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis treatment. Complications such as fluid overload"

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with a diverting colostomy, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonias/hospital-acquired pneumonias. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. The patient is currently being treated for a Serratia pneumonia and is on mechanical ventilation. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 337 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 31 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 101 mmHg. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 92 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 88/44 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, a non-tender abdomen, and an ostomy that is necrotic. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.7 K/uL, an elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 2.3 mg/dL, hypoalbuminemia with an albumin level of 1.5 g/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.6 mmol/L. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium (K+) level of 3.1 mEq/L. The patient's medical team has discussed the futility of certain treatments such as vasopressors and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and has decided to focus on comfort care. The family is aware and agrees with this decision.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's history of multiple previous VAPs, there is a risk of developing another episode of pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Wound infection: The patient's necrotic ostomy raises concerns about wound infection and potential spread to deeper structures.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating a risk of inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function, which could worsen due to factors such as hypotension or sepsis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory disease"

 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team yesterday, family
   is aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options.
   We will not be going any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors. We will be continuing current abx, HD and other tx.  Pt is
   DNR. We will be treating his pain regardless of hypotension.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on
   [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and pseudomonas.   We are
   currently treating this as the patient has low grade fever and
   leukocytosis.  WBC flat.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: More hypotensive and seems slightly less responsive over the
   last several days.
   -Continuing dialysis as long as tolerated.
   -HD today with no fluid being taken off.
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Surgery aware and think appearance is not encouraging but few
   options for management.  Family aware there are no further surgical
   options and ostomy may retract into abdomen leading to catastrophic
   stool contamination.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
   # Anemia: Hct back to 22 today.  Will not further transfuse.
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in
   200
s-300
s.  Will increase glargine from 10-15 units QAM.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB [**1-18**] hypotension
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  INR subtherapeutic but
   holding coumadin  for the moment given multiple other medications,
   potential for more procedures, and generally poor prognosis.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
          -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   #Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin SC
   #Disposition: ICU, case mgmt on board re ultimate placement.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and a history of multiple ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) episodes. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had persistent low blood glucose levels, so it is important to monitor and manage his glucose levels closely.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, but no active issues are currently present. The INR is subtherapeutic, and the use of coumadin is being held due to multiple medications and potential procedures.

3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on dialysis and continues to be hypotensive. Dialysis will be continued as long as tolerated, with no fluid being taken off during hemodialysis (HD) today.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, possibly due to chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues. Pressors are no longer indicated, and the patient is being monitored for blood pressure, mentation, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP), and a complicated hospital course. The patient underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and may be due to muscular weakness, pneumonia, and difficulty ventilating due to his body habitus.
2. ESRD: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to hypotension and potential fluid imbalances. There is a discussion regarding the feasibility of continued dialysis with nephrology.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is multifactorial, possibly related to chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues. He has been weaned off Levo and is on midodrine and fludrocortisone for management.
4. S/P Diverting Colostomy: The patient had a diverting colostomy, which was performed to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. There is concern about the"

 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team yesterday, family
   is aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options.
   We will not be going any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors. We will be continuing current abx, HD and other tx.  Pt is
   DNR. We will be treating his pain regardless of hypotension.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on
   [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and pseudomonas.   We are
   currently treating this as the patient has low grade fever and
   leukocytosis.  WBC flat.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: More hypotensive and seems slightly less responsive over the
   last several days.
   -Continuing dialysis as long as tolerated.
   -HD today with no fluid being taken off.
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Surgery aware and think appearance is not encouraging but few
   options for management.  Family aware there are no further surgical
   options and ostomy may retract into abdomen leading to catastrophic
   stool contamination.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
   # Anemia: Hct back to 23 today.  Will keep transfusion goal Hct >21%
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in
   200
s-300
s.  Will increase glargine from 10-15 units QAM.
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until BPs tolerate.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  INR subtherapeutic but
   holding coumadin  for the moment given multiple other medications,
   potential for more procedures, and generally poor prognosis.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
          -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
   #Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin SC
   #Code: Full for moment
   #Ethics: Nursing and Housestaff with major concerns about futility and
   benefit of further procedures and intentions in this patient given poor
   functional status and fact that further pressors worsen wound
   dehiscence and breakdown, may consider pursuing hospital policy
   regarding futile care and CPR not indicated (will discuss w/ ethics and

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options, and the family has agreed to a do not resuscitate (DNR) order. The goals of care include providing pain relief, treating infections, and maintaining comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure could progress, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen, resulting in a decline in renal function and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Infections: The patient has persistent infections, including pseudomonas and serratia, which can lead to sepsis and systemic inflammation.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers and wound infections.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may deteriorate, leading to delirium or confusion.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
7. Diabetes Complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II may lead to complications such as hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He was transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. The patient is currently being treated for Serratia and Pseudomonal pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of oversedation/obesity hypoventilation leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition can worsen if not properly managed.
2. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis due to ESRD. It is important to monitor kidney function and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be multifactorial. Close monitoring and appropriate intervention are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
4. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has decubitus ulcers, which require regular turning, pain management, and proper wound care to prevent further complications.
5. Ostomy Complications: The patient has a necrotic ostomy site with spillage of bowel contents into the subcutaneous space. Proper management of the ostomy site is crucial to prevent infection and other complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonias/hospital-acquired pneumonias. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. He is currently being treated for serratio and Pseudomonas infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's history suggests a likelihood of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by factors such as oversedation, obesity, and weakness.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonias/Hospital-Acquired Pneumonias: The patient has a history of multiple VAPs/HAPs, indicating an increased risk for further infections while on mechanical ventilation.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis due to ESRD. This condition requires careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
4. Infected Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer that requires proper wound management to prevent further complications.
5. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient's immobilization and critical condition may lead to the development of pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers.
6. Ostomy Complications: The patient's necrotic ostomy site with spillage of bowel contents into the subcutaneous space may result in additional complications.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be multifactorial and requires careful monitoring and management to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

The patient's critical illness and complex medical history pose significant risks for various medical complications. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to address these potential complications and provide appropriate care."

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors. We will be continuing current abx, HD and other tx.  Pt is
   DNR. We will be treating his pain regardless of hypotension.  Per
   nephrology on [**2-4**], will try dialysis on [**2-5**] but stop if SBP < 70. If
   this happens and pt is determined to no longer be able to tolerate HD,
   will need to have another family mtg re: goals of care.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on
   [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and pseudomonas.   We are
   currently treating this as the patient has low grade fever and
   leukocytosis.  WBC flat.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: More hypotensive and seems slightly less responsive over the
   last several days.
   -Continuing dialysis as long as tolerated.
   -HD planned tomorrow as long as SBP>70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.

   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Surgery aware and think appearance is not encouraging but few
   options for management.  Family aware there are no further surgical
   options and ostomy may retract into abdomen leading to catastrophic
   stool contamination.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. The patient's goals of care include pain management, continuing current antibiotics, hemodialysis, and other treatments, while being DNR. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure. This could lead to further respiratory compromise and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential shock.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and is on dialysis. There is a risk of further renal deterioration or complications related to dialysis, such as hypotension during the procedure.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity with a stage IV coccygeal ulcer. This increases the risk of infection and potential sepsis.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be due to various factors including his medical conditions, medications, or complications"

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team yesterday, family
   is aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options.
   We will not be going any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors. We will be continuing current abx, HD and other tx.  Pt is
   DNR. We will be treating his pain regardless of hypotension.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has a history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP), and a complicated hospital course. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping - This may be due to the patient's chronic medical conditions and the stress of multiple hospital admissions.
2. Hypoglycemia - The patient has persistently high blood glucose levels, which can lead to hypoglycemia if insulin is administered.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) - The patient has a history of AFIB, which may be exacerbated by his current medical situation.
4. Renal failure, end stage (ESRD) - The patient already has ESRD, and his condition may worsen due to various factors.
5. Diabetes mellitus type II - The patient's diabetes may be poorly controlled, leading to hyperglycemia.
6. Impaired skin integrity - The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, which can lead to further skin breakdown and infection.
7. Altered mental status - The patient has shown signs of depression and decreased interest in his current medical situation, indicating altered mental status.
8. Respiratory failure, chronic - The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory complications.
9. Hypotension - The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to multiple factors, including chronic wound infection and other issues.
10. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - The patient's coccygeal ulcer is infected and requires ongoing wound care management.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important for the healthcare team to monitor and manage these conditions closely to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 M with COPD and chr resp failure s/p trach, Afib, ESRD on HD,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer s/p diverting colostomy [**1-6**] to aid
   in coccygeal wound healing, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course transferred [**12-24**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation.  We
   have now reached the limits of our options.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Likely [**1-18**] OSA/body
   habitus/weakness.  Currently being treated for serratia and pseudomonal
   PNAs.
   - Sputum culture with Psuedomonas with increased sputum
   production/change in color to green.
   - Ceftaz x 10 days
   - Finish Cipro course
   - PS/TC as tolerated
   # ESRD: On HD if tolerated.  No plans for CVVHD per no escalation of
   care discussion with family.
   - HD today, and if SBP drops below 70, then renal with terminally stop
   HD and inform family
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial
 stable now.  Follow.  No pressors.
   #Decubitus ulcers: Pain meds as needed for comfort given painful
   dressing changes.
   #Ostomy: Necrotic ostomy site with spillage of bowel contents into
   subcutaneous space tracking to peritoneum.
   All other issues per resident note.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by
   pressors and we will treat pain as needed.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on
   [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and pseudomonas.   We are
   currently treating this as the patient has low grade fever and
   leukocytosis.  WBC flat.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
    # ESRD: Patient was extremely hypotensive this morning but improved to
   SBP
s of 80
s to 90
s later and he is currently receiving HD.  He will
   continue to receive HD but this will be terminated if SBP<70.
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
    # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Surgery aware and think appearance is not encouraging but few
   options for management.  Family aware there are no further surgical
   options and ostomy may retract into abdomen leading to catastrophic
   stool contamination.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
    # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
    # Anemia: Hct back to 22 yesterdat.  Transfusion no longer indicated.
    # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in
   200
s-300
s.  On glargine plus ISS. .
    # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and
   signs of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
    # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB [**1-18**] hypotension
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  INR subtherapeutic but
   holding coumadin  for the moment given multiple other medications,
   potential for more procedures, and generally poor prognosis.
    # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
          -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
    # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's goals of care include pain management, continuing dialysis as tolerated, and treating hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's current medical conditions include anemia, hyperglycemia, depression, CAD with a TTE showing EF 50-55%, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, R BKA/PVD, plasma cell dyscrasia, and prophylaxis for PPI and heparin SC.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has probable multifactorial respiratory failure secondary to muscular weakness, pneumonia, and difficulty due to body habitus. The tracheostomy position may need to be adjusted, and the patient is currently being treated for pseudomonas and serratia infections.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely multifactorial, including chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues. The patient was weaned off Levo since 1/18, and midodrine"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors. We will be continuing current abx, HD and other tx.  Pt is
   DNR. We will be treating his pain regardless of hypotension.  Per
   nephrology on [**2-4**], will try dialysis on [**2-5**] but stop if SBP < 70. If
   this happens and pt is determined to no longer be able to tolerate HD,
   will need to have another family mtg re: goals of care.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Probable multifactorial respiratory
   failure secondary to muscular weakness, PNA and difficulty due to body
   habitus.   O/n [**1-17**] trach positional for ventilation but IP here [**1-19**]
   could not find problem with trach in multiple positions so will leave
   as is for now. Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas and serratia and on
   [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and pseudomonas.   We are
   currently treating this as the patient has low grade fever and
   leukocytosis.  WBC flat.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
    # ESRD: More hypotensive and seems slightly less responsive over the
   last several days.
   -Continuing dialysis as long as tolerated.
   -HD planned tomorrow as long as SBP>70
    # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
    # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Surgery aware and think appearance is not encouraging but few
   options for management.  Family aware there are no further surgical
   options and ostomy may retract into abdomen leading to catastrophic
   stool contamination.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
    # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
    # Anemia: Hct back to 22 yesterdat.  Transfusion no longer indicated.
    # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in
   200
s-300
s.  On glargine plus ISS. .
    # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and
   signs of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
    # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB [**1-18**] hypotension
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  INR subtherapeutic but
   holding coumadin  for the moment given multiple other medications,
   potential for more procedures, and generally poor prognosis.
    # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
          -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
    # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
    #Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin SC

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications and conditions. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and has high carbon dioxide levels in their blood. This can be due to muscular weakness, pneumonia, and body habitus.

2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD, which is a chronic lung disease that can worsen over time and cause breathing difficulties.

3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD, indicating severe kidney dysfunction. This condition requires dialysis to manage waste products and electrolyte imbalances.

4. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, which may lead to complications such as hyperglycemia. Proper management of blood sugar levels is essential to prevent further complications.

5. Infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer: The patient has an infected coccygeal ulcer that has led to the need for a diverting colostomy. This condition requires careful wound care and management to prevent further complications.

6. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can be multifactorial in nature. It may be due to chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other underlying issues.

7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. This could be caused by chronic disease or blood loss"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with diverting colostomy, multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. The patient has been treated for serration and Pseudomonas pneumonia and is currently on hemodialysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for continued respiratory failure due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and a history of multiple ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. ESRD on HD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis support. There is a concern for fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which can be multifactorial and may require further evaluation and management.
4. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has stage IV coccygeal ulcers with spillage of bowel contents into the subcutaneous space. This increases the risk of infection and wound complications.
5. Ostomy Complications: The patient has a necrotic ostomy site with spillage of bowel contents. This may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD), an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with a diverting colostomy, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. He is currently being treated for serration and Pseudomonas pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which can lead to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition is characterized by increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood due to inadequate ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of multiple VAP episodes. VAP is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. It is caused by bacterial infections acquired during the time spent in the ICU.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can be multifactorial. It needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
4. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient has painful dressing changes due to necrotic ostomy sites. This indicates the presence of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/31 to 97/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 320-369 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient has scattered crackles bilaterally on pulmonary examination and is tracheostomized. He has an ostomy in place and shows signs of chronic wound infection. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. He also has low platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolyte imbalances.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last
   evalutation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.   We are currently treating this as the
   patient had low grade fever and persistent leukocytosis.
   - Continue [**4-20**]
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
    # ESRD: Patient had HD w/o fluid removal yesterday and his pressures
   managed to tolerated.  Schedule is HD on MWF until unable to tolerated
   due to SBPS in 70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
    # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
    # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
    # Anemia: Hct stable yesterday, not checked today.  Tx no longer
   indicated.
    # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in

s.  On glargine plus ISS. .
    # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and
   signs of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
    # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB [**1-18**] hypotension
    # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  Not anticoagulated given
   generally morbid prognosis.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
          -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).

The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone diverting colostomy for coccygeal ulcer healing.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/31 mmHg to 97/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of a low-grade fever and persistent leukocytosis. The patient is unable to provide history due to the presence of a speaking valve.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose levels, and slightly elevated platelet count. Other lab values such as potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, and liver enzymes are within normal limits. The patient's thyroid function tests indicate an elevated TSH level and low free T4 level, suggesting sick euthyroid syndrome.

   - Sputum culture with Psuedomonas with increased sputum
   production/change in color to green.
   - Ceftaz x 10 days
   - PS/TC as tolerated
   # ESRD:
   - Cont HD as tolerated (maint SBP >70)
   - No plans for CVVHD per no escalation of care discussion with family.
   # Hypotension:
   - Multifactorial

   - No pressors if status worsens.
   # Afib
   - off anticoag sec risk/benefit analysis
    #Decubitus ulcers:
   - Pain meds as needed for comfort given painful dressing changes.
    #Ostomy:
   - Necrotic ostomy site with spillage of bowel contents into
   subcutaneous space tracking to peritoneum.
   - Based on poor underlying status, no real options to address
    All other issues per resident note.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, diverting colostomy, multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

The patient is currently being treated for serration and pseudomonal positive nosocomial pneumonia. Sputum culture shows an increase in pseudomonas production. He is on ceftazidime for 10 days and receiving pulmonary toilette as tolerated.

The patient has end-stage renal disease and is undergoing continuous hemodialysis. There are no plans for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis per family discussion.

The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and there are no plans for vasopressor use if his condition worsens.

The patient has atrial fibrillation and is off anticoagulation due to a risk-benefit analysis.

The patient has decubitus ulcers and is receiving pain medications as needed for comfort during dressing changes.

The patient also has a necrotic ostomy site with spillage of bowel contents into the subcutaneous space, tracking to the peritoneum. Given the patient's poor underlying status, there are no real options to address this issue.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he has a history of multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. There is an increased risk of further respiratory deterioration.

2. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for serration and pseudomonal positive nosocomial pneumonia. There is a risk of progression or development of new infections due to his immunocompromised state and indwelling medical devices.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.

4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal function, fluid overload, and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for arrhythmias and potential cardiac complications.

6. Pressure ulcers: The patient has decubitus ulcers, which can worsen and lead to deeper tissue damage and potential infections.

7. Ostomy complications: The patient's necrotic ostomy site with spillage of bowel contents into the subcutaneous space indicates a potential risk of further infection and complications related to the ostomy site.

8. Overall poor prognosis: The patient's poor underlying health status and complex medical history suggest a high risk of mortality and morbidity."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer. The patient underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of the coccygeal ulcer. 

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is presumed to be multifactorial and related to weakness, pneumonia, and obesity/hypoventilation. His sputum culture has grown pseudomonas and serratia. He is currently being treated with ceftazidime for a 10-day course. 

The patient also has ESRD and is scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday until he can no longer tolerate it due to systolic blood pressure pulsus paradoxus (SBPS). 

His hypotension is most likely multifactorial, including chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues. He was weaned off Levo since January 18th. 

The patient had a diverting colostomy on January 6th, but the bridge was removed during the first week of [Month 1088], and some necrosis around the site occurred. The site is failing, and there are no further surgical options available. If the site collapses into the abdomen, it may lead to massive stool contamination and sepsis. 

The patient's stage IV coccygeal ulcer has been debrided extensively and placed in a wound vacuum. 

Other medical conditions include anemia, hyperglycemia, depression, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), osteomyelitis, rheumatic fever, plasma cell dyscrasia, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing ostomy care, pain control with fentanyl patch, lidocaine patches, and morphine PRN, and monitoring blood pressures and mentation. 

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and previous ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and has undergone various treatments without success. The patient currently presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is presumed to be multifactorial. He also has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and a diverting colostomy performed to facilitate healing. The patient's medical team has decided against further surgery, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), blood transfusions, pressors, or new antibiotics. The goals of care include pain management, treating hypercarbic respiratory failure, and managing other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and hypercarbic respiratory failure put him at risk for further deterioration in lung function, leading to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and previous VAP indicate a risk for ongoing infections, particularly in the presence of impaired skin integrity and prolonged hospitalization.

   76 M with COPD and chr resp failure s/p trach, Afib, ESRD on HD,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer s/p diverting colostomy [**1-6**] to aid
   in coccygeal wound healing, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course transferred [**12-24**] for hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   - Likely [**1-18**] OSA/body habitus/weaknes
   - Currently being treated for serratia and pseudomonal PNAs.
   - Sputum culture with Psuedomonas with increased sputum
   production/change in color to green.
   - Ceftaz x 10 days
   - PS/TC as tolerated
   # ESRD:
   - Cont HD as tolerated (maint SBP >70) next session scheduled for
   tomorrow.
   - No plans for CVVHD if can
t tolerate HD per no escalation of care
   discussion with family.
   # Hypotension:
   - Multifactorial
 stable currently.
   - No pressors if status worsens.
   # Afib

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer post-diverting colostomy, multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonias/hospital-acquired pneumonias, and a complicated hospital course. He was transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. The patient is currently being treated for serration and pseudomonal pneumonia. His sputum culture shows increased production and change in color to green. He is receiving ceftazidime for 10 days and PS/TC as tolerated. He requires continuous hemodialysis (CHD) as tolerated, with the next session scheduled for tomorrow. There are no plans for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) if he cannot tolerate HD per no escalation of care discussion with the family. He is experiencing hypotension, which is multifactorial and stable at the moment. If his condition worsens, no pressors will be used. He also has atrial fibrillation and is off anticoagulation due to a risk-benefit analysis. Additionally, he has decubitus ulcers and is receiving pain medication for comfort during dressing changes. His ostomy site is necrotic with spillage of bowel contents into the subcutaneous space tracking to the peritoneum"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last
   evalutation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.   We are currently treating this as the
   patient had low grade fever and persistent leukocytosis.
   - Continue [**4-20**]- today increased to [**9-20**] as pt was tachypneic
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: Patient had HD w/o fluid removal [**2-5**] and his pressures managed
   to tolerated.  Schedule is HD on MWF until unable to tolerated due to
   SBPS in 70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
   -At nursing
s request, will d/w wound care schedule of wound vac
   dressing. See if this could be twice rather than thrice weekly and
   preferably on weekdays
   # Anemia: Hct stable yesterday, not checked today.  Tx no longer
   indicated.
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in
   200
s-300
s.  On glargine plus ISS. .
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin , off BB [**1-18**] hypotension
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  Not anticoagulated given
   generally morbid prognosis.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
    -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
    # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
    # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.
    #Prophylaxis: PPI, heparin SC
   # Disposition: ICU, case mgmt on board re ultimate placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), DM 2 (type 2 diabetes), infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs (ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia). He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient has been experiencing a fever of 101.8°F and has shown signs of tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated leukocyte count. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 358 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.4 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 102 to 222 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia.

The patient's assessment and plan include goals of care, management of hypercarbic respiratory failure, ESRD, hypotension, stage IV coccygeal ulcer, anemia, hyperglycemia, depression, CAD (coronary artery disease), atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, plasma cell dyscrasia, and prophylaxis measures. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, bronchodilators, and analgesics.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy and COPD puts him at risk for further respiratory failure, especially considering his current hypercarbic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and pH levels will be essential.

2. Infection: Given the patient's history of infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer and recurrent VAPs/HAPs, there is a risk of ongoing or new infections. Regular assessment of vital signs, leukocyte count, and culture results will help identify any infection promptly.

3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's ESRD requires careful management of fluid balance and electrolyte levels. Monitoring renal function through serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be due to multiple factors such as chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, or other underlying causes. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with medications like midodrine and pressors will be necessary.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's persistently elevated blood glucose levels require careful monitoring and management to prevent complications related to hyperglycemia.

6. Depression: The patient's decreased interest and signs of depression should be addressed with appropriate mental health support.

7. Cardiovascular Disease: The patient's history of CAD and dilated left ventricular cavity on TTE indicates a risk for cardiac complications. Regular monitoring of cardiac enzymes and symptoms of ischemia will be important.

8. Osteomyelitis: Although currently not active, the patient's history of osteomyelitis needs ongoing monitoring for any signs of recurrence.

9. Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: The patient's known IgA kappa monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) requires regular follow-up and monitoring for any progression to multiple myeloma or related complications.

10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's stage IV coccygeal ulcer and diverting colostomy put him at risk for developing or exacerbating pressure ulcers. Proper skin care and frequent repositioning are essential to prevent further skin breakdown.

These are just some of the potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. Close monitoring and appropriate management will be crucial in preventing or minimizing these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last
   evalutation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.   We are currently treating this as the
   patient had low grade fever and persistent leukocytosis.
   - Continue [**4-20**]- today increased to [**9-20**] as pt was tachypneic
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: Patient had HD w/o fluid removal [**2-5**] and his pressures managed
   to tolerated.  Schedule is HD on MWF until unable to tolerated due to
   SBPS in 70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
   -At nursing
s request, will d/w wound care schedule of wound vac
   dressing. See if this could be twice rather than thrice weekly and
   preferably on weekdays
   # Anemia: Hct stable yesterday, not checked today.  Tx no longer
   indicated.
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in
   200
s-300
s.  On glargine plus ISS. .
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin , off BB [**1-18**] hypotension
   # Atrial Fibrillation: No active issues.  Not anticoagulated given
   generally morbid prognosis.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
    -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
    # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
    # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation (Afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with diverting colostomy, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and is currently being treated for serration and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and his current condition is likely due to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. He is being treated with ceftazidime for serratia and Pseudomonas pneumonia and is also receiving physiotherapy as tolerated.
2. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is undergoing continuous hemodialysis (CHD) as tolerated. There are no plans for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) if the patient cannot tolerate CHD per the family's discussion.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing multifactorial hypotension, which is currently stable."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with a diverting colostomy, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. The patient is currently being treated for serratiopeptidase and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. He has several medical complications including hypotension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis, pressure ulcers, and a necrotic ostomy site with spillage of bowel contents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is infected with serratiopeptidase and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function if not adequately supported.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be multifactorial in origin. If not appropriately managed, it could lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction or shock.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of clot formation and"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last
   evalutation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.   We are currently treating this as the
   patient had low grade fever and persistent leukocytosis.
   - Continue pressure support
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].  Today is day [**7-26**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: Patient had HD w/o fluid removal [**2-5**] and his pressures managed
   to tolerate.  Schedule is HD on MWF until unable to tolerate due to
   SBPS in 70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation

   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
   -At nursing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He has been transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 84/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 376 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance and resistance index (RSBI) is 95, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 15 cmH2O, and the spontaneous respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 6.4 g/dL, platelet count of 186 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 22.9 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL, glucose level of 94 mg/dL, sodium level of 141 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride level of 106 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.3 mg/dL, and calcium level of 7.9 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is presumed to have multifactorial hypercarbic respiratory failure related to weakness, pneumonia (PNA), and obesity/hypoventilation syndrome. The sputum cultures have grown pseudomonas and serratia, and the patient is being treated with ceftazidime for 10 days.
2. ESRD: The patient had hemodialysis (HD) without fluid removal and his pressures were managed to tolerate. He will continue with HD on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays until he is unable to tolerate due to suspected stage 2 acute kidney injury (SBPS) in the setting of severe sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial with chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues. He has been weaned off Levo since January 18th, and his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was elevated while free T4 was low on January 18th. However, this is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and recently underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options, and the family has been informed of this. The goals of care include treating pain as needed, continuing hemodialysis as tolerated, and managing hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including weakness, pneumonia, and obesity/hypoventilation. There is a concern about the position of the tracheostomy tube, but the last evaluation suggested it is not the cause. The patient's sputum has grown pseudomonas and serratia, and he is currently being treated with ceftazidime. The patient's tachypnea has worsened, and the respiratory support should be closely monitored.

2. ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease): The patient has ESRD and requires hemodialysis. His blood pressures were managed during the most recent session, and he will continue with hemodialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays until he can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history including COPD, chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with diverting colostomy, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia episodes. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. He is currently being treated for serration and pseudomonal peritoneal nail infections. The patient has a variety of ongoing medical issues, including ESRD requiring continued hemodialysis, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, pressure ulcers, and an ostomy with spillage of bowel contents into the subcutaneous space.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's obesity, weakness, and oversedation may contribute to hypercarbic respiratory failure. It is important to optimize respiratory support and consider interventions such as non-invasive ventilation or tracheostomy placement.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing infections, including serration and pseudomonal peritoneal nail infections. Close monitoring of culture results and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial. Source control measures should also be implemented as necessary.
3. ESRD: The patient requires continued hemodialysis to manage his end-stage renal disease. Frequent monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a complex medical history, including COPD, chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer with diverting colostomy, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely related to oversedation/obesity hypoventilation. He is currently being treated for Serratia and Pseudomonal peritoneal neutrophil counts.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated with ceftazidime for 10 days and is advised to perform pulmonary toilette as tolerated.
2. ESRD: The patient will continue with maintenance hemodialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. There are no plans for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis if the patient tolerates regular hemodialysis, according to family discussion.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial but currently stable. No vasopressors will be used if the patient's condition worsens.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is off anticoagulation due to a risk-benefit analysis.

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last
   evalutation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.   We are currently treating this as the
   patient had low grade fever and persistent leukocytosis.

   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].  Today is day [**7-26**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: Patient had HD w/o fluid removal [**2-5**] and his pressures managed
   to tolerate.  Schedule is HD on MWF until unable to tolerate due to
   SBPS in 70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation, which may contribute to his hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Pseudomonas and Serratia Infection: The patient's sputum grew pseudomonas and serratia, indicating a possible infection.
3. ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease): The patient has ESRD and requires hemodialysis (HD) three times a week.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, including chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues.
5. Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has a stage IV coccygeal ulcer that has not healed despite treatment, including diverting colostomy.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are stable but may require further evaluation and treatment.

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequently underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current medical conditions include ineffective coping, hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), renal failure (end stage), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), respiratory failure (chronic), and hypotension (not in shock).

The patient's goals of care have been discussed with the family, and it has been determined that no further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions, pressors, or new antibiotics will be administered. The patient will continue with hemodialysis as tolerated, and pain will be managed as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including weakness, pneumonia, and obesity/hypoventilation. There is a concern about the position of the tracheostomy tube, but recent evaluations suggest that it is not the cause of the respiratory failure. The patient's sputum culture has shown growth of pseudomonas and serratia, and"

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last
   evalutation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.   We are currently treating this as the
   patient had low grade fever and persistent leukocytosis.
   - Continue pressure support
   - Ceftazidime for 10D course started [**2-2**].  Today is day [**8-26**].
   - Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   # ESRD: Patient had HD w/o fluid removal today  and his pressures
   managed to tolerate.  Schedule is HD on MWF until unable to tolerate
   due to SBPS in 70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care incl wound vac changes MWF
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
   # Anemia: Hct down to 20 today.  Tx no longer indicated.
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypertension. He has been admitted to the ICU with a fever, hypotension, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options, and the goals of care include pain management, hemodialysis as tolerated, and withholding further interventions such as blood transfusions, pressors, and new antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has weak respiratory effort due to obesity, pneumonia, and possibly tracheostomy-related issues.
2. ESRD: The patient requires regular hemodialysis to manage renal failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other factors.
4. Stage IV Coccygeal Ulcer: The patient has an infected and non-healing coccygeal ulcer that requires ongoing wound care.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, but further treatment is not indicated.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has persistently high blood glucose levels despite insulin therapy.
7. Depression: The patient shows signs of depression due to his current medical situation.
8. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation,"

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last evaluation
   suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas
   and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and
   pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of treatment for this
   second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   -          Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   -          Day 10 of ceftazidime therapy, stopped today
   #Altered MS: Presumably due to persistent hypotension and morbid
   status.  Monitor for signs of distress
   # ESRD: Patient had HD w/o fluid removal today  and his pressures
   managed to tolerate.  Schedule is HD on MWF until unable to tolerate
   due to SBPS in 70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care incl wound vac changes MWF
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with tachycardia yesterday presumably
   due to persistent infection/hypotension.  No indication for
   pharmacologic reversal and patient has now reversed on his own.  Not
   anticoagulated given generally morbid prognosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and has since been evaluated for various medical conditions including altered mental status, anemia, hyperglycemia, depression, CAD, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, right below-knee amputation/prosthetic vascular disease, plasma cell dyscrasia, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate potential complications related to breathing, such as hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis.
2. Infection: The presence of an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, previous VAPs/HAPs, and recent growth of pseudomonas and serratia in sputum cultures suggest the risk of infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, and wound infection.
3. Anemia: With a Hct down to 20, the patient is at risk of developing complications related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased tissue perfusion.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's persistently high blood glucose levels indicate the risk of complications associated with diabetes, such as ketoacidosis,"

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last evaluation
   suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas
   and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and
   pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of treatment for this
   second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   -          Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   -          Day 10 of ceftazidime therapy, stopped today
   #Altered MS: Presumably due to persistent hypotension and morbid
   status.  Monitor for signs of distress
   # ESRD: Patient had HD w/o fluid removal today  and his pressures
   managed to tolerate.  Schedule is HD on MWF until unable to tolerate
   due to SBPS in 70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again and
   wound vac replaced [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care incl wound vac changes MWF
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.

   due to persistent infection/hypotension.  No indication for
   pharmacologic reversal and patient has now reversed on his own.  Not

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic health conditions including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has a history of infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current issue is hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is presumed to be multifactorial due to weakness, pneumonia, and obesity/hypoventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. His oxygen saturation is normal at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, using a tracheostomy tube. His blood gases show respiratory acidosis with elevated carbon dioxide levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, tracheostomy, clear breath sounds, and diminished peripheral pulses. He has absent lower extremity pulses bilaterally and cyanotic left foot with missing toes. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Neurological examination shows response to verbal stimuli but no movement or assessment of tone.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient has impaired glucose control and electrolyte imbalances. His thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, diabetes mellitus type 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient's current goals of care include comfort measures, pain management, and no further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions, pressors, or new antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including weakness, pneumonia, and obesity/hypoventilation. Continued pressure support with Atrovent nebs and PRN albuterol nebs is recommended.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient may have altered mental status due to persistent hypotension and morbid status. Monitoring for signs of distress is advised.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has increased leukocytosis, which could be due to infection sources such as the chronic ulcer, degrading ostomy, and PICC site. No further antibiotics are indicated.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient requires hemodialysis (HD) today if tolerated and stable blood pressure"

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last evaluation
   suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas
   and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and
   pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of treatment for this
   second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   -          Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   -          10 days of ceftazidime completed, will not initiate any
   further antibiotic therapies
   #Altered MS: Presumably due to persistent hypotension and morbid
   status.  Monitor for signs of distress
   #Leukocytosis: Patient with increased leukocytosis from [**9-3**] over the
   past two days.  He completed a course of 10 days of ceftazidime for his
   last respiratory isolates but given poor respiratory mechanics, no
   cough, unlikely to ever fully clear respiratory pathogens.  Also
   possible infection sources in chronic ulcer, degrading ostomy, and PICC
   site.  No further abx indicated.
   # ESRD: HD today if patient can tolerate and SBP

   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since

   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone multiple interventions without improvement. The patient's current goals of care include pain management, continued hemodialysis as tolerated, and treatment of hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and multiple medical issues may contribute to psychological distress and ineffective coping mechanisms.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's persistent hyperglycemia and use of insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's tachycardia and history of infection/hypotension may predispose him to AFIB.
4. Renal failure, end stage (ESRD): The patient's pre-existing ESRD requires ongoing management and may be exacerbated by his current condition.
5. Diabetes mellitus (DM) type II: The patient's persistent hyperglycemia indicates poor glycemic control and requires ongoing monitoring and management.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's stage IV coccygeal ulcer and failing diverting colostomy site put him at risk for further skin breakdown and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) episodes. The patient has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, ineffective coping, hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), renal failure (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), hypotension (not shock), and depression. 

The patient has undergone various interventions and treatments, including diverting colostomy, wound care for a stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and management of other comorbidities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's weakenss, pneumonia, and obesity/hypoventilation may contribute to this condition.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues may lead to further complications.
3. Hypotension: Multifactorial causes such as chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues contribute to this condition.
4. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing dial"

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last evaluation
   suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas
   and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and
   pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of treatment for this
   second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   -          Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   -          10 days of ceftazidime completed, will not initiate any
   further antibiotic therapies
   #Altered MS: Presumably due to persistent hypotension and morbid
   status.  Monitor for signs of distress
   #Leukocytosis: Patient with increased leukocytosis from [**9-3**] over the
   past two days.  He completed a course of 10 days of ceftazidime for his
   last respiratory isolates but given poor respiratory mechanics, no
   cough, unlikely to ever fully clear respiratory pathogens.  Also
   possible infection sources in chronic ulcer, degrading ostomy, and PICC
   site.  No further abx indicated.
   # ESRD: HD today if patient can tolerate and SBP
s >70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.

   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again [**1-29**].

   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine IV PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.

   We will continue to make his comfort our primary goal of care and
   nephrology colleagues will advise regarding role for any further HD as
   hemodyanmics can allow.
   His wounds have progressed and he does have pain with dressing changes.
   We will use narcotic analgesia as needed for comfort.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, renal failure (ESRD), and chronic respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 71/30 mmHg to 88/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's weight is 118.9 kg, with a fluid balance of +1401 mL (+658 mL in) and -321 mL out. 

The patient's physical examination reveals poor air movement in the chest, soft abdomen, and right above-knee amputation. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, low magnesium, and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include ineffective coping, hypoglycemia, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease, type II diabetes mellitus, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), chronic respiratory failure, and hypotension (not in shock).

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.
     # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about position nature to trach in the past but last evaluation
   suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew pseudomonas
   and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with providencia and
   pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of treatment for this
   second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   -          Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   -          10 days of ceftazidime completed, will not initiate any
   further antibiotic therapies
   #Altered MS: Presumably due to persistent hypotension and morbid
   status.  Monitor for signs of distress
    #Leukocytosis: Patient with increased leukocytosis from [**9-3**] over the
   past two days.  He completed a course of 10 days of ceftazidime for his
   last respiratory isolates but given poor respiratory mechanics, no
   cough, unlikely to ever fully clear respiratory pathogens.  Also

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with multiple chronic conditions, including chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and a diverting colostomy. The patient's recent hospital course has been complicated by infections, including pseudomonas and serratia, for which he completed a 10-day course of ceftazidime. He is currently on pressure support, atrovent nebs, and albuterol nebs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping - The patient's complex medical history and current condition may lead to ineffective coping mechanisms.
2. Hypoglycemia - The patient's persistent hyperglycemia may result in hypoglycemic episodes, especially with the use of insulin.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) - The patient has a history of AFIB, which can increase the risk of complications such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Renal failure, end stage (ESRD) - The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis and management of associated complications like anemia.
5. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II - The patient's DM requires careful monitoring of blood glucose levels and management of hyperglycemic episodes.
6. Impaired skin integrity - The patient's impaired skin integrity,"

   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.    In light of  fact that pt may be
   ready to wean from vent and inability to tolerate any UFV take off HD,
   needs another family mtg early this week.
     # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about positional nature to trach in the past but last
   evaluation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of
   treatment for this second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   for now- per resp may be ready to try a trach mask

   -          10 days of ceftazidime completed, will not initiate any

    #Leukocytosis: Patient with increased leukocytosis from [**9-3**] over the
   past two blood draws.  He completed a course of 10 days of ceftazidime
   for his last respiratory isolates but given poor respiratory mechanics,
   no cough, unlikely to ever fully clear respiratory pathogens.  Also
   possible infectious sources in chronic ulcer, degrading ostomy, and
   PICC site.  No further abx indicated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and now has a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient's medical team has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options, and the family is aware that no further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions, pressors, or new antibiotics will be done. The patient's goals of care include pain management and comfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to his underlying chronic condition and obesity/hypoventilation.
2. Ineffective Coping: The patient's depression and decreased interest in life may contribute to ineffective coping with his current medical situation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's chronic wound infection, retracting ostomy, and other issues may lead to persistent hypotension.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's increased leukocyte count may indicate an ongoing infection, despite completing a course of antibiotics.
5. End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient's renal function is compromised, requiring ongoing hemodialysis.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
    # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.    In light of  fact that pt may be
   ready to wean from vent and inability to tolerate any UFV take off HD,
   needs another family mtg early this week.
     # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about positional nature to trach in the past but last
   evaluation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of
   treatment for this second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   for now- per resp may be ready to try a trach mask
   -          Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   -          10 days of ceftazidime completed, will not initiate any
   further antibiotic therapies
   #Altered MS: Presumably due to persistent hypotension and morbid
   status.  Monitor for signs of distress
    #Leukocytosis: Patient with increased leukocytosis from [**9-3**] over the
   past two blood draws.  He completed a course of 10 days of ceftazidime
   for his last respiratory isolates but given poor respiratory mechanics,
   no cough, unlikely to ever fully clear respiratory pathogens.  Also
   possible infectious sources in chronic ulcer, degrading ostomy, and
   PICC site.  No further abx indicated.
   # ESRD: HD tomorrow if patient can tolerate and SBP
s >70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care incl wound vac changes MWF
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine IV PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
   # Anemia: Hct down to 18 yesterday.   No longer getting Epo with HD per
   renal.  Transfusion no longer indicated.
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in
   200
s-300
s.  On glargine plus ISS. .
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity
   -Continue statin , off BB [**1-18**] hypotension
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with tachycardia two days ago presumably
   due to persistent infection/hypotension.  No indication for
   pharmacologic reversal and patient has now reversed on his own.  Not
   anticoagulated given generally morbid prognosis.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
    -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.    In light of  fact that pt may be
   ready to wean from vent and inability to tolerate any UFV take off HD,
   needs another family mtg early this week.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about positional nature to trach in the past but last
   evaluation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of
   treatment for this second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   for now- per resp may be ready to try a trach mask
   -          Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   -          10 days of ceftazidime completed, will not initiate any
   further antibiotic therapies
   # Altered MS: Presumably due to persistent hypotension and morbid
   status.  Monitor for signs of distress
   #Leukocytosis: Patient with increased leukocytosis from [**9-3**] over the
   past two blood draws.  He completed a course of 10 days of ceftazidime
   for his last respiratory isolates but given poor respiratory mechanics,
   no cough, unlikely to ever fully clear respiratory pathogens.  Also
   possible infectious sources in chronic ulcer, degrading ostomy, and
   PICC site.  No further abx indicated.
   # ESRD: HD tomorrow if patient can tolerate and SBP
s >70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation
   -pressors no longer indicated. Not bolusing with fluids
   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool
   contamination and sepsis.
   -continue ostomy care
   -f/u surgery reccs
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer: s/p  diverting colostomy [**1-6**]. Plastics
   debrided extensively [**1-20**] and placed wound vac.  Debrided again [**1-29**].
   - Cont current wound care incl wound vac changes MWF
   - Pain control with 100 mcg fentanyl patch , lidocaine patches and
   morphine IV PRN. Nursing aware that we are now treating all pain with
   morphine PRN and not holding off on treating pain for low BP.
   # Anemia: Hct down to 18 yesterday.   No longer getting Epo with HD per
   renal.  Transfusion no longer indicated.
   # Hyperglycemia: Patient persistently hyperglycemic with BG
s in
   200
s-300
s.  On glargine plus ISS. .
   # Depression: The patient has been showing decreased interest and signs
   of depression given his current medical situation
   - Cont citalopram 30 mg daily
   - Social work following
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity
   -Continue statin , off BB [**1-18**] hypotension
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient with tachycardia two days ago presumably
   due to persistent infection/hypotension.  No indication for
   pharmacologic reversal and patient has now reversed on his own.  Not
   anticoagulated given generally morbid prognosis.
   # Osteomyelitis:  No active issues
    -finished meropenem ([**1-11**] was the completion of 6 week course).
   # R BKA/PVD
   - Continue current wound care
   # Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: Known IgA kappa on electrophoresis. Bone
   Marrow with 5-10% plasma cells. ?MGUS. Known retroperitoneal mass s/p
   non-diagnostic FNA and needle core biopsy indicating lymphoid tissue
   with quiescent germinal centers.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and had undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's recent events include bleeding from the ostomy site, hyperkalemia, and altered mental status. The plan is to continue pressure support, atrovent nebs, and prn albuterol nebs. The patient completed a 10-day course of ceftazidime and will not initiate any further antibiotic therapies. 

The patient has several ongoing issues such as ESRD, hypotension, s/p diverting colostomy, stage IV coccygeal ulcer, anemia, hyperglycemia, depression, CAD, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, R BKA/PVD, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (due to the presence of pseudomonas and serratia in previous cultures), bleeding from the ostomy site, electrolyte imbalances (particularly hyperkalemia), further deterioration of renal function, complications related to the diverting colostomy (such as site failure and"

   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.    In light of  fact that pt may be
   ready to wean from vent and inability to tolerate any UFV take off HD,
   needs another family mtg early this week.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about positional nature to trach in the past but last
   evaluation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of
   treatment for this second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   for now- per resp may be ready to try a trach mask
   -          Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   -          10 days of ceftazidime completed, will not initiate any
   further antibiotic therapies
   # Altered MS: Presumably due to persistent hypotension and morbid
   status.  Monitor for signs of distress
   #Leukocytosis: Patient with increased leukocytosis from [**9-3**] over the
   past two blood draws.  He completed a course of 10 days of ceftazidime
   for his last respiratory isolates but given poor respiratory mechanics,
   no cough, unlikely to ever fully clear respiratory pathogens.  Also
   possible infectious sources in chronic ulcer, degrading ostomy, and
   PICC site.  No further abx indicated.
   # ESRD: HD tomorrow if patient can tolerate and SBP
s >70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.

   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient's condition is critically ill, and he has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. The family has been informed that no further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions, pressors, or new antibiotics will be provided. The goals of care are focused on comfort measures, pain management, and allowing the patient to pass away peacefully.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is presumed to be multifactorial, related to weakness, pneumonia (PNA), and obesity/hypoventilation. Continuous pressure support may be continued, and the possibility of trying a tracheostomy mask may be considered.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to persistent hypotension and morbid obesity. Monitoring for signs of distress is important.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to ongoing infections, including respiratory pathogens, the chronic ulcer, degrading ostomy, and PICC site."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now was transferred again to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p diverting colostomy to
   allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.
   # Goals of care:  After family meeting with ICU team [**2-2**], family is
   aware that pt has exhausted medical and surgical treatment options. We
   will not be doing any further surgery, CVVH, blood transfusions,
   pressors.  No new antibiotics.  HD will continue as tolerated by BP
   and we will treat pain as needed.  These goals reassessed and
   reaffirmed on [**2151-2-4**] w/ ethics.    In light of  fact that pt may be
   ready to wean from vent and inability to tolerate any UFV take off HD,
   needs another family mtg early this week.
    # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:  Presumably multifactorial and
   related to weakenss, PNA, and obesity/hypoventilation.  There has been
   question about positional nature to trach in the past but last
   evaluation suggested this is not the case.  Sputum from [**1-18**] now grew
   pseudomonas and serratia and on [**9-25**] no longer serratia but with
   providencia and pseudomonas.  He now completed a ten day course of
   treatment for this second set of cultures. Continue pressure support
   for now- per resp may be ready to try a trach mask
   -          Atrovent nebs and prn albuterol nebs
   -          10 days of ceftazidime completed, will not initiate any
   further antibiotic therapies
   # Altered MS: Presumably due to persistent hypotension and morbid
   status.  Monitor for signs of distress
   #Leukocytosis: Patient with increased leukocytosis from [**9-3**] over the
   past two blood draws.  He completed a course of 10 days of ceftazidime
   for his last respiratory isolates but given poor respiratory mechanics,
   no cough, unlikely to ever fully clear respiratory pathogens.  Also
   possible infectious sources in chronic ulcer, degrading ostomy, and
   PICC site.  No further abx indicated.
   # ESRD: HD tomorrow if patient can tolerate and SBP
s >70
   # Hypotension:  Most likely multifactorial with chronic wound
   infection, retracting ostomy and other issues.  Weaned off Levo since
   [**1-18**]. TSH elevated and free T4 low [**1-18**] but likely sick thyroid.
   Cortisol checked and normal.
   -continue midodrine
   -monitor BPs, mentation

   # S/P Diverting Colostomy: Patient had diverting colostomy on [**1-6**].
   Bridge removed during 1st week of [**Month (only) 1088**] and some necrosis around
   site.  Site is failing but no options for further surgery.  If
   collapses into abdomen will most likely lead to massive stool

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM 2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has undergone a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient has experienced several significant events in the past few days, including bleeding from the ostomy site, hyperkalemia requiring treatment, and an elevated temperature indicating possible infection. His potassium levels were elevated at 6.9, which prompted the administration of insulin and dextrose to bring it down. He also has leukocytosis, likely due to ongoing infections.

The patient's current goals of care have been discussed with his family, and it has been determined that no further aggressive interventions will be pursued. The focus will be on comfort measures, including pain management, and maintaining his current level of ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of infected ulcers, ostomy site issues, and previous infections, there is a high risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and hypercarbic respiratory failure put him at risk for continued respiratory compromise, leading to further deterioration in his lung function and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer. The patient has experienced various complications and is now at an advanced stage of his illness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including weakness, pneumonia, and obesity/hypoventilation syndrome. Continuous pressure support is being provided, and the possibility of transitioning to a tracheostomy mask may be considered.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has persistent hypotension and morbid obesity, which could contribute to his altered mental status. Monitoring for signs of distress is important.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an ongoing infection. However, no further antibiotic therapy is indicated as the patient has completed a course of ceftazidime.
4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease, but there are no plans for additional hemodialysis.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, including chronic wound infection, retracting ost"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient has been on several medications including morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and various other ICU medications. He has also been receiving treatment with antibiotics, specifically a 10-day course of ceftazidime.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 99.3°C, heart rate 81 bpm, blood pressure 76/39 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. He is on CPAP/PSV with a set volume of 550 mL, pressure support of 10 cmH2O, respiratory rate set at 20, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 50%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. His blood glucose levels have been consistently high. Other lab results indicate abnormalities in electrolyte levels, liver function tests, and kidney function.

The patient's medical conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, leukocytosis, end-stage renal disease, hypotension, stage IV coccygeal ulcer, anemia, hyperglycemia, depression, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis, and plasma cell dyscrasia.

The patient has undergone several procedures including a diverting colostomy and debridement of a wound. He has also had a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient's goals of care have been discussed with the family, and it has been decided not to pursue further surgical interventions, continuous renal replacement therapy, blood transfusions, or new antibiotic treatments. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (due to the presence of pseudomonas and serratia in his sputum cultures), hypotension, non-healing of the coccygeal ulcer, anemia, hyperglycemia, depression, and possible cardiac events due to coronary artery disease."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer. The patient has had multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs) and healthcare-associated pneumonias (HAPs) with a complicated hospital course. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent a diverting colostomy to allow for healing of his coccygeal ulcer.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 98°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72/31 to 88/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is hemodynamically unstable and is not tolerating hemodialysis (HD). The goals of care have been discussed with the family, and they have decided to make the patient nil by mouth (NPO) and discontinue HD due to the patient's unstable blood pressure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further episodes of VAP/HAP, worsening renal function, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and poor glycemic control. The patient's nutritional status is also a concern, as nutrition has been stopped. Additionally, the patient's pain and nausea need to be managed effectively."
