","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of low urine output overnight, ranging from 20-50ml/hr. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) increased from 1.1 to 1.6, and there are concerns about the accuracy of the CVP reading. The patient received a 250ml bolus at 5am. 

The patient's propofol infusion was attempted to be weaned overnight, but when decreased to 5mcg/kg/min, the patient's respiratory rate increased to 40s and pulling at the line occurred, leading to the increase in propofol back to 10mcg/kg/min.

The patient has multiple allergies, including sulfasalazine, and is currently on various antibiotics, infusions, and other medications. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the low urine output noted above. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8C (100F), current temperature of 36.1C (96.9F), heart rate of 91 (82-106) bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/70-142/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 (16-29) breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of low urine output (UOP) and increased creatinine (Cr). The patient's UOP has been consistently low, ranging from 20-50ml/hr, similar to her UOP in the CCU. The Cr has increased from 1.1 to 1.6. The CVP is unclear, ranging in the low 20s. The patient received a 250ml bolus at 5am.

The patient attempted to wean down on propofol overnight but experienced an increase in respiratory rate (RR) up to 40s, pulling at the line, so propofol was increased back to 10mcg/kg/min.

The patient is on multiple infusions, including propofol and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. She is also receiving various antibiotics.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, with a temperature of 37.8C, heart rate (HR) between 82-106 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 106/70 to 142/95 mmHg, RR between 16-29 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,581 mL, with 740 mL given through the PO, 560 mL through TF, 1,121 mL through IVF, and a total output of 917 mL, including 368 mL of blood products. Urine output has been low at 277 mL.

Respiratory support shows the patient on CMV/ASSIST mode, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, set RR of 12, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and an RSBI of 128. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 31, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 194.

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's intubation. Lab results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), increased creatinine (Cr), and various other abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT/AST), kidney function tests (TCO2), and cardiac markers (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T). Other lab results are also abnormal.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's ICU care includes nutrition through a pulmonary formula, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is on full code status and disposition is pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 44 yo F with PMHx sig. for asthma admitted with
   NSTEMI, course complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure (thought to
   be due to multifocal pneumonia), with multiple hypodense areas on brain
   CT concerning for embolic events, who is still spiking despite broad
   antibiotic coverage
   #Hypoxic respiratory failure: The pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 422**]
   with presumed pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation.
   Per sister, pt has a chronic cough c/w chronic bronchitis.  She was
   noted to be febrile at OSH and here.  AFP negative x 3, respiratory
   precautions discontinued. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. CXR improved.
    -continue standing and PRN nebs
    -continue broad antimicrobial coverage with vanc, aztreonam, doxy,
   caspo
    -appreciate ID input
    -f/u micro date
    -started on steroids IV [**7-30**] for bronchospasm
   - will attempt to wean sedation, wean vent w/ daily wakeups and SBT
   # Fevers: Unknown etiology, currently the only positive mirco data is
   yeast in sputum and urine. On vanco, caspo, aztreonam, doxy. Fever
   curve trending down.
   Possible that this represents either rheumatic or infectious process.
   Pattern of embolic phenomena very suggestive of infectious
   endocarditis, however, would expect blood cultures and or TTE to be
   positive. Possible that this represents fastidiuos organism, but would
   expect fevers to come down w/ broad spectrum ABx. Possible vasculitis
   w/ cerebral involvement. CrAg negative, lyme negative, toxo negative
   for acute infxn. Fungal blood Cx negative. RUQ U/S negative for hepatic
   abscess. Blood parasite smear negative.  Leukocytosis worsening today,
   but steroids added 2 days ago. IUD removed [**7-30**] by Ob/GYN
   -Continue broad antimicroibial coverage with Vancomycin, aztreonam,
   doxycycline and caspofungin.
   -Appreciate ID and rheum input.
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
   -f/u cultures and serologies; resend urine and sputum today
   -Ethic consult pending regarding HIV testing.
   #. ARF: pt with bump in Cr overnight. Urine output remains low despite
   250cc IVF bolus x 2.
   -resend urine lytes
   -continue to hold ace-i
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   #NSTEMI: S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.
   [**Name14 (STitle) 427**] aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up as above
   #Altered mental status: CT and MRI concerning for embolic stroke vs
   septic emboli.  Pt not currently stable enough to attempt TEE; would
   not likely change management at present.   Pt with L arm and head
   movement overnight with weaning of sedation which is encouraging.
   Still not following commands.
   -continue to lighten sedation as tolerated
   -follow neuron exam, mental status
   -Appreciate neuro input
   #Transaminitis: thought to be [**12-29**] ZOsyn. RUQ U/S unremarkable.
   Improving.
   -continue to monitor.
   -avoid Tylenol and other hepatotoxins
   # Hyperglycemia- exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   # ETOH use: no evidence of chronic liver disease.
   -Continue MVI/Thiamine/FOlate.
   -No s/sx of withdrawal, s/p several days of midazolam drip
likely past

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a significant past medical history of asthma and a recent admission for NSTEMI. She was treated for presumed pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and has shown multiple hypodense areas on brain CT, concerning for embolic events.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was admitted with presumed pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation. She is still experiencing respiratory failure despite broad antibiotic coverage.

2. Fevers: The patient has fevers of unknown etiology. The only positive microbiological data is yeast in sputum and urine. She is currently on vancomycin, caspofungin, aztreonam, and doxycycline. Her fever curve is trending down.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has a bump in creatinine overnight. Her urine output remains low despite receiving a 250cc IVF bolus twice.

4. NSTEMI: The patient had a myocardial infarction on admission, with a blocked distal RCA. She was treated with stenting and is currently on aspirin and clopidogrel.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's CT and MRI scans show changes consistent with embolic stroke or septic emboli. She is not currently stable enough to undergo transesophageal"

   endocarditis, however, would expect blood cultures and or TTE to be
   positive. Possible that this represents fastidiuos organism, but would
   expect fevers to come down w/ broad spectrum ABx. Possible vasculitis
   w/ cerebral involvement. CrAg negative, lyme negative, toxo negative
   for acute infxn. Fungal blood Cx negative. RUQ U/S negative for hepatic
   abscess. Blood parasite smear negative.  Leukocytosis worsening today,

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a significant history of asthma admitted to the ICU with presumed pneumonia and an exacerbation of asthma. She required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has multiple hypodense areas on brain CT concerning for embolic events and is still spiking fevers despite broad antibiotic coverage.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 106/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. The patient's C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are elevated, and there are signs of infection with yeast present in sputum and urine cultures.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures are pending, and there is no evidence of endocarditis or hepatic abscess. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, aztreonam, doxycycline, and caspofungin.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated overnight with an increase in creatinine levels and low urine output. There is concern for acute renal failure (ARF) possibly due to embolic phenomena. The patient's mental status is altered with concerns for embolic stroke or septic emboli. She is minimally responsive and able to move"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient admitted with respiratory failure, presumed pneumonia, and asthma exacerbation.
- Intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- Fever, leukocytosis, and positive yeast in sputum and urine despite broad antibiotic coverage.
- Hypoxic respiratory failure persists.
- CT and MRI showing areas of hypodensity in the brain, concerning for embolic events.
- History of NSTEMI with inferior wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram.
- Low urine output and increased creatinine.
- Altered mental status, minimal movement in left arm, and non-responsive to commands.
- Current medications include propofol, heparin, lansoprazole, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and risk factors such as recent surgery increase the risk of DVT.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has low urine output and increased creatinine, indicating possible AKI.
4. Stroke: The presence of hypodense areas on brain imaging raises concern for embolic events, potentially leading to stroke.
5. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient's overbreathing on the ventilator may result in respiratory alkalosis.
6. Hepatic injury: The patient has transam"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, fevers, and altered mental status. She was admitted with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and has been experiencing persistent fevers, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, and her respiratory status is being monitored closely. She is also receiving sedation with propofol, steroids, and multiple antibiotics including antifungals. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse but is currently not in withdrawal. Her renal function has deteriorated, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels. Imaging studies show a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, which is unchanged, and minimal right upper lobe infiltrate improving. Blood cultures from the central line are negative, while sputum cultures show yeast. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is expected to stay in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and she is currently on mechanical ventilation. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary to assess her readiness for extubation. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma should be closely monitored for.
2. Fevers: Despite the improvement in fever curve, it is unclear whether this is due to the change of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of myocardial infarction (MI) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to bronchospasm and altered mental status. The patient's respiratory failure is not fully explained by her chest X-ray, which shows a retrocardiac opacity and minimal right upper lobe infiltrate. Her laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs), kidney dysfunction, and positive yeast in sputum cultures.

The patient has been treated with various medications including propofol, heparin, steroids, antibiotics, and antifungals. Her condition is complicated by fevers, altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia. She has a history of ethanol abuse but is currently beyond the withdrawal window.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 112/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is around 15 mmHg with poor waveform, indicating possible fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to bronchospasm and altered mental status. She continues to have respiratory alkalosis, which may be caused by a CNS process. She will"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications include:

1. Worsening acute renal failure (ARF) with a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of 0.2, indicating intrinsic renal damage.
2. Inadequate response to fluid challenge or diuretic administration, suggesting possible prerenal or intrinsic renal pathology.
3. Sedation weaned, but the patient became dyssynchronous with the ventilator, indicating potential respiratory muscle weakness or fatigue.
4. Limited movement in the right arm, no movement in the right leg, and absence of following commands or tracking, suggesting neurological involvement or paralysis.
5. Presence of multiple comorbidities, including potential sepsis indicated by elevated white blood cell count, elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and positive findings on blood cultures.
6. Impaired pulmonary function, as evidenced by elevated respiratory system resistance index (RSBI), low respiratory rate set on the ventilator, and low tidal volume, indicating possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications.
7. Abnormal vital signs, including fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea, which may indicate systemic infection or sepsis.
8. Abnormal laboratory results, including elevated creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate, D-d"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 44 yo F with PMHx sig. for asthma admitted with
   NSTEMI, course complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure (thought to
   be due to multifocal pneumonia), with multiple hypodense areas on brain
   CT concerning for embolic events, who is still spiking despite broad
   antibiotic coverage
   #Hypoxic respiratory failure: The pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 422**]
   with presumed pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation.
   Per sister, pt has a chronic cough c/w chronic bronchitis.  She was
   noted to be febrile at OSH and here.  AFP negative x 3, respiratory
   precautions discontinued. PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. CXR improved.
    -continue standing and PRN nebs
    -continue broad antimicrobial coverage with vanc, aztreonam, doxy,
   caspo
   -adjust aztreonam and vanco dose for renal function
    -appreciate ID input
    -f/u micro date
    -started on steroids IV [**7-30**] for bronchospasm
   - will attempt to wean sedation, wean vent w/ daily wakeups and SBT
   # Fevers: Unknown etiology, currently the only positive mirco data is
   yeast in sputum and urine. On vanco, caspo, aztreonam, doxy. Fever
   curve trending down (Tmax 100), but pt still w/ profuse diaphoresis.
   Leukocytosis worsening today, but steroids added 2 days ago which may
   explain increasing WBC and decreased steroids.
   -Continue broad antimicroibial coverage with Vancomycin, aztreonam,
   doxycycline and caspofungin.
   -Appreciate ID and rheum input.
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
   -f/u cultures and serologies; resend urine and sputum today
   -Ethic consult pending regarding HIV testing.
   #. ARF: pt with bump in Cr overnight. Urine output remains low despite
   250cc IVF bolus  and then 500cc bolus2.  She was 1.6 L positive
   yesterday, per flow sheet, but has massive insensible losses with
   diaphoresis.
   -bolus 1 L NS now
   -resend urine lytes
   -continue to hold ace-i
   -PM lytes
   -consider renal US (?embolic)
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds (vanc, aztreonam
   adjusted)
   #Respiratoty Alkalosis: likely [**12-29**] to inc. minute
   ventilation. Overbreathing the vent.
   -utilize adequate sedation to decrease resp drive as pt not ready for
   extubation (will wake up again tomorrow AM)
   -repeat ABG this PM
   #Altered mental status: CT and MRI concerning for embolic stroke vs
   septic emboli.  Pt not currently stable enough to attempt TEE; would
   not likely change management at present.   Pt with minimal L arm and
   head movement overnight with weaning of sedation which is
   encouraging.   Still not following commands.
   -continue to lighten sedation as tolerated
   -follow neuro exam, mental status
   -Appreciate neuro input
   #NSTEMI: S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.
   [**Name14 (STitle) 427**] aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up as above
   #Transaminitis: thought to be [**12-29**] ZOsyn. RUQ U/S unremarkable.
   Improving.
   -continue to monitor.
   -avoid Tylenol and other hepatotoxins
   # Hyperglycemia- exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   # ETOH use: no evidence of chronic liver disease.
   -Continue MVI/Thiamine/Folate.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, emobolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, emboli (though no clear embolic source).
   1.  Respiratory failure secondary to resolving pneumonia and
   bronchospasm.   Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 422**] with
   multifocal pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation.
   AFB negative x 3 and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly and patient is requiring only FIo2 of 40, however has
   persistent respiratory alkalosis.  Not currently wheezing after three
   days of steroids (d1 [**7-30**]).
    -continue standing and PRN nebs
    -continue broad antimicrobial coverage with aztreonam, doxy, caspo
   (will d/c vanco due to renal failure)
   - renally dose vanco
    -appreciate ID input
    -f/u micro data
    -titrate down steroids given lack of wheezing on exam for 48 hours
   .
   2.  Fevers.  Patient continues to have fevers in spite of broad
   spectrum antibiotics with aztreonam, doxycycline, caspofung, and
   vancomycin and steroids.  All cultures data has been negative except
   for yeast in multiple sites.  Gonorrhea/Chlamydia also negative.  No
   clear infectious source, so concern for autoimmune disease versus drug
   fevers.  WBC elevated and continuing to rise, though confounded by high
   dose steroid use.  TEE today did not show endocarditis.
   -Continue broad antimicroibial coverage with Vancomycin, aztreonam,
   doxycycline and caspofungin.
   -Appreciate ID and rheum input.
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
   -f/u cultures
   -Ethic consult pending regarding HIV testing
   3.  Renal failure.  Creatinine continues to rise today and urine output
   is poor.  UOP did not respond to fluid challenges or lasix yesterday.
   Given embolic stroke and elevated LFTs and MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.  No recent episodes of hypotension
   and no new medications.
   - renal consult for possible biopsy and concern for vasculitis
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -renal ultrasound
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds (vanc, aztreonam
   adjusted)
   4.  Respiratoty Alkalosis.  Patient remains tachypneic with respiratory
   alkalosis in spite of increased sedation.  Concern for central
   process.  Will try starting haldol for agitation in an effort to
   lighten sedation.
   - follow ABG, no vent changes for now
   5.  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  When sedation CT and MRI concerning
   for embolic stroke vs septic emboli.  Patient not currently stable
   enough to attempt TEE; would not likely change management at present.
   Pt with minimal L arm and head movement overnight with weaning of
   sedation which is encouraging.   Still not following commands.
   -continue to lighten sedation as tolerated
   -follow neuro exam, mental status
   -Appreciate neuro input
   #NSTEMI: S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.
   [**Name14 (STitle) 427**] aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up as above
   #Transaminitis: thought to be [**12-29**] ZOsyn. RUQ U/S unremarkable.
   Improving.
   -continue to monitor.
   -avoid Tylenol and other hepatotoxins
   # Hyperglycemia- exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   # ETOH use: no evidence of chronic liver disease.
   -Continue MVI/Thiamine/Folate.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, emobolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, emboli (though no clear embolic source).
   1.  Respiratory failure secondary to resolving pneumonia and
   bronchospasm.   Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 422**] with
   multifocal pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation.
   AFB negative x 3 and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly and patient is requiring only FIo2 of 40, however has
   persistent respiratory alkalosis.  Not currently wheezing after three
   days of steroids (d1 [**7-30**]).
    -continue standing and PRN nebs
    -continue broad antimicrobial coverage with aztreonam, doxy, caspo
   (will d/c vanco due to renal failure)
   - renally dose vanco
    -appreciate ID input
    -f/u micro data
    -titrate down steroids given lack of wheezing on exam for 48 hours
   .
   2.  Fevers.  Patient continues to have fevers in spite of broad
   spectrum antibiotics with aztreonam, doxycycline, caspofung, and
   vancomycin and steroids.  All cultures data has been negative except
   for yeast in multiple sites.  Gonorrhea/Chlamydia also negative.  No
   clear infectious source, so concern for autoimmune disease versus drug
   fevers.  WBC elevated and continuing to rise, though confounded by high
   dose steroid use.  TEE today did not show endocarditis.
   -Continue broad antimicroibial coverage with Vancomycin, aztreonam,
   doxycycline and caspofungin.
   -Appreciate ID and rheum input.
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
   -f/u cultures
   -Ethic consult pending regarding HIV testing
   3.  Renal failure.  Creatinine continues to rise today and urine output
   is poor.  UOP did not respond to fluid challenges or lasix yesterday.
   Given embolic stroke and elevated LFTs and MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.  No recent episodes of hypotension
   and no new medications.
   - renal consult for possible biopsy and concern for vasculitis
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -renal ultrasound
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds (vanc, aztreonam
   adjusted)
   4.  Respiratoty Alkalosis.  Patient remains tachypneic with respiratory
   alkalosis in spite of increased sedation.  Concern for central
   process.  Will try starting haldol for agitation in an effort to
   lighten sedation.
   - follow ABG, no vent changes for now
   5.  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   when sedations is weaned.  Unable to get MRI of brain due to bare metal
   stents.
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   - initiate standing haldol
   - EEG
   - appreciate neurology recs
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.  Initially thought to be secondary for zosyn but
   given her multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary
   to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor.
   -avoid Tylenol and other hepatotoxins
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a significant medical history of asthma and recent admission for NSTEMI. She was initially treated for presumed pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, fever, and worsening acute kidney injury (ARF). She also has a history of embolic events, as evidenced by multiple hypodense areas on brain CT. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing fevers, diaphoresis, and leukocytosis. She has been on broad antimicrobial coverage, including vancomycin, aztreonam, doxycycline, and caspofungin. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 106/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator. The patient is sedated and unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's urine output remains low, despite fluid challenges and diuretic administration. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal ultrasound are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.
   1. Respiratory failure:  CXR underwhelming as to cause of her
   respiratory failure.  Respiratory alkalosis is likely due to CNS
   process.
   - Currently doing well on ventilator but mental status limits
   extubation as does tachypnea when sedation is weaned
   - wean steroids to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies
    -cont current abx/antifungal except d/c vancomycin; appreciate ID
   input
   - cont albuterol/atrovent q4h
   - give haldol (check QTc first) and wean sedation
   2. Fevers:  Fever curve is improved but is on steroids.  Differential
   shows left shift but no bands.  Abx as above.
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
   - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE unable to be performed due to hypoxemia.  Spontaneous
   moved 3 extremities last night after holding propofol.  Will discuss
   with neuro regarding utility of either LP or EEG.
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Stable; improved after d/c of zosyn.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine continues to rise with low urine output.  ? if she
   had an embolic event.
   - repeat urine sediment
   - check lytes this afternoon
   - renally dose medications; held vancomycin
   - renal consult
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for
   many days.  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI (Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction), respiratory failure, persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The CXR (chest X-ray) shows a developing right pleural effusion, persistent retrocardiac opacity suggestive of atelectasis/effusion/infiltrate, and improving right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate. The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, and the patient's mental status limits extubation.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has an unclear cause of altered mental status. The MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) findings are discussed but not specified in the note. The TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) is negative, and TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) cannot be performed due to hypoxemia. The patient showed spontaneous movement of three extremities last night after holding propofol. A discussion with neurology regarding the utility of lumbar puncture (LP) or electroencephalogram (EEG) is planned.

3. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are stable and improved after discontinuing zosyn. 

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level continues to rise with low urine output. It is uncertain if she had an embolic event. Further investigations, including repeating urine sediment, checking electrolytes, and consulting a renal specialist, are planned.

5. History of EtOH (ethanol) abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, but it is out of the window for withdrawal. Benzodiazepines have been administered for several days, and thiamine, folate, and movement disorders are being addressed.

6. Other findings: The patient has a history of NSTEMI with RCA (right coronary artery) stenting. An echo with inferolateral hypokinesis is mentioned. The patient is on multiple medications including aspirin, beta-blocker, Plavix, and has held ace inhibitors due to renal failure.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated LFTs, acute renal failure, and a history of EtOH abuse."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.
   24 Hour Events:
   - creatinine worsening:  UOP did not respond to either IVF or lasix
   - FeNa 0.2%
   - sedation lightened yesterday:  moved LUE/LLE, some movement of RLE,
   no movement of RUE.  Was coughing and tachypneic but never responded to
   voice or followed commands.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.
   1. Respiratory failure:  CXR underwhelming as to cause of her
   respiratory failure.  Respiratory alkalosis is likely due to CNS
   process.
   - Currently doing well on ventilator but mental status limits
   extubation as does tachypnea when sedation is weaned
   - wean steroids to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies
    -cont current abx/antifungal except d/c vancomycin; appreciate ID
   input
   - cont albuterol/atrovent q4h
   - give haldol (check QTc first) and wean sedation
   2. Fevers:  Fever curve is improved but is on steroids.  Differential
   shows left shift but no bands.  Abx as above.
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
   - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
   - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE unable to be performed due to hypoxemia.  Spontaneous
   moved 3 extremities last night after holding propofol.  Will discuss
   with neuro regarding utility of either LP or EEG.
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Stable; improved after d/c of zosyn.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine continues to rise with low urine output.  ? if she
   had an embolic event.
   - repeat urine sediment
   - check lytes this afternoon
   - renally dose medications; held vancomycin
   - renal consult
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for
   many days.  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The cause of respiratory failure is not clear from the provided information. However, the patient's altered mental status limits extubation, and tachypnea occurs when sedation is weaned. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider weaning sedation cautiously.

2. Fevers: The patient's fever curve has improved, but she is on steroids, which can cause immunosuppression. Antibiotics have been given, but the specific type is not mentioned. It would be necessary to continue monitoring the patient's temperature and reassessing the need for antibiotics based on further investigations.

3. s/p MI: The patient had a myocardial infarction (MI) and underwent stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA). She is currently on aspirin, beta-blockers, and Plavix. However, her renal function is impaired, and medications should be adjusted accordingly. Regular monitoring of cardiac enzymes and symptoms of ischemia is important.

4. Altered mental status: The cause of the patient's altered mental status is unclear. An MRI was performed, but the results"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of thrombus, recent BMS placement for NSTEMI, and an unknown history of thrombus. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to AMS (altered mental status) likely secondary to toxic encephalopathy. The patient has been febrile in spite of broad-spectrum antibiotics and steroids. There are concerns about possible APL syndrome, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, thrombotic/embolic event, or pulmonary renal syndrome. Renal evaluation revealed RBC casts, and a kidney biopsy has been performed. A TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) showed 2+ MR (mitral regurgitation) but no vegetations, ASD (atrial septal defect), PFO (patent foramen ovale), LA/RA thrombus, or aortic atheroma. The patient has been on heparin sodium (prophylaxis) since 12 AM on 08/03. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, blood pressure ranging from 113/84 to 146/92 mmHg, heart rate between 85-101 bpm, respiratory rate of 19-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. She is receiving multiple medications including Haldol, Caspofungin, Doxycycline, and Aztreonam. Lab results show"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, emobolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, emboli (though no clear embolic source).
   1.  Respiratory failure secondary to resolving pneumonia and
   bronchospasm.   Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 422**] with
   multifocal pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation.
   AFB negative x 3 and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly and patient is requiring only FIo2 of 40, however has
   persistent respiratory alkalosis.  Not currently wheezing after three
   days of steroids (d1 [**7-30**]).
    -continue standing and PRN nebs
    -continue broad antimicrobial coverage with aztreonam, doxy, caspo
   (will d/c vanco due to renal failure)
   - renally dose vanco
    -appreciate ID input
    -f/u micro data
    -titrate down steroids given lack of wheezing on exam for 48 hours
   .
   2.  Fevers.  Patient continues to have fevers in spite of broad
   spectrum antibiotics with aztreonam, doxycycline, caspofung, and
   vancomycin and steroids.  All cultures data has been negative except
   for yeast in multiple sites.  Gonorrhea/Chlamydia also negative.  No
   clear infectious source, so concern for autoimmune disease versus drug
   fevers.  WBC elevated and continuing to rise, though confounded by high
   dose steroid use.  TEE today did not show endocarditis.
   -Continue broad antimicroibial coverage with Vancomycin, aztreonam,
   doxycycline and caspofungin.
   -Appreciate ID and rheum input.
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
   -f/u cultures
   -Ethic consult pending regarding HIV testing
   3.  Renal failure.  Creatinine continues to rise today and urine output
   is poor.  UOP did not respond to fluid challenges or lasix yesterday.
   Given embolic stroke and elevated LFTs and MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.  No recent episodes of hypotension
   and no new medications.
   - renal consult for possible biopsy and concern for vasculitis
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -renal ultrasound
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds (vanc, aztreonam
   adjusted)
   4.  Respiratoty Alkalosis.  Patient remains tachypneic with respiratory
   alkalosis in spite of increased sedation.  Concern for central
   process.  Will try starting haldol for agitation in an effort to
   lighten sedation.
   - follow ABG, no vent changes for now
   5.  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   when sedations is weaned.  Unable to get MRI of brain due to bare metal
   stents.
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   - initiate standing haldol
   - EEG
   - appreciate neurology recs
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.  Initially thought to be secondary for zosyn but
   given her multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary
   to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor.
   -avoid Tylenol and other hepatotoxins
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, fevers, renal failure, respiratory alkalosis, altered mental status, NSTEMI, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, and potential hypercoagulable state. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening pneumonia or bronchospasm.
2. Fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, which may indicate an ongoing infection or non-infectious cause such as drug fevers or autoimmune disease.
3. Progressive renal failure, potentially due to vasculitis, thrombus/infarct, or other causes.
4. Persistent respiratory alkalosis despite increased FiO2 and sedation.
5. Altered mental status with potential causes including embolic stroke, septic emboli, high dose steroids, prolonged ICU stay, and renal failure.
6. NSTEMI with ongoing ischemia and potential hypercoagulable state.
7. Transaminitis possibly secondary to multi-organ failure or drug-induced liver injury.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, emobolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, emboli (though no clear embolic source).
   1.  Respiratory failure secondary to resolving pneumonia and
   bronchospasm.   Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 422**] with
   multifocal pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation.
   AFB negative x 3 and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly and patient is requiring only FIo2 of 40, however has
   persistent respiratory alkalosis.  Not currently wheezing after three
   days of steroids (d1 [**7-30**]).
    -continue standing and PRN nebs
    -continue broad antimicrobial coverage with aztreonam, doxy, caspo
   (will d/c vanco due to renal failure)
   - renally dose vanco
    -appreciate ID input
    -f/u micro data
    -titrate down steroids given lack of wheezing on exam for 48 hours
   .
   2.  Fevers.  Patient continues to have fevers in spite of broad
   spectrum antibiotics with aztreonam, doxycycline, caspofung, and
   vancomycin and steroids.  All cultures data has been negative except
   for yeast in multiple sites.  Gonorrhea/Chlamydia also negative.  No
   clear infectious source, so concern for autoimmune disease versus drug
   fevers.  WBC elevated and continuing to rise, though confounded by high
   dose steroid use.  TEE today did not show endocarditis.
   -Continue broad antimicroibial coverage with Vancomycin, aztreonam,
   doxycycline and caspofungin.
   -Appreciate ID and rheum input.
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
   -f/u cultures
   -Ethic consult pending regarding HIV testing
   3.  Renal failure.  Creatinine continues to rise today and urine output
   is poor.  UOP did not respond to fluid challenges or lasix yesterday.
   Given embolic stroke and elevated LFTs and MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.  No recent episodes of hypotension
   and no new medications.
   - renal consult for possible biopsy and concern for vasculitis
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -renal ultrasound
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds (vanc, aztreonam
   adjusted)
   4.  Respiratoty Alkalosis.  Patient remains tachypneic with respiratory
   alkalosis in spite of increased sedation.  Concern for central
   process.  Will try starting haldol for agitation in an effort to
   lighten sedation.
   - follow ABG, no vent changes for now
   5.  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   when sedations is weaned.  Unable to get MRI of brain due to bare metal
   stents.
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   - initiate standing haldol
   - EEG
   - appreciate neurology recs
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.  Initially thought to be secondary for zosyn but
   given her multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary
   to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor.
   -avoid Tylenol and other hepatotoxins
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 479] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, admitted to the ICU with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure (ARF) without a clear unifying diagnosis. She is suspected to have a hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and emboli. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to resolving pneumonia and bronchospasm. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, she continues to have fevers. Her renal function is deteriorating, and there is concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis. The etiology for her altered mental status is unclear, and she has a prolonged ICU stay, high-dose steroid use, and an embolic stroke. She also has a history of NSTEMI, inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic MR, and is on dual antiplatelet therapy. Other findings include transaminitis, hyperglycemia exacerbated by steroids, and hypercoagulability workup pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her pneumonia does not improve further or if there is bronchospasm.
2. Fevers: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers. This could indicate an ongoing infection or non-infectious cause such as autoimmune disease or drug fevers.
3. Renal"

   44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal
   pneumonia, emobolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF without
   clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable state,
   vasculitis, emboli (though no clear embolic source).
   24 Hour Events:
   -Steroids were tapered from solumedrol 40 q8hr to 40 q12 hour
   -Haldol 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] was started in order to minimize sedation
   - Trial on PS was unsuccessful --> ABG worsened, so was switched back
   to AC
   - Renal evaluated patient and noted ?RBC casts.  They performed a
   biopsy of the kidneys.  They requested C3 and C4 and anticardiolipin be
   sent.  Differential is APL syndrome, post-infectious
   glomerulonephritis, thrombotic/emolic event, versus pulmonary renal
   syndrome.  Renal ultrasound also performed.
   - TEE performed and did not show vegetations, no ASD or PFO, no LA/RA
   thrombus, no aortic atheroma, and 2+ MR noted.
   - Neurology felt AMS likely secondary to toxic encephalopathy, but
   recommended EEG and MRI.  They felt LP is likely to be un-revealing but
   would be useful if EEG and MRI were negative.  Patient was unable to
   get MRI due to recent BMS placement for NSTEMI.
   -PCP reported that she had no history of thrombus in past.  He never
   tested her for HIV in the past.
   - Patient febrile in spite of broad spectrum antiobiotics and steroids
   - ID recommended stopping vancomycin and aztreonam.  They recommended
   checking T cell subtypes and immunoglobulins.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure secondary to resolving pneumonia and
   bronchospasm.   Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 422**] with
   multifocal pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation.
   AFB negative x 3 and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly, however has persistent respiratory alkalosis and did not
   tolerate PSV trial yesterday.  Not currently wheezing after three days
   of steroids (d1 [**7-30**]) and has tolerated weaning of steroids
   - continue to wean down steroids to solumedrol 40mg PO daily from Q12h
   - decrease PEEP to 5, wean down on sedation as tolerated with
   pre-medication with haldol prior to turning down sedation
    -continue standing and PRN nebs
   - continue doxycycline to cover atypical organisms. Patient
s CXR
   improved, now s/p vanc/aztreonam
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Patient continues to have fevers in spite
   of prior coverage with broad spectrum antibiotics with aztreonam,
   doxycycline, caspofung, and vancomycin and steroids.  All cultures data
   has been negative except for yeast in multiple sites.  TEE negative,
   CXR improving. Patient without increase in fever curve since
   discontinuing vancomycin and aztreonam but still with low grade fevers.
   If infectious workup negative, consider central process mediating
   temperature dysregulation vs vasculitis or immune process.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - continue caspofungin and doxy per ID recs
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o autoimmune disease
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   -f/u cultures
   3. Renal failure.  Creatinine continues to rise today to 2.2 and urine
   output is poor but stable from yesterday.  No hydronephrosis by
   ultrasound. Renal biopsy taken but results pending. Given embolic
   stroke and elevated LFTs and MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   4.   Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done
   yesterday. Plan for MRI if cleared by radiology with patient
s recent
   BMS placement.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of EEG
   - MRI head if cleared by radiology
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   - continue standing haldol
   5.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.  Initially thought to be secondary for zosyn but
   given her multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary
   to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
 add on LFTs this AM
   -avoid Tylenol and other hepatotoxins
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who was admitted with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's condition is complicated by fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure secondary to resolving pneumonia and bronchospasm, and thrombotic events.

The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, aztreonam, doxycycline, and caspofungin, but still has persistent low-grade fevers. The TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) was negative for vegetations, and the CXR (chest X-ray) shows improvement.

Renal function is compromised with a rising creatinine level of 2.2 and poor urine output. A renal biopsy has been performed but results are pending. The patient also has evidence of embolic stroke and elevated liver function tests, raising concerns for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.

The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, with potential causes including embolic stroke, septic emboli (although TEE negative), prolonged ICU stay, high-dose steroids, and renal failure. An EEG (electroencephalogram) has been done, and an MRI of the head is planned if cleared by radiology.

The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (N"

   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  CXR underwhelming as to cause of her
   respiratory failure.  Respiratory alkalosis is likely due to CNS
   process.
   - Currently doing well on ventilator but mental status limits
   extubation as does tachypnea when sedation is weaned - has significant
   respiratory alkalosis with pH up to 7.53 on PSV.
   - decrease peep to 5
   - wean steroids to solumedrol 40 daily, monitor for bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies
    -appreciate ID input; have stopped vanc and aztreonam given lack of
   positive culture data
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - give haldol and wean sedation
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.
   - tailoring antibiotics, weaning steroids as above
   - RBC casts on UA suggestive of a vasculitis process - appreciate Renal
   input; awaiting biopsy results
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - checking T-cell subsets per ID to assess for potential
   immunodeficiency
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE unable to be performed due to hypoxemia.
   - repeat MRI per neuro
   - EEG
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Were trending down.  Will add on for today.  Seemed
   to be temporally related to zosyn as improved when this was stopped.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine continues to rise, urine output improving.  BUN
   steadily rising also contributing to mental status.
   - f/u C3, C4

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a chief complaint of NSTEMI and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The patient's overall condition is confusing and may suggest a vasculitis given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, multiple serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The CXR is underwhelming as to the cause of respiratory failure, and respiratory alkalosis is likely due to a CNS process. The patient's mental status limits extubation as does tachypnea when sedation is weaned.

2. Fevers: The patient continues to be febrile. Tailoring antibiotics and weaning steroids will be continued. RBC casts on UA suggest a vasculitis process, and renal input is appreciated. Awaiting biopsy results, checking T-cell subsets per ID to assess for potential immunodeficiency, and no endocarditis on TEE are also mentioned.

3. s/p MI: The patient had a myocardial infarction (MI) with subsequent placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS) to the right coronary artery (RCA). The echo with inferolateral hypokinesis indicates"

   Microbiology: No new micro data.
   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  CXR underwhelming as to cause of her
   respiratory failure.  Respiratory alkalosis is likely due to CNS
   process.
   - Currently doing well on ventilator but mental status limits
   extubation as does tachypnea when sedation is weaned - has significant
   respiratory alkalosis with pH up to 7.53 on PSV.
   - decrease peep to 5
   - wean steroids to solumedrol 40 daily, monitor for bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies
    -appreciate ID input; have stopped vanc and aztreonam given lack of
   positive culture data
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   -          give haldol and wean sedation
   -          She will need trachesostomy next week given continued
   problems with encephalopathy, worsening uremia, and sedation
   sensitivity
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.
   - tailoring antibiotics, weaning steroids as above
   - RBC casts on UA suggestive of a vasculitis process - appreciate Renal
   input; awaiting biopsy results
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - checking T-cell subsets per ID to assess for potential
   immunodeficiency
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE unable to be performed due to hypoxemia.
   - repeat MRI per neuro
   - EEG
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Were trending down.  Will add on for today.  Seemed
   to be temporally related to zosyn as improved when this was stopped.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine continues to rise, urine output improving.  BUN
   steadily rising also contributing to mental status.
   - f/u C3, C4
   - f/u renal biopsy
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for
   many days.  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI and course complicated by persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The patient's overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, multiple serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator due to respiratory failure. The CXR is underwhelming as to the cause of her respiratory failure, and respiratory alkalosis is likely due to a CNS process. The patient's mental status limits extubation as does tachypnea when sedation is weaned.

2. Fevers: The patient continues to be febrile. Tailoring antibiotics, weaning steroids, and addressing RBC casts on UA suggestive of a vasculitis process are ongoing. No endocarditis on TEE, and checking T-cell subsets per ID to assess for potential immunodeficiency are also part of the management plan.

3. s/p MI: The patient had a myocardial infarction (MI) and has undergone balloon angioplasty with stent placement (BMS) to RCA. The echo shows inferolateral hypokinesis. Continuous aspirin, beta-blocker, and Plavix therapy are recommended. Holding ace due to renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure: secondary to resolving multifocal pneumonia and
   bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving significantly, however has
   persistent respiratory alkalosis and did not tolerate PSV trial
   yesterday.  Not currently wheezing after three days of steroids (d1
   [**7-30**]) and has tolerated weaning of steroids
   - continue to wean down steroids to solumedrol 20mg PO daily
   - decrease PEEP to 5, wean down on sedation as tolerated with
   pre-medication with haldol prior to turning down sedation
    -continue standing and PRN nebs
   - continue doxycycline to cover atypical organisms. Patient
s CXR
   improved, now s/p vanc/aztreonam
   -need to begin to consider trach/ PEG given prolonged course
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Patient continues to have fevers in spite
   of prior coverage with broad spectrum antibiotics with aztreonam,
   doxycycline, caspofung, and vancomycin and steroids.  All cultures data
   has been negative except for yeast in multiple sites.  TEE negative,
   CXR improving. Patient without increase in fever curve since
   discontinuing vancomycin and aztreonam but still with low grade fevers.
   If infectious workup negative, consider central process mediating
   temperature dysregulation vs vasculitis or immune process.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - continue caspofungin and doxy per ID recs
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   -f/u cultures
   3. Renal failure.  Creatinine continues to rise today to 2.2 and urine
   output is poor but stable from yesterday.  No hydronephrosis by
   ultrasound. Renal biopsy performed [**8-2**], results pending. Given
   concurrent embolic stroke, elevated LFTs, MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   4.   Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done
   yesterday. Plan for MRI if cleared by radiology with patient
s recent
   BMS placement.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of EEG
   - MRI head if cleared by radiology
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   - continue standing haldol
   5.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.  Initially thought to be secondary for zosyn but
   given her multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary
   to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
 add on LFTs this AM
   -avoid Tylenol and other hepatotoxins
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, fevers of unknown origin, renal failure, altered mental status, NSTEMI, transaminitis, and hyperglycemia. The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, sedatives, analgesics, and antiplatelet agents. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains intubated and sedated. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal evidence of evolving brain infarcts in the frontal and occipital regions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to resolving multifocal pneumonia and bronchospasm. The patient has tolerated weaning of steroids and decreased PEEP to 5. However, she did not tolerate a trial of spontaneous ventilation with premedication. She continues to require mechanical ventilation.
2. Fevers of unknown origin: Despite prior coverage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers. Negative cultures except for yeast in multiple sites suggest a non-infectious cause. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the fevers.
3. Renal failure: The"

   FINDINGS: Again signal abnormalities are seen in the left frontal lobe
   and left occipital lobe as well as in the right occipital lobe. Since
   the previous study, the abnormalities on diffusion imaging have evolved
   with hyperintense signal seen on ADC map compared to the low signal
   areas of low signal intensity. These findings indicate evolution of
   infarct. There are no new acute infarcts identified. There is no
   midline shift or hydrocephalus
   seen. Suprasellar and craniocervical regions are normal on the sagittal
   images. Extensive soft tissue changes are seen in bilateral mastoid air
   cells as before. IMPRESSION: Interval evolution of diffusion
   abnormalities in the left frontal and occipital lobes indicating
   evolving infarcts. No new signal abnormalities are seen. No new areas
   of slow diffusion identified.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure: secondary to resolving multifocal pneumonia and
   bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving significantly, however has
   persistent respiratory alkalosis and did not tolerate PSV trial
   yesterday.  Not currently wheezing after three days of steroids (d1
   [**7-30**]) and has tolerated weaning of steroids
   - keep steroids at solumedrol 40mg PO daily for now as currently with
   some wheeze on exam
   -continue standing and PRN nebs
   - continue doxycycline to cover atypical organisms. Patient
s CXR
   improved, now s/p vanc/aztreonam
   -plan for trach/ PEG tomorrow
   2. Fevers of unknown origin: Pt again spiking high fevers to 102 now
   that steroids are being weaned. Currently on doxy and caspo, but all
   cultures data has been negative except for yeast in multiple sites.
   TEE negative, CXR improving.  This may be a  central process mediating
   temperature dysregulation vs vasculitis or immune process.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - continue caspofungin and doxy per ID recs
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   -f/u cultures
   3. Renal failure.  Creatinine continues to rise today to 2.2 and urine
   output is poor but stable from yesterday.  No hydronephrosis by
   ultrasound. Renal biopsy performed [**8-2**], results pending. Given
   concurrent embolic stroke, elevated LFTs, MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   4.   Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done
   yesterday. Plan for MRI if cleared by radiology with patient
s recent
   BMS placement.

   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.  Initially thought to be secondary for zosyn but
   given her multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary
   to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of asthma and is currently experiencing respiratory alkalosis. They also have persistent wheezing and did not tolerate a trial of spontaneous breathing. These factors suggest ongoing respiratory issues that may require continued respiratory support.

2. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient is experiencing high fevers despite being on antibiotics. Cultures have been negative except for yeast in multiple sites. This indicates a possible central process causing temperature dysregulation, which could be related to vasculitis, an immune process, or another underlying condition.

3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and urine output is poor. No hydronephrosis is seen on ultrasound. A renal biopsy has been performed, but results are pending. The combination of renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, myocardial infarction at an early age, and concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis suggests the need for further evaluation and management of renal function.

4. Altered mental status: The patient has limited movement on the left side and has had prolonged ICU stay with high-dose steroid use. There is a need to assess the cause of altered mental status, which may include embolic stroke, septic emboli, rising BUN in the setting of renal failure, prolonged sedation, or other factors.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, fevers of unknown origin, renal failure, altered mental status, and a recent myocardial infarction. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation and has persistent respiratory alkalosis. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not appropriately managed.

2. Fevers of unknown origin: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient continues to have fevers. This suggests an ongoing infectious process or another underlying cause. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating worsening renal function. This may lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances.

4. Altered mental status: The etiology for the patient's altered mental status is unclear, but it is likely multifactorial. There is a risk of developing delirium or other cognitive impairments due to prolonged ICU stay, high-dose steroids, and other contributing factors.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure secondary to resolving pneumonia and
   bronchospasm.   Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 422**] with
   multifocal pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation.
   AFB negative x 3 and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 419**]. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly, however has persistent respiratory alkalosis and did not
   tolerate PSV trial yesterday.  Not currently wheezing after three days
   of steroids (d1 [**7-30**]) and has tolerated weaning of steroids
   - continue to wean down steroids to solumedrol 40mg PO daily from Q12h
   - decrease PEEP to 5, wean down on sedation as tolerated with
   pre-medication with haldol prior to turning down sedation
    -continue standing and PRN nebs
   - continue doxycycline to cover atypical organisms. Patient
s CXR
   improved, now s/p vanc/aztreonam
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Patient continues to have fevers in spite
   of prior coverage with broad spectrum antibiotics with aztreonam,
   doxycycline, caspofung, and vancomycin and steroids.  All cultures data
   has been negative except for yeast in multiple sites.  TEE negative,
   CXR improving. Patient without increase in fever curve since
   discontinuing vancomycin and aztreonam but still with low grade fevers.
   If infectious workup negative, consider central process mediating
   temperature dysregulation vs vasculitis or immune process.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - continue caspofungin and doxy per ID recs
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o autoimmune disease
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   -f/u cultures
   3. Renal failure.  Creatinine continues to rise today to 2.2 and urine
   output is poor but stable from yesterday.  No hydronephrosis by
   ultrasound. Renal biopsy taken but results pending. Given embolic
   stroke and elevated LFTs and MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   4.   Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done
   yesterday. Plan for MRI if cleared by radiology with patient
s recent
   BMS placement.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of EEG
   - MRI head if cleared by radiology
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   - continue standing haldol
   5.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.  Initially thought to be secondary for zosyn but
   given her multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary
   to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
 add on LFTs this AM
   -avoid Tylenol and other hepatotoxins
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing fevers of unknown origin despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and steroids. Her respiratory status has improved significantly, but she still has persistent respiratory alkalosis and did not tolerate a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) yesterday. The patient's renal function is deteriorating with rising creatinine levels and poor urine output. A renal biopsy has been taken but results are pending. The patient also has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including embolic stroke, renal failure, prolonged ICU stay, and high-dose steroid use. An MRI of the head is planned if the patient is cleared by radiology. The patient had an MI and underwent placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) in the distal RCA, which was completely occluded on admission. There are concerns about a hypercoagulable state given the young age of the patient and the presence of multiple organ failure. The patient is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, and statins.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to unresolved pneumonia or bronchospasm.
2. Fevers of unknown origin: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient"

   FINDINGS: Again signal abnormalities are seen in the left frontal lobe
   and left occipital lobe as well as in the right occipital lobe. Since
   the previous study, the abnormalities on diffusion imaging have evolved
   with hyperintense signal seen on ADC map compared to the low signal
   areas of low signal intensity. These findings indicate evolution of
   infarct. There are no new acute infarcts identified. There is no
   midline shift or hydrocephalus
   seen. Suprasellar and craniocervical regions are normal on the sagittal
   images. Extensive soft tissue changes are seen in bilateral mastoid air
   cells as before. IMPRESSION: Interval evolution of diffusion
   abnormalities in the left frontal and occipital lobes indicating
   evolving infarcts. No new signal abnormalities are seen. No new areas
   of slow diffusion identified.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has resolving multifocal pneumonia and bronchospasm, which may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Fevers of unknown origin: Despite being on antibiotics and antifungal medications, the patient continues to have high fevers. This could indicate an ongoing infection or a non-infectious inflammatory process.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. This could progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not treated promptly.

4. Stroke: The patient has had an embolic stroke, and there is a concern for recurrent strokes due to her hypercoagulable state and potential for thromboembolic events.

5. Myocardial infarction (MI): The patient had an acute MI, and there is a concern for future cardiac events due to her risk factors and hypercoagulable state.

6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors such as sedation, embolic stroke, septic emboli, renal failure, or prolonged ICU stay.

7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to chronic disease or blood loss.

8. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated"

   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  No obvious cause, originally thought due to
   bronchospasm with hx of asthma.  Exam improved with steroids.
   Respiratory alkalosis is likely due to CNS process.
   - switch to PSV
   - wean steroids to solumedrol 20 daily, monitor for bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies: most negative
   to date
   - appreciate ID input; have stopped vanc and aztreonam given lack of
   positive culture data.  ? if ok to stop doxy today
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - She will need trachesostomy this week given continued problems with
   encephalopathy, worsening uremia, and sedation sensitivity.  Will d/w
   IP & family.
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.  Unclear source.  Multiple cx
   negative except yeast in urine/sputum.
   - tailoring antibiotics, weaning steroids as above
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - checking T-cell subsets per ID to assess for potential
   immunodeficiency
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix

   - EEG c/w toxic metabolic encephalopathy
   - likely a component of uremia at this point
   - d/c haldol as no clear improvement
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Slightly higher today.  Will monitor.  Getting
   tylenol q6h for fevers, will attempt to hold.

The overall picture is confusing and suggestive of a vasculitis given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, multiple serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date. There is also a possibility of a hypercoagulable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on head MRI.

The patient has respiratory failure, no obvious cause initially thought due to bronchospasm with a history of asthma.

The plan is to switch to pressure support ventilation (PSV), wean steroids to solumedrol 20 daily, monitor for bronchospasm, and follow up with multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies. It has been decided to stop vancomycin and aztreonam due to lack of positive culture data, and to consider stopping doxycycline today.

The patient will need a tracheostomy this week due to continued problems with encephalopathy, worsening uremia, and sedation sensitivity. The family and IP will be informed about this procedure.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  No obvious cause, originally thought due to
   bronchospasm with hx of asthma.  Exam improved with steroids.
   Respiratory alkalosis is likely due to CNS process.
   - switch to PSV
   - wean steroids to solumedrol 20 daily, monitor for bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies: most negative
   to date
   - appreciate ID input; have stopped vanc and aztreonam given lack of
   positive culture data.  ? if ok to stop doxy today
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - She will need trachesostomy this week given continued problems with
   encephalopathy, worsening uremia, and sedation sensitivity.  Will d/w
   IP & family.
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.  Unclear source.  Multiple cx
   negative except yeast in urine/sputum.
   - tailoring antibiotics, weaning steroids as above
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - checking T-cell subsets per ID to assess for potential
   immunodeficiency
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - repeat MRI shows expected evolution of infarcts, no new lesions
   - EEG c/w toxic metabolic encephalopathy
   - likely a component of uremia at this point
   - d/c haldol as no clear improvement
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Slightly higher today.  Will monitor.  Getting
   tylenol q6h for fevers, will attempt to hold.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine now stable.  BUN likely contributing to mental
   status.
   - f/u C3, C4
   - f/u renal biopsy
   - appreciate renal input
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction), persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The overall picture is confusing and suggests a vasculitis given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, multiple serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date. There is also a question of a hypercoagulable state given the RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on head MRI.

The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, fevers, post-myocardial infarction, altered mental status, elevated LFTs, acute renal failure, and possible history of ethanol abuse.

The patient's respiratory function is currently supported by mechanical ventilation with a controlled mode ventilation (CMV) and assist/automatic flow. The patient has been responding well to this mode of ventilation, with stable oxygenation and adequate respiratory parameters.

The patient's fevers continue to be unexplained, and efforts are being made to tailor the antibiotics based on the negative cultures except for yeast in the urine and sputum. The source of infection remains unclear.

The patient has experienced a myocardial infarction and has undergone stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is currently on aspirin, beta-blocker, and Plavix to manage the post-myocardial infarction"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure.  Initially intubated for multifocal pneumonia
   (now resolving) and bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly, however has persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   secondary to neurological impairment.  Was on steroids for
   bronchospasm, though not currently wheezing, so will stop steroids.
   Was on antibiotics to cover pneumonia, however will stop these given
   persistent daily fevers and no positive cultures.
   - d/c steroids for bronchospasm
   -continue standing and PRN nebs
   -plan for trach on Wednesday
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Patient continues to have daily fevers
   with no positive cultures except for yeast in multiple sites.  Given
   persistent fevers and no documented source, will stop steroids and
   antibiotics.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - continue caspofungin and doxy per ID recs
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   -f/u cultures
   #. Renal failure.  Creatinine stable. Urine output improving. Given
   concurrent embolic stroke, elevated LFTs, MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable, f/u C3,C4
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   #   Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done
   yesterday, unremarkable
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - MRI head relatively unchanged
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   #Anemia- Hct did not bump after 2 units PRBC
s for renal biopsy [**8-2**].
   -trend hct.
   .
   #.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   #.  Transaminitis. Slightly worse today--? Due to Tylenol for fevers?
   This was iInitially thought to be secondary for zosyn but given her
   multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary to
   thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
 add on LFTs this AM
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   #.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is concerning for hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and embolic process. She is currently intubated for respiratory failure due to pneumonia, which is now resolving. The patient continues to have daily fevers with no positive cultures except for yeast in multiple sites. Her renal function is stable with improving urine output. The patient has altered mental status with an unclear etiology, likely multifactorial. She also has anemia, NSTEMI, and transaminitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still at risk for respiratory failure due to neurological impairment causing persistent respiratory alkalosis.
2. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's persistent daily fevers with no documented source may indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying condition.
3. Renal failure: Although the patient's creatinine is stable and urine output is improving, she still requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to multiple factors including embolic stroke, prolonged ICU stay, high-dose steroids, and rising BUN in the setting of renal failure. Further evaluation and management by a neurologist is recommended.
5. Hypercoagulable state: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure.  Initially intubated for multifocal pneumonia
   (now resolving) and bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly, however has persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   secondary to neurological impairment.  Was on steroids for
   bronchospasm, though not currently wheezing, so will stop steroids.
   Was on antibiotics to cover pneumonia, however will stop these given
   persistent daily fevers and no positive cultures.
   - d/c steroids for bronchospasm
   -continue standing and PRN nebs
   - continue doxycycline to cover atypical organisms. Patient
s CXR
   improved, now s/p vanc/aztreonam
   -plan for trach/ PEG tomorrow
 will discuss with family today
   2. Fevers of unknown origin: Pt again spiking high fevers to 102 now
   that steroids are being weaned. Currently on doxy and caspo, but all
   cultures data has been negative except for yeast in multiple sites.
   TEE negative, CXR improving.  This may be a  central process mediating
   temperature dysregulation vs vasculitis or immune process.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - continue caspofungin and doxy per ID recs
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   -f/u cultures
   #. Renal failure.  Creatinine stable. Urine output improving. Given
   concurrent embolic stroke, elevated LFTs, MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable, f/u C3,C4
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   #   Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done
   yesterday, unremarkable
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - MRI head relatively unchanged
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   #Anemia- Hct did not bump after 2 units PRBC
s for renal biopsy [**8-2**].
   -trend hct.
   .
   #.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   #.  Transaminitis. Slightly worse today--? Due to Tylenol for fevers?
   This was iInitially thought to be secondary for zosyn but given her
   multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary to
   thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
 add on LFTs this AM
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   #.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed. 

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for pneumonia and bronchospasm. Although the pneumonia is now resolving, the patient still has persistent respiratory alkalosis likely due to neurological impairment. Steroids have been stopped as there is no current wheezing. Antibiotics will also be stopped since the patient has daily fevers without positive cultures.

2. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient continues to have high fevers despite being on doxycycline and caspofungin. All cultures have been negative except for yeast in multiple sites. TEE is negative, and CXR is improving. There may be a central process mediating temperature dysregulation, vasculitis, or immune process.

3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is stable, and urine output is improving. Given the concurrent embolic stroke, elevated LFTs, and MI at an early age, there is concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis. 

4. Altered mental status: The etiology for AMS is unclear but likely multifactorial. Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations). The patient also has rising BUN in the setting of renal failure. The patient is on high-dose steroids and has limited movement on the left side when sedation is weaned."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure.  Initially intubated for multifocal pneumonia
   (now resolving) and bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly, however has persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   secondary to neurological impairment.  Was on steroids for
   bronchospasm, though not currently wheezing, so will stop steroids.
   Was on antibiotics to cover pneumonia, however will stop these given
   persistent daily fevers and no positive cultures.
   - d/c steroids for bronchospasm
   -continue standing and PRN nebs
   -plan for trach on Wednesday
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Patient continues to have daily fevers
   with no positive cultures except for yeast in multiple sites.  Given
   persistent fevers and no documented source, will stop steroids and
   antibiotics.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - d/c antibiotics, steroids
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   - follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   - f/u cultures
   - consider HIV test
   3.  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN.  Creatinine improving.  S/p Renal
   biopsy which was unrevealing. Given concurrent embolic stroke, elevated
   LFTs, MI at early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable, f/u C3,C4
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   4.  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and was on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done,
   unremarkable.  MRI head showed evolving infarcts.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   .
   5.       Rising BUN.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to occult GI bleed, steroid use,
   versus renal failure.
   -          f/u stool guiaic
   .
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   Stably elevated LFTs.  This was iInitially thought
   to be secondary for zosyn but given her multi-organ failure, there is
   concern for infarcts secondary to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious
   source for emboli
 TEE negative) versus secondary to tylenol. RUQ U/S
   unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a complex medical history, including asthma, NSTEMI (Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction), CVA (Cerebrovascular accident or stroke), renal failure, transaminitis, and fevers of unknown origin. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and various potential complications.

Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient continues to have fevers despite being on antibiotics, and no positive cultures have been found except for yeast in multiple sites.
- She is awaiting a tracheostomy (Trach/Peg) today.
- The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still has persistent respiratory alkalosis likely secondary to neurological impairment.
- She was previously intubated for multifocal pneumonia, which is now resolving.
- The patient has been on steroids for bronchospasm, but they will be discontinued as she is no longer wheezing.
- The patient has ongoing fevers with no documented source, and antibiotics have been stopped.
- There is a concern for a hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, embolic process, and thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis in the renal failure.
- The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including embolic stroke, prolonged ICU stay, high-dose steroids, and renal failure.
- The rising BUN could be secondary to occult GI bleed, steroid use, or renal failure.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure: secondary to resolving multifocal pneumonia and
   bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving significantly, however has
   persistent respiratory alkalosis and did not tolerate PSV trial
   yesterday.  Not currently wheezing after three days of steroids (d1
   [**7-30**]) and has tolerated weaning of steroids
   - keep steroids at solumedrol 40mg PO daily for now as currently with
   some wheeze on exam
   -continue standing and PRN nebs
   - continue doxycycline to cover atypical organisms. Patient
s CXR
   improved, now s/p vanc/aztreonam
   -plan for trach/ PEG tomorrow
 will discuss with family today
   2. Fevers of unknown origin: Pt again spiking high fevers to 102 now
   that steroids are being weaned. Currently on doxy and caspo, but all
   cultures data has been negative except for yeast in multiple sites.
   TEE negative, CXR improving.  This may be a  central process mediating
   temperature dysregulation vs vasculitis or immune process.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - continue caspofungin and doxy per ID recs
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   -follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative

   #. Renal failure.  Creatinine stable. Urine output improving. Given
   concurrent embolic stroke, elevated LFTs, MI at early age, concern for
   thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable, f/u C3,C4
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   #   Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and is on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done
   yesterday, unremarkable
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - MRI head relatively unchanged
   - lighten sedation as tolerated

   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   #.  Transaminitis. Slightly worse today--? Due to Tylenol for fevers?
   This was iInitially thought to be secondary for zosyn but given her
   multi-organ failure, there is concern for infarcts secondary to
   thrombus or emboli (though no obvious source for emboli
 TEE
   negative). RUQ U/S unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition remains complex and involves multiple organ systems. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure secondary to resolving multifocal pneumonia and bronchospasm. Although her chest X-ray is improving, she still experiences persistent respiratory alkalosis and wheezing. Continuous monitoring and management of respiratory support, including steroids, nebulizers, and weaning, are necessary.
2. Fevers of Unknown Origin: The patient continues to have high fevers despite antibiotic coverage. Cultures have been negative except for yeast in multiple sites. A central process mediating temperature dysregulation or vasculitis/immune process is suspected. Further evaluation by infectious disease and rheumatology specialists, along with ongoing antibiotic therapy and culture monitoring, is required.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function remains compromised. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is essential. Renal biopsy results, C3/C4 levels, and follow-up are recommended. Avoiding nephrotoxins and adjusting medication dosages accordingly are important.
4. Altered Mental Status: The etiology of the patient's altered mental status is unclear, but it is likely multifactorial, involving factors such as embolic stroke, septic emboli, renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of NSTEMI, CVA, renal failure, and transaminitis. The patient continues to have fevers and is awaiting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. The patient has several allergies, including sulfasalazine, and has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including aztreonam, doxycycline, and caspofungin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.7°F, heart rate ranging from 80-95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/71 to 123/82 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 20-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their central venous pressure (CVP) is 17 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,151 mL and output of 2,895 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 744 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV ventilation. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 14 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  No obvious cause, originally thought due to
   bronchospasm with hx of asthma.  Exam improved with steroids.
   Respiratory alkalosis is likely due to CNS process.
   - continue PSV
   - d/c steroids, monitor for bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies: most negative
   to date
   - appreciate ID input; have stopped vanc and aztreonam given lack of
   positive culture data.  would prefer to also d/c caspo and doxy.
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - extubation currently limited by mental status.  Unfortunately trach
   may be limited by requirement for plavix; will d/w IP & Thoracics
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.  Unclear source.  Multiple cx
   negative except yeast in urine/sputum.
   - d/c steroids as above
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - checking T-cell subsets per ID to assess for potential
   immunodeficiency
   - LP today
   - ? if ok to d/c caspo /doxy as above
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - repeat MRI shows expected evolution of infarcts, no new lesions
   - EEG c/w toxic metabolic encephalopathy
   - likely a component of uremia at this point
   - d/c haldol as no clear improvement
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Slightly lower today.  Will monitor.
   - ? if source is liver given normal alk phos, total bili.  Check CK,
   GGT.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine improving.  BUN likely contributing to mental
   status.
   - f/u C3, C4
   - f/u renal biopsy
   - appreciate renal input
   - guaiac given that BUN seems out of proportion to creatinine
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who was admitted with NSTEMI and has been experiencing persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests, and urine eosinophilia. The overall picture is confusing and may suggest vasculitis due to persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, negative serologies for rheumatologic disease have been obtained to date. There is also a possibility of a hypercoagulable state given the RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on the head MRI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is not clearly explained, but it may be due to bronchospasm with a history of asthma. The examination improved with steroids, suggesting that bronchospasm could be a contributing factor. The patient should continue pressure support ventilation (PSV), discontinue steroids, and monitor for bronchospasm.
2. Fevers: The patient continues to have fevers, but the source is unclear. Multiple cultures have been negative, except for yeast in urine/sputum. The patient should have steroids discontinued as previously mentioned, and further investigations such as checking T-cell subsets per ID to assess for potential immunodeficiency should be considered.
3. s/p MI: The patient had a myocardial infarction and underwent placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS) to the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient should continue aspirin, beta-blocker, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  No obvious cause, originally thought due to
   bronchospasm with hx of asthma.  Exam improved with steroids.
   Respiratory alkalosis is likely due to CNS process.
   - continue PSV
   - d/c steroids, monitor for bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies: most negative
   to date
   - appreciate ID input; have stopped vanc and aztreonam given lack of
   positive culture data.  would prefer to also d/c caspo and doxy.
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - extubation currently limited by mental status.  Unfortunately trach
   may be limited by requirement for plavix; will d/w IP & Thoracics
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.  Unclear source.  Multiple cx
   negative except yeast in urine/sputum.
   - d/c steroids as above
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - checking T-cell subsets per ID to assess for potential
   immunodeficiency
   - LP today
   - ? if ok to d/c caspo /doxy as above
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - repeat MRI shows expected evolution of infarcts, no new lesions
   - EEG c/w toxic metabolic encephalopathy
   - likely a component of uremia at this point
   - d/c haldol as no clear improvement
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Slightly lower today.  Will monitor.
   - ? if source is liver given normal alk phos, total bili.  Check CK,
   GGT.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine improving.  BUN likely contributing to mental
   status.
   - f/u C3, C4
   - f/u renal biopsy
   - appreciate renal input
   - guaiac given that BUN seems out of proportion to creatinine
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for
   many days.  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The overall picture suggests possible vasculitis due to persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, negative serologies for rheumatologic diseases have been observed so far. There are also concerns about a hypercoagulable state given the right coronary artery (RCA) thrombosis and multiple infarcts on the head MRI.

The patient's respiratory failure is currently being managed with pressure support ventilation (PSV). Bronchospasm was initially thought to be the cause, but steroids have improved the examination. Respiratory alkalosis is likely due to a central nervous system (CNS) process.

The patient's fevers continue, with an unclear source. Multiple cultures have been negative, except for yeast in the urine and sputum. Steroids have been discontinued, and further investigations such as a lumbar puncture (LP) and checking T-cell subsets are planned to assess for potential immunodeficiency.

Following a myocardial infarction (MI), the patient underwent placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) to the RCA. An echocardiogram showed inferolateral hypokinesis. The patient is currently on aspirin, beta-blocker, and Plavix. ACE inhibitors have been held due to renal failure.

The patient's altered mental status remains"

The patient continues to have daily fevers, but her Hct remains stable. She has allergies to sulfasalazine and an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics given were caspofungin at 10:04 PM and doxycycline at 8:00 AM.

The patient is on propofol infusion at 15 mcg/kg/min, as well as other ICU medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. She is also on other medications, but specific details are not provided in the note.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and neurological assessment. The patient's temperature is 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.8 Fahrenheit), heart rate is 93 beats per minute, blood pressure ranges from 121/82 to 135/96 mmHg, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient's height is 66 inches, central venous pressure is 18 mmHg, and total fluid intake is 662 mL, with 383 mL of it being intravenous fluids. Total output is 1410 mL, including 530 mL of urine output. Negative fluid balance is -748 mL, with negative drain output of -147 mL.

Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 586 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 44. The patient's partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 273.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic assessments. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels are within normal range. Sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels are also within normal range. Glucose level is elevated at 178 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated troponin-T, and elevated D-dimer levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient is on full code status and her disposition is not mentioned in the provided information."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure.  Initially intubated for multifocal pneumonia
   (now resolving) and bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly, however has persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   secondary to neurological impairment.  Was on steroids for
   bronchospasm, though not currently wheezing, so will stop steroids.
   Was on antibiotics to cover pneumonia, however will stop these given
   persistent daily fevers and no positive cultures.
   - d/c steroids for bronchospasm
   -continue standing and PRN nebs
   -plan for trach on Wednesday
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Patient continues to have daily fevers
   with no positive cultures except for yeast in multiple sites.  Given
   persistent fevers and no documented source, will stop steroids and
   antibiotics.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - d/c antibiotics, steroids
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   - follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   - f/u cultures
   - consider HIV test
   3.  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN.  Creatinine improving.  S/p Renal
   biopsy which was unrevealing. Given concurrent embolic stroke, elevated
   LFTs, MI at early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable, f/u C3,C4
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   4.  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and was on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done,
   unremarkable.  MRI head showed evolving infarcts.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated

   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   Stably elevated LFTs.  This was iInitially thought
   to be secondary for zosyn but given her multi-organ failure, there is
   concern for infarcts secondary to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious
   source for emboli
 TEE negative) versus secondary to tylenol. RUQ U/S
   unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   9.       Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass.  Planned to have
   PEG at time of trach however her complicated anatomy will make this
   difficult.  Likely will continue tube feeds for now.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, admitted for NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. She has several ongoing medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for multifocal pneumonia and bronchospasm. Although her pneumonia is resolving, she still exhibits respiratory alkalosis likely due to neurological impairment. Steroids were previously used for bronchospasm but have been stopped. Antibiotics have also been stopped due to persistent daily fevers without positive cultures. A plan for tracheostomy on Wednesday has been made.

2. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient continues to experience daily fevers with no documented source. There is yeast present in multiple sites, but no positive cultures except for yeast. Due to the persistent fevers, steroids and antibiotics have been discontinued. Further investigations are planned to determine the underlying cause, including checking a T-cell subset panel to rule out immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is suspected to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Creatinine levels are improving, and a renal biopsy was performed but showed no significant findings. Given the concurrent embolic stroke, elevated liver enzymes, and history of myocardial infarction at an early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis exists. Renal follow-up and"

   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  No obvious cause, originally thought due to
   bronchospasm with hx of asthma.  Had pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and
   chest CT but improved at this point.  Respiratory alkalosis is likely
   due to CNS process.
   - continue PSV
   - off steroids, no evidence of bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies: most negative
   to date
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - extubation currently limited by mental status; trach tomorrow
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.  Unclear source.  Multiple cx
   negative except yeast in urine/sputum.
   - d/c steroids as above
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - CD4 count relatively normal, lymphocyte percentage likely low due to
   steroids
   - discussed LP with ID, but they feel low yield as unlikely to be acute
   or chronic meningitis

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process although no studies have been
   revealing thus far.
   1. Respiratory failure.  Initially intubated for multifocal pneumonia
   (now resolving) and bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly, however has persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   secondary to neurological impairment.  Was on steroids for
   bronchospasm, though not currently wheezing, so will stop steroids.
   Was on antibiotics to cover pneumonia, however will stop these given
   persistent daily fevers and no positive cultures.
   - d/c steroids for bronchospasm
   -continue standing and PRN nebs
   -plan for trach on Wednesday
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Patient continues to have daily fevers
   with no positive cultures except for yeast in multiple sites.  Given
   persistent fevers and no documented source, will stop steroids and
   antibiotics.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - d/c antibiotics, steroids
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   - follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   - f/u cultures
   - consider HIV test
   3.  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN.  Creatinine improving.  S/p Renal
   biopsy which was unrevealing. Given concurrent embolic stroke, elevated
   LFTs, MI at early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable, f/u C3,C4
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   4.  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and was on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done,
   unremarkable.  MRI head showed evolving infarcts.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   .
   5.       Rising BUN.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to occult GI bleed, steroid use,
   versus renal failure.
   -          f/u stool guiaic
   .
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   Stably elevated LFTs.  This was iInitially thought
   to be secondary for zosyn but given her multi-organ failure, there is
   concern for infarcts secondary to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious
   source for emboli
 TEE negative) versus secondary to tylenol. RUQ U/S
   unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   9.       Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass.  Planned to have
   PEG at time of trach however her complicated anatomy will make this
   difficult.  Likely will continue tube feeds for now.
   - tube feeds
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  No obvious cause, originally thought due to
   bronchospasm with hx of asthma.  Had pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and
   chest CT but improved at this point.  Respiratory alkalosis is likely
   due to CNS process.
   - continue PSV
   - off steroids, no evidence of bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies: most negative
   to date
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - extubation currently limited by mental status; trach tomorrow
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.  Unclear source.  Multiple cx
   negative except yeast in urine/sputum.
   - d/c steroids as above
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - CD4 count relatively normal, lymphocyte percentage likely low due to
   steroids
   - discussed LP with ID, but they feel low yield as unlikely to be acute
   or chronic meningitis
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - repeat MRI shows expected evolution of infarcts, no new lesions
   - EEG c/w toxic metabolic encephalopathy
   - likely a component of uremia at this point
   - d/c haldol as no clear improvement
   - wean propofol tomorrow after trach
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Slightly lower today.  Will monitor.
   - ? if source is liver given normal alk phos, total bili.  Check CK,
   GGT.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine improving.  BUN likely contributing to mental
   status.
   - f/u C3, C4
   - f/u renal biopsy (preliminary results unremarkable)
   - appreciate renal input
   - guaiac given that BUN seems out of proportion to creatinine
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for
   many days.  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and potential complications. These include:

1. NSTEMI (Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction): The patient had a myocardial infarction with 100% occlusion of the distal RCA (right coronary artery). They are currently on aspirin, Plavix, and a beta-blocker.

2. CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident): The patient experienced an embolic stroke, which is indicated by changes seen on head MRI.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and the creatinine level is improving. A renal biopsy was performed but was unremarkable. There is concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.

4. Altered mental status: The etiology for altered mental status is unclear, but it is likely multifactorial. Possible causes include embolic stroke, prolonged ICU stay, high-dose steroid use, and rising BUN.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for multifocal pneumonia and bronchospasm. Although the pneumonia is now resolving, the patient still has respiratory alkalosis likely due to a CNS process.

6. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient continues to have daily fevers with no positive cultures except for yeast in multiple sites. This may indicate an underlying infection or systemic inflammatory response.

7. Transaminitis: The patient has stable elevations in liver"

   CXR: Improved from yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process although no studies have been
   revealing thus far.
   1.Fevers of unknown origin.  Fever curve decreasing until spike this
   AM. Patient now off all antibiotics and also off steroids. No source
   for infection except for yeast cultured from multiple sites, but
   patient not found to be immunocompromised. Thorough imaging and studies
   sent off which have been unrevealing
 Utility of LP discussed with ID
   who felt this would be low yield. Continued fevers could be [**12-29**] central
   process/damage leading to temperature dysregulation
   - continue holding all antibiotics and steroids and follow fever curve
   - panculture today, f/u culture data
   - send hypercoagulability workup, f/u on vasculitis workup
   2. Respiratory failure. Has been intubated for about 2 weeks, plan to
   place trach tomorrow by thoracic surgery. CXR looks improved even off
   antibiotics and steroids. Unclear if component of persistent
   respiratory alkalosis is [**12-29**] neurologic impairment

   3  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations) which are slowly evolving.
   Patient with agitation and only limited movement on left side when
   sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done, unremarkable.  MRI
   head showed evolving infarcts. [**Month (only) 8**] be able to better evaluate mental
   status when propofol can be further weaned after trach placement.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated, may be able to titrate sedation off
   after trach placed and endotracheal tube removed. After this, will
   reassess patient

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, admitted for NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF. She has been intubated for about 2 weeks and will have a tracheostomy placement tomorrow. The patient has been experiencing fevers of unknown origin, respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, rising BUN, NSTEMI, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, and nutrition concerns due to gastric bypass surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient continues to have fevers despite being off all antibiotics and steroids. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for about 2 weeks and has shown improvement on the chest X-ray even without antibiotics and steroids. A tracheostomy will be performed tomorrow, and tube feeds will be stopped today after midnight. Daily chest X-rays will be followed.

3. Altered mental status: The etiology of the altered mental status is unclear, but it is likely multifactorial. The patient has had an embolic stroke, neurologic impairment, and evolving infarcts on MRI. Weaning of sedation will be continued as tolerated.

4. Renal failure: The patient is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Creatinine levels are improving/stable overnight"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure.  Initially intubated for multifocal pneumonia
   (now resolving) and bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly, however has persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   secondary to neurological impairment.  Was on steroids for
   bronchospasm, though not currently wheezing, so will stop steroids.
   Was on antibiotics to cover pneumonia, however will stop these given
   persistent daily fevers and no positive cultures.
   - d/c steroids for bronchospasm
   -continue standing and PRN nebs
   -plan for trach on Wednesday
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Patient continues to have daily fevers
   with no positive cultures except for yeast in multiple sites.  Given
   persistent fevers and no documented source, will stop steroids and
   antibiotics.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - d/c antibiotics, steroids
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   - follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   - f/u cultures
   - consider HIV test
   3.  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN.  Creatinine improving.  S/p Renal
   biopsy which was unrevealing. Given concurrent embolic stroke, elevated
   LFTs, MI at early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable, f/u C3,C4
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   4.  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and was on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done,
   unremarkable.  MRI head showed evolving infarcts.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   .
   5.       Rising BUN.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to occult GI bleed, steroid use,
   versus renal failure.
   -          f/u stool guiaic
   .
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   Stably elevated LFTs.  This was iInitially thought
   to be secondary for zosyn but given her multi-organ failure, there is
   concern for infarcts secondary to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious
   source for emboli
 TEE negative) versus secondary to tylenol. RUQ U/S
   unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   9.       Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass.  Planned to have
   PEG at time of trach however her complicated anatomy will make this
   difficult.  Likely will continue tube feeds for now.

","The patient's chief complaint is NSTEMI, CVA (stroke), and renal failure. The patient has been evaluated by a thoracic physician who will perform a bronchoscopy on Wednesday. Due to difficult anatomy resulting from gastric bypass surgery, the patient will not receive a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) at that time. The patient continues to have daily fevers.

Allergies include sulfasalazine and an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics were caspofungin at 10:04 PM and doxycycline at 08:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving propofol infusion at 15 mcg/kg/min, as well as other ICU medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data as of [2193-8-6] 07:12 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and various laboratory results.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated, sedated, and has a cardiac rate and rhythm of regular sinus rhythm. The pulmonary examination shows clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezes or crackles. The cardiovascular examination reveals regular heart sounds with no murmurs or gallops. The abdominal examination is significant for obesity and the presence of bowel sounds. There is no peripheral edema noted.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process.
   1. Respiratory failure.  Initially intubated for multifocal pneumonia
   (now resolving) and bronchospasm. Overall, CXR is improving
   significantly, however has persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   secondary to neurological impairment.  Was on steroids for
   bronchospasm, though not currently wheezing, so will stop steroids.
   Was on antibiotics to cover pneumonia, however will stop these given
   persistent daily fevers and no positive cultures.
   - d/c steroids for bronchospasm
   -continue standing and PRN nebs
   -plan for trach on Wednesday
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Patient continues to have daily fevers
   with no positive cultures except for yeast in multiple sites.  Given
   persistent fevers and no documented source, will stop steroids and
   antibiotics.
   - ID and rheum following, appreciate recs
   - d/c antibiotics, steroids
   - check T cell subset panel to r/o immunodeficiency  or autoimmune
   disease
   - follow up hypercoagulability workup, (lupus, ACA)
 so far negative
   - f/u cultures
   - consider HIV test
   3.  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN.  Creatinine improving.  S/p Renal
   biopsy which was unrevealing. Given concurrent embolic stroke, elevated
   LFTs, MI at early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus vasculitis.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable, f/u C3,C4
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   4.  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations).  Patient also has rising
   BUN in setting of renal failure.  Patient also has had prolonged ICU
   stay and was on high dose steroids.  Patient has only limited movement
   on left side when sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done,
   unremarkable.  MRI head showed evolving infarcts.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated
   .
   5.       Rising BUN.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to occult GI bleed, steroid use,
   versus renal failure.
   -          f/u stool guiaic
   .
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -continue hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   Stably elevated LFTs.  This was iInitially thought
   to be secondary for zosyn but given her multi-organ failure, there is
   concern for infarcts secondary to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious
   source for emboli
 TEE negative) versus secondary to tylenol. RUQ U/S
   unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   9.       Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass.  Planned to have
   PEG at time of trach however her complicated anatomy will make this
   difficult.  Likely will continue tube feeds for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include NSTEMI, CVA (stroke), and renal failure. The patient has been evaluated by Thoracics and will undergo a bronchoscopy on Wednesday. Due to difficult anatomy resulting from her history of gastric bypass, the patient will not receive PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) at that time.

The patient continues to have daily fevers, but no positive cultures except for yeast in multiple sites. The patient's Hct (hematocrit) remains stable. Allergies are documented as sulfasalazine and unknown. The last doses of antibiotics were Caspofungin at 10:04 PM and Doxycycline at 08:00 AM.

The patient is currently on several infusions and medications, including Propofol at 15 mcg/kg/min for sedation, Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and flow sheet data.

Vital signs include a maximum temperature (Tmax) of 38.2°C (100.8°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate (HR) of 93 bpm with a range of 84-96 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 121/82 mmHg to 135/96 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of"

   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  No obvious cause, originally thought due to
   bronchospasm with hx of asthma.  Had pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and
   chest CT but improved at this point.  Respiratory alkalosis is likely
   due to CNS process.
   - continue PSV
   - off steroids, no evidence of bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies: most negative
   to date
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - extubation currently limited by mental status; trach tomorrow
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.  Unclear source.  Multiple cx
   negative except yeast in urine/sputum.
   - d/c steroids as above
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - CD4 count relatively normal, lymphocyte percentage likely low due to
   steroids
   - discussed LP with ID, but they feel low yield as unlikely to be acute
   or chronic meningitis
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - repeat MRI shows expected evolution of infarcts, no new lesions
   - EEG c/w toxic metabolic encephalopathy
   - likely a component of uremia at this point
   - d/c haldol as no clear improvement
   - wean propofol tomorrow after trach
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Slightly lower today.  Will monitor.
   - ? if source is liver given normal alk phos, total bili.  Check CK,
   GGT.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine improving.  BUN likely contributing to mental
   status.
   - f/u C3, C4
   - f/u renal biopsy (preliminary results unremarkable)
   - appreciate renal input
   - guaiac given that BUN seems out of proportion to creatinine
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for
   many days.  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction). The patient's course has been complicated by persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, multiple serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date. Additionally, there is a possibility of a hypercoagulable state given the right coronary artery (RCA) thrombosis and multiple infarcts on head MRI.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, fevers, altered mental status, post-myocardial infarction (MI), and elevated LFTs. The respiratory failure is currently being managed with pressure support ventilation (PSV), and the patient is being weaned off steroids. The source of the fevers remains unclear, and multiple cultures have been negative except for yeast in the urine and sputum.

The patient has a history of bronchospasm with asthma but has improved at this point. There are no obvious causes for the respiratory failure, and the patient's mental status is limited by their condition. The patient is scheduled for a tracheostomy tomorrow.

In terms of post-MI management, the patient has undergone balloon angioplasty to the RCA, and an echocardiogram showed inferol"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  No obvious cause, originally thought due to
   bronchospasm with hx of asthma.  Had pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and
   chest CT but improved at this point.  Respiratory alkalosis is likely
   due to CNS process.
   - continue PSV
   - off steroids, no evidence of bronchospasm
   - f/u multiple rheumatologic and infectious serologies: most negative
   to date
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - extubation currently limited by mental status; trach tomorrow
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile.  Unclear source.  Multiple cx
   negative except yeast in urine/sputum.
   - d/c steroids as above
   - no endocarditis on TEE
   - CD4 count relatively normal, lymphocyte percentage likely low due to
   steroids
   - discussed LP with ID, but they feel low yield as unlikely to be acute
   or chronic meningitis
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - repeat MRI shows expected evolution of infarcts, no new lesions
   - EEG c/w toxic metabolic encephalopathy
   - likely a component of uremia at this point
   - d/c haldol as no clear improvement
   - wean propofol tomorrow after trach
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Slightly lower today.  Will monitor.
   - ? if source is liver given normal alk phos, total bili.  Check CK,
   GGT.
   6. ARF:  Creatinine improving.  BUN likely contributing to mental
   status.
   - f/u C3, C4
   - f/u renal biopsy (preliminary results unremarkable)
   - appreciate renal input
   - guaiac given that BUN seems out of proportion to creatinine
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for
   many days.  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She has been experiencing persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. These symptoms suggest a possible vasculitis or hypercoagulable state, as indicated by the RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on the head MRI. 

The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but she is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status. Her chest X-ray (CXR) and chest CT show improvement, but she will require a tracheostomy tomorrow for extubation. 

The source of her fevers remains unclear, with multiple cultures negative except for yeast in the urine/sputum. A lumbar puncture (LP) is not recommended as it is unlikely to be acute or chronic meningitis. 

The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent (BMS) placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). An echocardiogram showed inferolateral hypokinesis. She is currently on aspirin, beta-blocker, and Plavix. 

The cause of her altered mental status is still unclear, with a normal transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) ruling out vegetations. An EEG indicates toxic metabolic encephalopathy, and it is likely a component of"

   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process with plan to OR for trach placement
   today.
   1. Respiratory failure. Has been intubated for about 2 weeks, plan to
   place trach today by thoracic surgery. Typed and crossed 1 unit. Has
   been NPO, tube feeds stopped after midnight last night. Unclear if
   component of persistent respiratory alkalosis is [**12-29**] neurologic
   impairment
   - plan for trach today and see respiratory status with trach
   - follow daily CXR

   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Still with low grade fever (Tmax 101.9 at
   4pm, was pan-cultured yesterday showing leuks and bacteria in urine,
   sputum culture prelim shows 4+ GNR and diplococci). Patient still off
   all antibiotics and also off steroids. No source for infection except
   for yeast cultured from multiple sites, but patient not found to be
   immunocompromised. Thorough imaging and studies sent off which have
   been unrevealing
 Utility of LP discussed with ID who felt this would
   be low yield. Continued fevers could be [**12-29**] central process/damage

   3  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations) which are slowly evolving.
   Patient with agitation and only limited movement on left side when
   sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done, unremarkable.  MRI
   head showed evolving infarcts. [**Month (only) 8**] be able to better evaluate mental
   status when propofol can be further weaned after trach placement.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated, may be able to titrate sedation off
   after trach placed and endotracheal tube removed. After this, will
   reassess patient
s mental status after sedation
   4  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN.  Creatinine improved to 1.6.  S/p
   Renal biopsy which was unrevealing. Given concurrent embolic stroke,
   elevated LFTs, MI at early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus
   vasculitis.  C3/4 wnl.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479] is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. She has been intubated for about two weeks and is planned for tracheostomy placement today. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, fevers of unknown origin, altered mental status, renal failure, rising BUN, NSTEMI, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, and nutrition issues. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for two weeks and is planned for tracheostomy placement. Tracheostomy can improve ventilation and weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, there is a risk of postoperative complications such as bleeding, infection, or damage to the trachea or surrounding structures.

2. Fevers of unknown origin: Despite being off all antibiotics and steroids, the patient continues to have low-grade fever. This could indicate a central process or damage leading to temperature dysregulation. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.

3. Altered mental status: The etiology of AMS is unclear, but it is likely multifactorial. The patient has an evolving infarct on MRI and a history of embolic stroke. Neurological follow-up is essential to assess and manage the patient's mental status.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process with plan to OR for trach placement
   today.
   1. Respiratory failure. Has been intubated for about 2 weeks, plan to
   place trach today by thoracic surgery. Typed and crossed 1 unit. Has
   been NPO, tube feeds stopped after midnight last night. Unclear if
   component of persistent respiratory alkalosis is [**12-29**] neurologic
   impairment but patient continues to be tachypneic with periods of
   apnea. Has the 4+ GNR/diplococci growing out of sputum cx
   - plan for trach today and see respiratory status with trach
   - restart pt on aztreonam to cover gram negatives
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Still with low grade fever (Tmax 101.9 at
   4pm, was pan-cultured yesterday showing leuks and bacteria in urine,
   sputum culture prelim shows 4+ GNR and diplococci).  Her low grade
   fever is of unknown etiology but possible with central component. The
   increased fever spikes may be [**12-29**] the gram negatives in sputum.
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - restart aztreonam for gram negative coverage, appreciate ID recs on
   abx coverage
   - f/u culture data
   - send hypercoagulability workup, f/u on vasculitis workup
   3  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations) which are slowly
   evolving.  Neuro following and EEG done, unremarkable.  MRI head showed
   evolving infarcts. [**Month (only) 8**] be able to better evaluate mental status when
   propofol can be further weaned after trach placement. Also could be
   component of high BUN, which we can try to correct with aggressive
   fluid hydration.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated, may be able to titrate sedation off
   after trach placed and endotracheal tube removed. After this, will
   reassess patient
s mental status after sedation
   4. Rising BUN.  Patient found to be occult guiac positive, BUN
   increased out of proportion to Cr.
   - Consider aggressive fluid hydration to improve renal flow in effort
   to decreased BUN
   .
   5.  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN.  Creatinine improved to 1.6.  S/p
   Renal biopsy which was unrevealing. Given concurrent embolic stroke,
   elevated LFTs, MI at early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus
   vasculitis.  C3/4 wnl.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   .
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Troponin trending downwards
   but overnight CK doubled to 1400s.
   -add on troponin, check EKG to r/o new ischemic event
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -f/u hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   Trending down.  No evidence of liver injury, but
   may be related to muscle injury with increased CK. Tbili has always
   been wnl. GGT pending. RUQ US unremarkable
   -continue to monitor, f/u GGT
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   glucose well controlled overnight

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44-year-old female with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF without a clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and embolic process. The patient is currently intubated for about two weeks and is planned to undergo tracheostomy placement today. She has been NPO, and tube feeds were stopped after midnight last night. The patient's respiratory status is tachypneic with periods of apnea, and she has 4+ GNR/diplococci growing out of sputum culture. The plan is to restart the patient on aztreonam to cover gram-negative bacteria, follow daily chest X-ray, and continue nebulizers as needed.

The patient's fever spikes may be related to gram-negative bacteria in the sputum. The ID team is following up, and the patient will be restarted on aztreonam for gram-negative coverage. The hypercoagulability workup and vasculitis workup are pending.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing a fever spike to 101.5°F. The patient's tube feeds were stopped at midnight for tracheostomy placement. Blood cultures were taken, and urine, sputum, and stool cultures are pending. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfasalazine and unknown allergies. The patient received caspofungin and doxycycline, but both medications were discontinued on the 4th and 5th of August, respectively.

The patient is receiving propofol infusion and various other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the fever spike. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/64 mmHg to 136/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,361 mL since midnight and an output of 1,745 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 384 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 422 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI)"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process with plan to OR for trach placement
   today.
   1. Respiratory failure. Has been intubated for about 2 weeks, plan to
   place trach today by thoracic surgery. Typed and crossed 1 unit. Has
   been NPO, tube feeds stopped after midnight last night. Unclear if
   component of persistent respiratory alkalosis is [**12-29**] neurologic
   impairment
   - plan for trach today and see respiratory status with trach
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   2.Fevers of unknown origin.  Still with low grade fever (Tmax 101.9 at
   4pm, was pan-cultured yesterday showing leuks and bacteria in urine).
   Patient still off all antibiotics and also off steroids. No source for
   infection except for yeast cultured from multiple sites, but patient
   not found to be immunocompromised. Thorough imaging and studies sent
   off which have been unrevealing
 Utility of LP discussed with ID who
   felt this would be low yield. Continued fevers could be [**12-29**] central
   process/damage leading to temperature dysregulation
   - continue holding all antibiotics and steroids and follow fever curve

   - send hypercoagulability workup, f/u on vasculitis workup
   3  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations) which are slowly evolving.
   Patient with agitation and only limited movement on left side when
   sedation is weaned.  Neuro following and EEG done, unremarkable.  MRI
   head showed evolving infarcts. [**Month (only) 8**] be able to better evaluate mental
   status when propofol can be further weaned after trach placement.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated, may be able to titrate sedation off
   after trach placed and endotracheal tube removed. After this, will
   reassess patient

   4  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN.  Creatinine improved to 1.6.  S/p
   Renal biopsy which was unrevealing. Given concurrent embolic stroke,
   elevated LFTs, MI at early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus

   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -f/u hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   Stably elevated LFTs.  This was iInitially thought
   to be secondary for zosyn but given her multi-organ failure, there is
   concern for infarcts secondary to thrombus or emboli (though no obvious
   source for emboli
 TEE negative) versus secondary to tylenol. RUQ U/S
   unremarkable.  Transaminitis is stable.
   -continue to monitor
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Last Name 479] is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF without a clear unifying diagnosis. She is currently intubated for about two weeks, and a tracheostomy is planned today. The patient has been NPO, with tube feeds stopped after midnight last night. There is uncertainty about the persistent respiratory alkalosis being a component of neurologic impairment.

The patient's fever curve showed a spike to 101.5 AM of [**8-6**]. Blood cultures were drawn at [**2193-8-6**] 10:30 AM, urine culture at the same time, and sputum culture at [**2193-8-6**] 11:00 AM. The patient's temperature is currently 101.9. Allergies include sulfasalazine, with the last dose of antibiotics being caspofungin on [**2193-8-4**] 10:04 PM and doxycycline on [**2193-8-5**] 08:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.9°F), blood pressure of 104/64 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479] is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF without clear unifying diagnosis. She has been intubated for about two weeks and is now planned to have a tracheostomy tomorrow by thoracic surgery. The patient's fever curve showed a spike this morning, and she has been off all antibiotics and steroids. The source of infection is still unclear, but yeast was cultured from multiple sites. Imaging and studies have been unrevealing, and a lumbar puncture was discussed but felt to be low yield. The patient also has respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, rising BUN, NSTEMI, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, and complications from gastric bypass surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers of unknown origin: The patient's fever curve showed a spike this morning despite being off all antibiotics and steroids. The source of infection is still unclear, and further cultures and workup are needed to determine the cause.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for about two weeks, and a tracheostomy is planned tomorrow. Continued respiratory support and close monitoring of daily CXR are recommended.
3. Altered mental status: The etiology for AMS is unclear, and it is likely multifactorial. Neurological evaluation and follow-up are important, especially after"

   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  No obvious cause, originally thought due to
   bronchospasm with hx of asthma.  Had pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and
   chest CT but improved at this point.  Respiratory alkalosis is likely
   due to CNS process.
   - continue PSV.  Wean down to 5/5 if tolerated although as above,
   neurologic process appears to be driving an elevated minute
   ventilation.
   - off steroids, no evidence of bronchospasm
   - cont albuterol/atrovent
   - extubation currently limited by mental status; trach today
   2. Fevers:  Continues to be febrile, now off antibiotics and steroids.
   Sputum cx yesterday with 4+ GNR and >25 PMNs.
   - start gram negative coverage (aztreonam), check CXR, f/u sputum cx
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - likely a component of uremia at this point
   - wean propofol after trach if possible
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Likely related to muscle breakdown as CK is also
   elevated.  Alk phos and total bili have been normal, arguing against
   liver source.
   - check GGT
   - check aldolase
   - ? polymyositis or dermatomyositis
   - could also have a component of rhabdo from propofol infusion syndrome
   (elevation in CK seems to trend with increase in propofol over last
   day)
   6. ARF:  Creatinine improving.  BUN likely contributing to mental
   status.
    - appreciate renal input
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  out of window for withdrawal, received benzos for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, fevers, elevated LFTs, and hypernatremia. The patient has been on multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, antiplatelet agents, and sedatives. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer levels, and troponin T levels. Imaging studies reveal pulmonary infiltrates. The patient's current assessment includes confusion, respiratory alkalosis, and possible hypercoagulable state. The plan is to continue positive pressure ventilation, wean sedatives, and perform a tracheostomy. The patient will also be started on gram-negative antibiotic coverage, and further investigations will be done to determine the cause of the altered mental status and elevated LFTs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to bronchospasm or a CNS process. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support will be continued, and the patient will be weaned off sedatives.
2. Fevers: The patient continues to have fevers despite being off antibiotics and steroids. A sputum culture yesterday showed 4+ G"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He was found unresponsive at home and intubated in the emergency department.

The patient underwent a tracheostomy last night without any complications. However, there was an error with restarting aztreonam antibiotics, so it was discontinued. The patient received a total of 2 liters of normal saline bolus, but there was no change in urine output.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/63 to 124/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal ventilation.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a weight loss from 92 kg at admission to 84.3 kg currently. The total fluid intake is 3,208 mL and total fluid output is 1,506 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,702 mL. The patient's urine output is 1,506 mL.

   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process with trach placed yesterday.
   1. Respiratory failure. Has been intubated for about 2 weeks, plan to
   place trach today by thoracic surgery. Typed and crossed 1 unit. Has
   been NPO, tube feeds stopped after midnight last night. Unclear if
   component of persistent respiratory alkalosis is [**12-29**] neurologic
   impairment but patient continues to be tachypneic with periods of
   apnea. Has the 4+ [**Month/Day (2) 634**]/diplococci growing out of sputum cx
   - plan for trach today and see respiratory status with trach
   - restart pt on aztreonam to cover gram negatives
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   2. Fevers of unknown origin.  Still with low grade fever (Tmax 101.9 at
   4pm, was pan-cultured yesterday showing leuks and bacteria in urine,
   sputum culture prelim shows 4+ [**Month/Day (2) 634**] and diplococci).  Her low grade
   fever is of unknown etiology but possible with central component. The
   increased fever spikes may be [**12-29**] the gram negatives in sputum.
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - restart aztreonam for gram negative coverage, appreciate ID recs on
   abx coverage
   - f/u culture data
   - send hypercoagulability workup, f/u on vasculitis workup
   3  Altered mental status.   Etiology for AMS is unclear, but likely
   multifactorial.  Head CT demonstrated embolic stroke versus septic
   emboli (though TEE negative for vegetations) which are slowly
   evolving.  Neuro following and EEG done, unremarkable.  MRI head showed
   evolving infarcts. [**Month (only) 8**] be able to better evaluate mental status when
   propofol can be further weaned after trach placement. Also could be
   component of high BUN, which we can try to correct with aggressive
   fluid hydration.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - lighten sedation as tolerated, may be able to titrate sedation off
   after trach placed and endotracheal tube removed. After this, will
   reassess patient
s mental status after sedation
   4. Rising BUN.  Patient found to be occult guiac positive, BUN
   increased out of proportion to Cr.
   - Consider aggressive fluid hydration to improve renal flow in effort
   to decreased BUN
   .
   5.  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN.  Creatinine improved to 1.6.  S/p
   Renal biopsy which was unrevealing. Given concurrent embolic stroke,
   elevated LFTs, MI at early age, concern for thrombus/infarct versus
   vasculitis.  C3/4 wnl.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - f/u results of renal biopsy : prelim is unremarkable
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   .
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Troponin trending downwards
   but overnight CK doubled to 1400s.
   -add on troponin, check EKG to r/o new ischemic event
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -f/u hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   Trending down.  No evidence of liver injury, but
   may be related to muscle injury with increased CK. Tbili has always
   been wnl. GGT pending. RUQ US unremarkable
   -continue to monitor, f/u GGT
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T levels. Other lab results indicate possible kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including respiratory failure, fevers of unknown origin, altered mental status, rising BUN, renal failure, NSTEMI, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, and nutrition issues related to her gastric bypass surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated for about two weeks, and there are concerns about persistent respiratory alkalosis possibly due to neurologic impairment."

The patient has a history of cough, tachypnea, and is receiving nutritional support through tube feeds. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/63 to 124/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and the patient's weight is currently 84.3 kg. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 18 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 3,208 mL and output of 1,506 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 436 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 24 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 240, ventilation (Ve) of 13.4 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 23.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 28.4% to 29.1%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 292 to 400 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 mg/dL, troponin-T levels ranging from 2.63 to 3.64 ng/mL, and other lab values within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and hospital-acquired infections due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines."

   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who was admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure (ARF). She has been diagnosed with several potential medical complications including a hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and an embolic process. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement yesterday and is tolerating the tracheal collar. 

The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, with persistent respiratory alkalosis likely due to a central process. She has been experiencing periods of apnea, and her RR has been in the range of 20-40 throughout her MICU stay. No indication of pneumonia is present, and the corrected lab report of sputum culture is negative for any growth. However, the CXR shows increased pulmonary edema following fluid administration yesterday. 

The patient's mental status is altered, and she is now off propofol to observe any changes in her mental status or improvement. The etiology of AMS is likely multifactorial, including resolving embolic process, uremia, and possibly resolving rhabdo. 

The patient also has fevers of unknown origin, which have resolved overnight. All newest blood cultures are negative, and the ID signed off yesterday. The patient received one dose of aztreonam but discontinued when gram-negative bacteria found in the sputum were identified as a lab error. 

Other ongoing issues include increased BUN"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**], a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, was admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure (ARF). The cause of her symptoms is unclear, but there is concern for a hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, or embolic process. She underwent tracheostomy placement yesterday and is currently on a tracheal collar.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] has persistent respiratory alkalosis, likely due to a central process. Her respiratory rate has been in the 20-40 range throughout her stay in the MICU, with periods of apnea. There is no indication of pneumonia, and her sputum culture shows oropharyngeal flora. Her chest X-ray shows increased pulmonary edema after a fluid load yesterday. She has trace wheezes today.
   - Follow ABG and respiratory status on tracheal collar.
   - IV lasix for diuresis, goal negative 1-2L overnight.
   - Follow daily chest X-ray.
   - Continue nebs prn.

2. Altered Mental Status: Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is now off propofol, and her mental status changes or improvement will be monitored. The etiology of her altered mental status is likely multifactor"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.  Her
   overall picture is confusing and perhaps suggestive of a vasculitis
   given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease.  However, multiple
   serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date.  Also, ? of
   a hypercoaguable state given RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on
   head MRI.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Currently tolerating trach collar.  Has
   persistent respiratory alkalosis which we feel is due to a CNS process.
   - attempt diuresis today
   - continue PSV.  Wean down to 5/5 if tolerated although as above,
   neurologic process appears to be driving an elevated minute
   ventilation.
   - off steroids, slightly wheezy today.  Cont MDIs.
   2. Fevers:  Fever curve significantly improved off antibiotics &
   steroids.  Cont to follow.
   3. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Echo with inferolateral hypokinesis.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   4. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - uremia is likely the primary cause of her somnolence at this point.
   BUN minimally improved today.
   - off propofol
   5. Elevated LFTs:  Likely related to muscle breakdown as CK is also
   elevated.  Alk phos and total bili have been normal, arguing against
   liver source.
   - GGT elevated so some component of this is hepatic
   -  aldolase pending
   6. ARF:  Creatinine improving.  BUN likely contributing to mental
   status.
    - appreciate renal input
   7. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.
   8. Elevated BUN: Seems out of proportion to her elevated creatinine.
   Now is guaiac positive.  Hct remains stable so doubt substantial GI
   bleed.  Likely some component of muscle breakdown from steroids +/-
   rhabdo.
   9. Hypernatremia:  Replete free water.  Check serial sodium.  Sodium
   improving.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with a history of NSTEMI. She has been experiencing persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia. The overall picture suggests a possible vasculitis given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, multiple serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative to date. There is also a question of a hypercoagulable state due to the right coronary artery (RCA) thrombosis and multiple infarcts on head MRI.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently tolerating the tracheostomy collar. She has persistent respiratory alkalosis which may be due to a CNS process. It is important to monitor her respiratory status closely and attempt diuresis today while continuing pressure support ventilation (PSV). Weaning down to 5/5 if tolerated is recommended, although the neurologic process appears to be driving an elevated minute ventilation.
2. Fevers: The fever curve has significantly improved off antibiotics and steroids. Continued monitoring is advised.
3. Post-myocardial infarction (s/p MI): The patient had a myocardial infarction and underwent stenting of the RCA. An echo revealed inferolateral hypokinesis. It is important to continue aspirin, beta-blocker, and Plavix. Holding ACE due"

- The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and urine eosinophilia.
- The overall picture suggests a possible vasculitis given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, multiple serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative.
- There is also a suspicion of a hypercoagulable state due to right coronary artery (RCA) thrombosis and multiple infarcts on head MRI.
- The patient recently underwent tracheostomy placement.
- Sputum culture revealed moderate OP flora, leading to discontinuation of aztreonam.
- The patient has respiratory failure, tolerating the tracheostomy collar, but with persistent respiratory alkalosis attributed to a central nervous system (CNS) process.
- The patient's fevers have significantly improved after stopping antibiotics and steroids.
- She has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) with a stent placed in the RCA. An echocardiogram showed inferolateral hypokinesis.
- The patient's altered mental status is unclear, with negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for vegetations and normal transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE).
- Elevated LFTs are likely related to muscle breakdown as creatine kinase (CK) is also elevated.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral
   ischemic event, altered mental status which remains unresponsive, with
   fevers of unknown origin now resolved, but no clear etiology for her
   continued poor mental status and ischemic event. Workup for
   hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, embolic process all negative so far.
   1. Respiratory failure. With persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay with
   periods of apnea.
   - place patient back on trach collar
   - follow ABG and respiratory status on trach collar
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   2. Altered mental status.
 Now patient is off propofol, will see how
   patient
s mental status changes or how much her mental status improves.
   Etiology of AMS is likely multifactorial
 with demonstrated resolving
   embolic process with component of uremia with high BUN which has
   worsened with attempted diuresis yesterday
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
 question whether her current
   mental status can be explained by her ischemic event or whether has
   brainstem injury.
   - follow neuro exam off sedation
   - attempt to work on fluid status to decrease BUN.  Talk with renal
   service regarding utility of possible dialysis to decrease uremia
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK
   3. Fevers of unknown origin.  Afebrile for 48 hours.  All newest blood
   cultures negative. ID signed off. Leukocytosis increased overnight but
   Afebrile
   - add on diff to white count
   - f/u fever curve, white count. No antibiotics
   - f/u culture data
   - send hypercoagulability workup, f/u on vasculitis workup
   4. Azotemia/fluid status.  Suspected ATN but unclear precipitant. No
   evidence of vasculitis on renal biopsy but question of possible
   microangiopathy on second look at biopsy however platelets normal.
   Patient with increased Cr, BUN yesterday with attempted diuresis with
   IV lasix with minimal response in increased urine output. Patient is
   total body overloaded but unclear whether is intravascularly depleted
   or overloaded. Concern for possible intravascular depletion with cold
   extremities, difficulty in palpating peripheral pulse
   - Trial of fluid bolus this AM and repeat afternoon lytes to see
   response in BUN/Cr
   - Talk to renal re: possibility of starting hemodialysis
   - Check smear for schistocytes
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   .
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -f/u hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT rending down.  GGT elevated at 343, could
   be [**12-29**] chronic liver dz or vasculitis. No signs of obstructive disease
   through hospital stay.
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   - f/u aldolase
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   glucose well controlled overnight
   9. h/o ETOH use: No evidence of withdrawal. Question of whether
   component of wernickes is possible contributant to mental status.
   - continue thiamine, folate, MVI
   10.Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass so no PEG planned
   currently
   - Continue tube feeds
   11. Hypernatremia:  Replete free water - will switch to IV as unclear
   how much she absorbs given her gastric bypass.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure (ARF) without clear etiology but concerning for hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and embolic process. She continues to be unresponsive despite being off sedation for 48 hours, with increased azotemia. The patient has shown poor urine output in response to diuretic therapy, cool extremities, and difficulty palpating peripheral pulses. She also has respiratory failure with persistent respiratory alkalosis likely due to a central process. Her altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including resolving embolic process, uremia, and possibly brainstem injury. The patient's fevers of unknown origin have resolved, but all blood cultures are negative. She has azotemia/fluid status concerns, suspected acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and a history of NSTEMI with inferolateral hypokinesis on echocardiogram. The patient's CK is rising, which could be due to rhabdomyolysis or ongoing ischemic event. She also has transaminitis with elevated GGT, hyperglycemia exacerbated by steroids, and a history of ethanol use without evidence of withdrawal. Additionally, the patient has hypernatremia, and nutrition concerns due to gastric bypass surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory alkalosis may progress to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may worsen if the underlying causes such as embolic process, uremia, or brainstem injury are not addressed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's ARF may deteriorate if fluid overload and azotemia are not effectively managed.
4. Fevers of Unknown Origin: Although the patient is currently afebrile, further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the previous fevers.
5. Hypercoagulable State: The patient's history of NSTEMI at a young age raises concerns for a hypercoagulable state, which may lead to further thrombotic events.
6. Vasculitis: The patient's vasculitis workup should be closely monitored, as untreated vasculitis can lead to organ damage.
7. Ischemic Events: The patient's rising CK levels suggest the possibility of ongoing ischemic event or rhabdomyolysis.
8. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes should be monitored, as they could indicate liver damage or chronic liver disease.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels should be controlled to prevent complications associated with hyperglycemia.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium imbalance should be corrected to avoid potential neurological complications.
11. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral
   ischemic event, altered mental status which remains unresponsive, with
   fevers of unknown origin now resolved, but no clear etiology for her
   continued poor mental status and ischemic event. Workup for
   hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, embolic process all negative so far.
   1. Respiratory failure. With persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay with
   periods of apnea.
   - place patient back on trach collar
   - follow ABG and respiratory status on trach collar
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   2. Altered mental status.
 Now patient is off propofol, will see how
   patient
s mental status changes or how much her mental status improves.
   Etiology of AMS is likely multifactorial
 with demonstrated resolving
   embolic process with component of uremia with high BUN which has
   worsened with attempted diuresis yesterday
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
 question whether her current
   mental status can be explained by her ischemic event or whether has
   brainstem injury.
   - follow neuro exam off sedation
   - attempt to work on fluid status to decrease BUN.  Talk with renal
   service regarding utility of possible dialysis to decrease uremia
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK
   3. Fevers of unknown origin.  Afebrile for 48 hours.  All newest blood
   cultures negative. ID signed off. Leukocytosis increased overnight but
   Afebrile
   - add on diff to white count
   - f/u fever curve, white count. No antibiotics
   - f/u culture data
   - send hypercoagulability workup, f/u on vasculitis workup
   4. Azotemia/fluid status.  Suspected ATN but unclear precipitant. No
   evidence of vasculitis on renal biopsy but question of possible
   microangiopathy on second look at biopsy however platelets normal.
   Patient with increased Cr, BUN yesterday with attempted diuresis with
   IV lasix with minimal response in increased urine output. Patient is
   total body overloaded but unclear whether is intravascularly depleted
   or overloaded. Concern for possible intravascular depletion with cold
   extremities, difficulty in palpating peripheral pulse
   - Trial of fluid bolus this AM and repeat afternoon lytes to see
   response in BUN/Cr
   - Talk to renal re: possibility of starting hemodialysis
   - Check smear for schistocytes
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   .
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -f/u hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT rending down.  GGT elevated at 343, could
   be [**12-29**] chronic liver dz or vasculitis. No signs of obstructive disease
   through hospital stay.
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   - f/u aldolase
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   glucose well controlled overnight
   9. h/o ETOH use: No evidence of withdrawal. Question of whether
   component of wernickes is possible contributant to mental status.
   - continue thiamine, folate, MVI
   10.Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass so no PEG planned
   currently
   - Continue tube feeds
   11. Hypernatremia:  Replete free water - will switch to IV as unclear
   how much she absorbs given her gastric bypass.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**], a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, was admitted with NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure (ARF) without a clear etiology but concerning for hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and embolic process. The patient remains unresponsive despite being off sedation for 48 hours, with increased azotemia. 

24-hour events include poor urine output after administration of lasix, cool extremities, rising BUN and creatinine levels, difficulty in getting arterial blood gas (ABG) due to tachypnea, and reinsertion of the arterial line. 

The patient's allergies include sulfasalazine, and she is on multiple medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, metoprolol, albuterol and ipratroprium nebs, aspirin, Plavix, SC heparin, folic acid, insulin sliding scale, lansoprazole, MVI, thiamine, and others. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 115/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated troponin-T levels, increased CK-MB levels"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple health concerns. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate 84 bpm, blood pressure 115/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 24 mmHg, indicating possible fluid overload. The patient's weight has decreased from 92 kg at admission to 84.3 kg.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 21 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 210, which suggests respiratory alkalosis and adequate oxygenation. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 358 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 24.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.2%, platelet count (Plt) of 400 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.2 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 2.63 ng/mL, and lactate level of 2.4 mmol"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, resolving
   multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and ARF
   without clear unifying diagnosis but concerning for hypercoagulable
   state, vasculitis, embolic process with trach placed yesterday.
   1. Respiratory failure. Now on trach collar and tolerating this. With
   persistent respiratory alkalosis likely [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has
   been 20-40s throughout MICU stay with periods of apnea. No indication
   of PNA and corrected lab report of spumtum Cx is oropharyngeal flora
   however CXR with increased pulm edema s/p fluid load yesterday.  Has
   trace wheezes today.
   - follow ABG and respiratory status on trach collar
   - IV lasix for diuresis, goal negative 1-2L overnight
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   2.Altered mental status.
 Now patient is off propofol, will see how
   patient
s mental status changes or how much her mental status improves.
   Etiology of AMS is likely multifactorial
 with demonstrated resolving
   embolic process with component of uremia with high BUN vs possible
   resolving rhabdo.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - follow neuro exam off sedation
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK
   - plan to meet with family today to discuss prognosis
   3. Fevers of unknown origin.  Afebrile overnight.  All newest blood
   cultures negative. ID signed off yesterday. Patient given one dose of
   aztreonam yesterday but discontinued when gram negatives in sputum were
   found to be lab error.
   - f/u fever curve, white count. No antibiotics
   - f/u culture data
   - send hypercoagulability workup, f/u on vasculitis workup
   4. Increased BUN.  Secondary to prior steroid therapy, occult GIB.
   Trending downwards overnight.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   5.  Renal failure.  Suspected ATN per renal. [**Month (only) 8**] also be component of
   resolving rhabdo with high CK. Cr improved overnight.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   .
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup yesterday negative for
   new ischemic event. Troponin trending down.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -f/u hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT rending down.  GGT elevated at 343, could
   be [**12-29**] chronic liver dz or vasculitis. No signs of obstructive disease
   through hospital stay.
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   glucose well controlled overnight
   9.Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass so no PEG planned currently
   - Continue tube feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, NSTEMI, resolving multifocal pneumonia, embolic stroke, altered mental status, and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient was admitted with respiratory failure and is now on a tracheostomy collar, tolerating it well.
- She has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including resolving embolic process, uremia, and possibly resolving rhabdomyolysis.
- The patient has fevers of unknown origin, which were resolved overnight. Blood cultures are negative, and antibiotics have been discontinued.
- Her BUN levels are increased, secondary to prior steroid therapy and occult gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient has renal failure, suspected to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to renal dosing of medications and high CK levels.
- She had an NSTEMI, which was treated with placement of two bare-metal stents in the distal RCA. There is concern for a hypercoagulable state.
- The patient has transaminitis, with AST and ALT levels trending down. GGT levels are elevated, possibly due to chronic liver disease or vasculitis.
- Her blood glucose levels were exacerbated by steroids but are now well-controlled.
- Due to the patient's history of gastric bypass, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) is not planned at this time.
- The patient has a central"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient has been receiving lasix for poor urine output, but their BUN and creatinine levels continued to rise. They were given a fluid bolus three times due to cool extremities and rising BUN and Cr levels.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfasalazine and unknown antibiotics. They are currently on various medications including furosemide (Lasix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/80 to 122/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on ventilatory support with a tracheostomy mask, using a standby mode ventilator.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,747 mL and output of 645 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,102 mL. The patient has received a total of 500 cc fluid boluses three times.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (24.8 K/uL), hematocrit (29.2%), platelet count (400 K/uL), troponin-T (2.63 ng/mL), and CK-MB"

   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by persistent fevers,
   altered mental status, elevated LFTs, and urine eosinophilia.
   Vasculitis workup has been negative to date.  Now afebrile & off of
   antibiotics, with worsening renal failure and persistently altered
   mental status.
   1. Respiratory failure:  Placed on PSV earlier this AM for tachypnea,
   but respiratory rate appears unchanged over past 10 days.  Will try
   trach collar again today.
    - trach collar today, repeat VBG
    - cont albuterol and atrovent
   2. s/p MI:  s/p BMS to RCA.  Most recent echo with preserved EF.
    - cont aspirin, beta-blocker, plavix
    - holding ace given renal failure
   3. Altered mental status:  Unclear cause of findings on MRI.  TTE
   negative, TEE negative for vegetations.
   - uremia is likely the primary cause of her somnolence at this point
   - off propofol
   - CK continuing to rise of unclear etiology - will discuss ?myopathy
   with neuro
    4. Elevated LFTs:  Likely related to muscle breakdown as CK is also
   elevated.  Alk phos and total bili have been normal.
   - GGT elevated so some component of this is hepatic
   -  aldolase pending
   5. ARF:  BUN and creatinine continue to rise and seemed to worsen with
   the administration of lasix despite not effectively diuresing.  This
   suggests that she is somewhat volume depleted although for LOS is
   likely extremely positive.  Will give additional IVF today but wonder
   if she would benefit from dialysis given ? of BUN contributing to
   mental status.
   6. ? Hx EtOH abuse:  Cont thiamine, folate, mvt.  Will d/w Neuro
   whether any of this could be Wernicke's.
   7. Leukocytosis:  Has been persistent but worsened today.  Afebrile.
   Will add on differential.  No abx for now, f/u cx.
   8. Hypernatremia:  Replete free water - will switch to IV as unclear
   how much she absorbs given her gastric bypass.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests, and urine eosinophilia. The overall picture is confusing and suggestive of vasculitis given the persistent fevers and multisystem disease. However, multiple serologies for rheumatologic disease are negative. The patient also has a history of suspected hypercoagulable state due to RCA thrombosis and multiple infarcts on head MRI.

24-hour events:
- Arterial line stopped at 01:00 PM
- Diuresis attempted yesterday with Lasix 40 IV and then 80 IV without response in UOP. Then got NS 500 cc boluses x3.
- Patient appeared more tachypneic this morning, so placed back on ventilator.
- Allergies: Sulfasalazine, unknown.
- Last dose of antibiotics: Aztreonam at 12:00 PM.
- Infusions: Furosemide (Lasix) at 02:14 PM, Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) at 12:37 AM.
- Other medications: Lansoprazole, insulin sliding scale, peridex, Plavix, thiamine, folate, multivitamin, atrovent, aspirin 325 mg daily, metoprolol (held this AM), albuterol, free water 250 q3h.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who was admitted with NSTEMI. She has experienced persistent fevers, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests, and urine eosinophilia. The overall clinical picture suggests a possible vasculitis, but multiple serologies for rheumatologic disease have been negative. The patient also has a history of hypercoagulable state indicated by a thrombosis in the right coronary artery and multiple infarcts on head MRI.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has continued to deteriorate. She attempted diuresis yesterday without success, resulting in rising BUN and creatinine levels. She received multiple NS boluses but remains tachypneic, leading to the decision to place her back on the ventilator. The patient's respiratory status has been unchanged over the past 10 days.

The patient's altered mental status persists, and it is unclear whether this is due to uremia or other causes. Her liver function tests remain elevated, with a particular increase in GGT. Her renal function has worsened, and there are concerns about the need for dialysis.

Other findings include leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and potential ethanol abuse. The patient is critically ill, and the medical team is considering various interventions to address her multiple organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate remains unchanged over the past 10 days, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral
   ischemic event, altered mental status which remains unresponsive, with
   fevers of unknown origin now resolved, but no clear etiology for her
   continued poor mental status and ischemic event. Workup for
   hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, embolic process all negative so far.
   1. Respiratory failure. With persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay with
   periods of apnea.  Was put back on vent last PM for desat to 70s (?
   Mucous plug).  Now doing well.
   - wean back to trach collar if able
   - follow ABG and respiratory status on trach collar
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   -diurese if able (lasix/diuril)
   2. Altered mental status.
No improvement in mental status off
   sedation. Etiology of AMS is likely multifactorial
 with demonstrated
   resolving embolic process with component of uremia with high BUN which
   has worsened with attempted diuresis yesterday.  Concerning for brain
   stem injury, but not seen on MRI.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
 question whether her current
   mental status can be explained by her ischemic event or whether has
   brainstem injury.
   - follow neuro exam off sedation
   - attempt to work on fluid status to decrease BUN
renal considering HD
   to improve uremia.
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK
   -f/u copper, zinc levels
   3. Fevers of unknown origin.  Afebrile for >48 hours.  All newest blood
   cultures negative. ID signed off. Leukocytosis increased overnight but
   Afebrile
   - add on diff to white count
   - f/u fever curve, white count. No antibiotics
   - f/u culture data
   - send hypercoagulability workup, f/u on vasculitis workup
   4. Azotemia/fluid status.  Suspected ATN but unclear precipitant. No
   evidence of vasculitis on renal biopsy but question of possible
   microangiopathy on second look at biopsy however platelets normal.
   Patient with increased Cr, BUN yesterday with attempted diuresis with
   IV lasix with minimal response in increased urine output. Patient is
   total body overloaded but unclear whether is intravascularly depleted
   or overloaded. Concern for possible intravascular depletion with cold
   extremities, difficulty in palpating peripheral pulse
   - Trial of lasix/diuril to diurese
   - Talk to renal re: possibility of starting hemodialysis
   - Check smear for schistocytes
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -f/u hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT rending down.  GGT elevated at 343, could
   be [**12-29**] chronic liver dz or vasculitis. No signs of obstructive disease
   through hospital stay.
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   - f/u aldolase
   -consider liver biopsy if persists thru weekend
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   glucose well controlled overnight
   9. h/o ETOH use: No evidence of withdrawal. Question of whether
   component of wernickes is possible contributant to mental status.
   - continue thiamine, folate, MVI
   10.Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass so no PEG planned
   currently
   - Continue tube feeds
   11. Hypernatremia:  Replete free water - will switch to IV as unclear
   how much she absorbs given her gastric bypass.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for central process causing respiratory failure. The plan includes weaning back to tracheostomy collar, following ABG and respiratory status, and performing daily chest X-rays.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has unresponsive altered mental status despite being off sedation. Etiologies such as uremia, brainstem injury, and ischemic event need to be considered. The plan includes neuro follow-up, monitoring the neuro exam off sedation, attempting to improve fluid status and decrease BUN to improve uremia, and considering hemodialysis.

3. Fevers of Unknown Origin: The patient had fevers of unknown origin, but is now afebrile for more than 48 hours. All blood cultures are negative. The plan includes adding on differential white count, following fever curve and white count, discontinuing antibiotics, and sending hypercoagulability workup.

4. Azotemia/Fluid Status: The patient has suspected acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with unclear precipitant. There is evidence of possible microangiopathy on the second look at renal biopsy. The plan includes trial of diuretics (lasix/diuril) to diurese, discussing hemodialysis with the renal team, checking smear for schistocytes, and following"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

- The patient has worsening renal function, which was initially suspected to be acute tubular necrosis (ATN) but now appears to be due to microangiopathy on the second look at the renal biopsy. There is also evidence of volume overload, so the patient was given 120mg IV lasix.

- The patient's neurologic examination is consistent with brainstem pathology, possibly toxic/metabolic or uremic in etiology. Serum copper and zinc levels have been sent for analysis.

- The patient requires a PICC line placement for further management.

- The patient has been on invasive ventilation since August 10th, 04:43 AM, with a tracheostomy tube in place. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 29 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 83 beats per"

","The patient's medical history and current condition suggest several potential complications. 

1. Renal function: The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by the increased BUN/Cr levels. There is evidence of volume overload, and the patient was given IV lasix. The recommendation is to trial diuresis and consider renal replacement therapy (RRT). Microangiopathy on renal biopsy is also suspected, and a hemolysis workup and smear for schistocytes have been sent.

2. Neurological condition: The patient's neurological examination is consistent with brainstem pathology, possibly due to toxic/metabolic causes or uremia. Serum copper and zinc levels have been sent for analysis.

   1)Neuro- remains unresponsive. Exam concerning for brainstem injury but
   MRI does not show this. ?component of toxic metabolic.
   2)Pulm- back on vent now after desat with turning. Wean FI02 and try to
   put back on trach collar today.

","The patient is currently unresponsive with respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient has been on invasive ventilation and received Lasix for volume overload, as assessed by an ultrasound of the inferior vena cava. Renal function is being considered, with the possibility of hemodialysis (HD) due to uremia and volume overload. 

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfasalazine and unknown allergens, and they have been receiving various medications, including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, Plavix, thiamine, folate, mvi, Atrovent, asa, and albuterol.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/58 to 109/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 6,526 mL and total output of 1,032 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,494 mL. The patient is receiving care in the ICU, including invasive ventilation, and has tracheostomy and nasogastric tubes in place. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with asthma admitted with NSTEMI,
   cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, renal
   failure recently intiated on HD, now with fevers, bandemia and GPCs in
   blood cultulres.
   .
   1.  GPC Bacteremia.  Patient with new fevers, rising WBC, bandemia, and
   GPCs in clusters and pairs.  Likely source is left IJ.  No evidence of
   pneumonia on exam.  All other cultures negative.
   - removed line
   - replace IJ
   - vancomycin per HD protocol
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u culture data, speciation
   .
   2.  Rising CK.  Patient with rapidly rising CK without a clear source
   of rhabdo.  Will evaluate for seizures with repeat EEG.  Not on a
   statin.
   - f/u EEG
   - trend CK
   - f/u aldolase
   .
   3.  Hemoptytis.  Patient with brief episode of hemoptysis today, likely
   secondary to trauma, but will send sputum to evaluate for infection.
   Hct also down, but likely secondary to HD prematurely stopped yesterday
   without replacing blood.     On aspirin/plavix.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   - bronch if she has persistent hemoptysis
   4.  Altered mental status.   Persistently AMS, perhaps slightly
   improved with HD yesterday.  H/o CVA.  Previous EEG showed metabolic
   encephalopathy, but there is concern for non-convulsive status given
   rising ck, so will re-check EEG.  Patient also now with positive blood
   cultures for GPC which may be contributing to AMS.
   - monitor mental status
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u copper, zinc levels
   5.  Respiratory failure.   Patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis
   likely [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay
   with periods of apnea.  Was
   - wean back to trach collar if able
   - follow ABG and respiratory status on trach collar
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   -diurese if able (lasix/diuril)
   6.  Volume status.  Patient was hypotensive yesterday after being
   diuresed 3L yesterday, requiring 500 cc boluses x 3.  Will keep patient
   even today with dialysis.   Patient will need D5W for hypernatremia.
   Patient is grossly volume overloaded.
   - goal Is= Os
   .
   7.  Renal Failure.  Suspected ATN but unclear precipitant. No evidence
   of vasculitis on renal biopsy but question of possible microangiopathy
   on second look at biopsy however platelets normal.
   - continue HD
   - renal tube feeds
   - hold ACEI
   8.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   9.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT rending down.  No clear etiology of renal
   failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, NSTEMI, and cerebral ischemic event. She was admitted with persistent altered mental status, renal failure, and is now presenting with fevers, bandemia, and GPCs in blood cultures. She has a rising WBC count and evidence of infection in her blood. The patient also has rising CK levels without a clear source of rhabdomyolysis. She experienced a brief episode of hemoptysis and has a history of CVA. Her mental status is altered, and there is concern for non-convulsive status given the rising CK levels. She has positive blood cultures for GPC, which may be contributing to her altered mental status. The patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis and has been experiencing periods of apnea. She was hypotensive after being diuresed, requiring 500 cc boluses. She is volume overloaded and has suspected ATN with unclear precipitant. She has a history of NSTEMI with inferolateral hypokinesis and ischemic MR. Her AST/ALT levels are trending down, but no clear etiology of renal failure has been identified. She also has hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and is at risk for malnutrition due to gastric bypass surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has fevers, bandemia, and GPCs in blood cultures, suggesting a bloodstream infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo F with asthma admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral
   ischemic event, altered mental status which remains unresponsive, with
   fevers of unknown origin now resolved, but no clear etiology for her
   continued poor mental status and ischemic event. Workup for
   hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, embolic process all negative so far.
   1. Respiratory failure. With persistent respiratory alkalosis likely
   [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay with
   periods of apnea.  Was put back on vent last PM for desat to 70s (?
   Mucous plug).  Now doing well.
   - wean back to trach collar if able
   - follow ABG and respiratory status on trach collar
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   -diurese if able (lasix/diuril)
   2. Altered mental status.
No improvement in mental status off
   sedation. Etiology of AMS is likely multifactorial
 with demonstrated
   resolving embolic process with component of uremia with high BUN which
   has worsened with attempted diuresis yesterday.  Concerning for brain
   stem injury, but not seen on MRI.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
 question whether her current
   mental status can be explained by her ischemic event or whether has
   brainstem injury.
   - follow neuro exam off sedation
   - attempt to work on fluid status to decrease BUN
renal considering HD
   to improve uremia.
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK
   -f/u copper, zinc levels
   3. Fevers of unknown origin.  Afebrile for >48 hours.  All newest blood
   cultures negative. ID signed off. Leukocytosis increased overnight but
   Afebrile
   - add on diff to white count
   - f/u fever curve, white count. No antibiotics
   - f/u culture data
   - send hypercoagulability workup, f/u on vasculitis workup
   4. Azotemia/fluid status.  Suspected ATN but unclear precipitant. No
   evidence of vasculitis on renal biopsy but question of possible
   microangiopathy on second look at biopsy however platelets normal.
   Patient with increased Cr, BUN yesterday with attempted diuresis with
   IV lasix with minimal response in increased urine output. Patient is
   total body overloaded but unclear whether is intravascularly depleted
   or overloaded. Concern for possible intravascular depletion with cold
   extremities, difficulty in palpating peripheral pulse
   - Trial of lasix/diuril to diurese
   - Talk to renal re: possibility of starting hemodialysis
   - Check smear for schistocytes
   - follow urine output, creatinine
   -continue to hold ACEI
   -avoid nephrotoxins as possible, renally dose meds
   6.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   -f/u hypercoag work up
   7.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT rending down.  GGT elevated at 343, could
   be [**12-29**] chronic liver dz or vasculitis. No signs of obstructive disease
   through hospital stay.
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   - f/u aldolase
   -consider liver biopsy if persists thru weekend
   8.  Hyperglycemia.   Exacerbated by steroids.  Cover with HISS
   glucose well controlled overnight
   9. h/o ETOH use: No evidence of withdrawal. Question of whether
   component of wernickes is possible contributant to mental status.
   - continue thiamine, folate, MVI
   10.Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass so no PEG planned
   currently
   - Continue tube feeds
   11. Hypernatremia:  Replete free water - will switch to IV as unclear
   how much she absorbs given her gastric bypass.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, who was admitted with NSTEMI and cerebral ischemic event. She has been unresponsive with fevers of unknown origin, now resolved. Workup for hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and embolic process have been negative so far.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, altered mental status, fevers of unknown origin, azotemia/fluid status, NSTEMI, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, history of ETOH use, nutrition concerns, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis and requires ongoing respiratory support. There may be central processes contributing to her respiratory failure, and weaning off the ventilator should be carefully monitored.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has not improved even after discontinuing sedation. It is likely multifactorial, with components of uremia, embolic process, and possible brainstem injury. Neurological follow-up is recommended.

3. Fevers of unknown origin: Although the patient is currently afebrile, there was leukocytosis overnight. All newest blood cultures are negative. Further evaluation of fever curve, white count, and culture data is necessary.

4. Azotemia/fluid status: The patient has increased creatinine and BUN, suggesting possible acute tubular nec"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The patient's condition includes fever with a temperature of 101.3 F (38.5 C), hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 86/58 to 75/46 mmHg, and an elevated heart rate of 95 bpm.

The patient underwent dialysis but experienced line clotting, resulting in only 1 kg being removed. Following dialysis, the patient was hypotensive and required two 500 cc boluses, after which they were started on Levophed. 

The patient's vital signs are monitored closely, with a maximum temperature of 38.5 C (101.3 F) recorded on [**2193-8-10**] at 04:00 PM. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a set volume of 400 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an RSBI of 49.

The patient's physical examination findings are incomplete due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, and others. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, and magnesium are within normal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis secondary to a central line infection. The patient's blood cultures through right internal jugular (RIJ) were positive for gram-positive cocci (GPCs), leading to the initiation of vancomycin treatment. The right RIJ was subsequently removed, and a left subclavian line was placed. The patient underwent dialysis yesterday to maintain fluid balance.

Overnight, the patient's condition remained stable with controlled vital signs, including a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 101/64 to 112/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm remained in sinus rhythm. The patient's weight decreased from 92 kg on admission to 84.3 kg currently.

Fluid balance showed an intake of 1,432 mL, including 616 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 266 mL through tube feeding (TF), and 1,362 mL through intravenous fluids (IVF). The total output consisted of 1,270 mL of urine, 135 mL of blood products, and 281 mL of drain output. The fluid balance was positive at 162 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with asthma admitted with NSTEMI,
   cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, renal
   failure recently intiated on HD, now with fevers, bandemia and GPCs in
   blood cultulres.
   .
   1.  GPC Bacteremia.  Patient with new fevers, rising WBC, bandemia, and
   GPCs in clusters and pairs.  Likely source is left IJ.  No evidence of
   pneumonia on exam.  All other cultures negative.
   - removed line
   - replace IJ
   - vancomycin per HD protocol
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u culture data, speciation
   .
   2.  Rising CK.  Patient with rapidly rising CK without a clear source
   of rhabdo.  Will evaluate for seizures with repeat EEG.  Not on a
   statin.
   - f/u EEG
   - trend CK
   - f/u aldolase
   .
   3.  Hemoptytis.  Patient with brief episode of hemoptysis today, likely
   secondary to trauma, but will send sputum to evaluate for infection.
   Hct also down, but likely secondary to HD prematurely stopped yesterday
   without replacing blood.     On aspirin/plavix.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   - bronch if she has persistent hemoptysis
   4.  Altered mental status.   Persistently AMS, perhaps slightly
   improved with HD yesterday.  H/o CVA.  Previous EEG showed metabolic
   encephalopathy, but there is concern for non-convulsive status given
   rising ck, so will re-check EEG.  Patient also now with positive blood
   cultures for GPC which may be contributing to AMS.
   - monitor mental status
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u copper, zinc levels
   5.  Respiratory failure.   Patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis
   likely [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay
   with periods of apnea.  Was
   - wean back to trach collar if able
   - follow ABG and respiratory status on trach collar
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   -diurese if able (lasix/diuril)
   6.  Volume status.  Patient was hypotensive yesterday after being
   diuresed 3L yesterday, requiring 500 cc boluses x 3.  Will keep patient
   even today with dialysis.   Patient will need D5W for hypernatremia.
   Patient is grossly volume overloaded.
   - goal Is= Os
   .
   7.  Renal Failure.  Suspected ATN but unclear precipitant. No evidence
   of vasculitis on renal biopsy but question of possible microangiopathy
   on second look at biopsy however platelets normal.
   - continue HD
   - renal tube feeds
   - hold ACEI
   8.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   9.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT rending down.  No clear etiology of renal
   failure.
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   -consider liver biopsy if persists
   10.  Hyperglycemia.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - follow fingersticks
   11.Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass so no PEG planned
   currently
   - Continue tube feeds
   11. Hypernatremia:  Replete free water - will switch to IV as unclear
   how much she absorbs given her gastric bypass.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - D5W and free water boluses

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with asthma, admitted with NSTEMI and cerebral ischemic event. She has persistent altered mental status, renal failure, and is now experiencing fevers, bandemia, and GPCs in blood cultures.
- The likely source of infection is the left internal jugular (IJ) line. The patient has been given vancomycin per HD protocol and the line has been removed.
- The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are rising rapidly without a clear source of rhabdomyolysis. An EEG has been ordered to evaluate for seizures.
- The patient had a brief episode of hemoptysis today, which is likely secondary to trauma. Sputum culture has been sent to evaluate for infection.
- The patient's altered mental status has persisted, perhaps slightly improved with dialysis yesterday. A previous EEG showed metabolic encephalopathy, and there is concern for non-convulsive status given the rising CK. Another EEG has been ordered.
- The patient has respiratory failure with persistent respiratory alkalosis likely due to a central process. Her respiratory rate has been in the 20-40s range throughout her MICU stay.
- The patient was hypotensive yesterday after being diuresed 3L, requiring 500 cc boluses x 3. She will be kept even today with dialysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered
   mental status, renal failure recently initiated on HD, now being
   treated for GPC bacteremia.
   .
   1.  GPC Bacteremia.  Likely [**12-29**] line infection. WBC decreased from 29
   to 20. Afebrile overnight. BCX with GPCs, [**Last Name (un) 46**]/specs still pending. No
   evidence of PNA on exam or by CXR.
   - continue vancomycin per HD protocol
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u culture data, speciation
   - daily surveillance cultures until clear
   .
   2.  Rising CK.  Patient with rapidly rising CK, which is still
   increasing. Ddx includes rhabdo (but unclear why precipitous rise all
   of sudden), propofol infusion syndrome (although propofol off for more
   than 4 days now), seizure with repeat EEG pending vs myositis or other
   source for acute muscle injury.
   - have rheumatology see patient today, appreciate recs
   - f/u EEG
   - trend CK
   - f/u aldolase
   .
   3.  Altered mental status.   Persistently AMS, perhaps slightly
   improved with HD yesterday.  H/o CVA.  Previous EEG showed metabolic
   encephalopathy, but there is concern for non-convulsive status given
   rising ck, so will re-check EEG.  Patient also now with positive blood
   cultures for GPC which may be contributing to AMS.
   - monitor mental status
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u copper, zinc levels
   4.  Respiratory failure.   Patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis
   likely [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay
   with periods of apnea.  Was placed back on vent, but respiratory has
   been stable previously on trach collar
   - wean back to trach collar if able
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   5.  Hypotension after HD: Patient had relative hypotension after HD
   over weekend requiring brief course of Levophed. BP has been stable
   since, but will watch carefully during and after HD today.
   - monitor
   .
   6.  Renal Failure.  Suspected ATN but unclear precipitant. No evidence
   of vasculitis on renal biopsy but question of possible microangiopathy
   on second look at biopsy however platelets normal. No schistocytes on
   blood smear. Cr increased overnight from 1.2 to 1.6
   - plan for session of HD today
   - renal tube feeds
   - hold ACEI
   7.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   8.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT still elevated
 GGT elevated indicating
   some liver dysfunction. Aldolase pending
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   -consider liver biopsy if persists
   10.  Hyperglycemia.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - follow fingersticks
   11.Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass so no PEG planned
   currently
   - Continue tube feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and multiple medical conditions including NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, and renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for GPC bacteremia, which is likely due to a central line infection. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased from 29 to 20 overnight. She is also experiencing a rapidly rising creatine kinase (CK) level, which could indicate rhabdomyolysis, propofol infusion syndrome, seizure, myositis, or other sources of acute muscle injury. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is pending to evaluate for non-convulsive status. The patient's altered mental status has shown slight improvement with hemodialysis (HD) yesterday. Her respiratory status remains stable on the ventilator, and she is being weaned off levophed. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with an increase in creatinine from 1.2 to 1.6 overnight. She will undergo another session of HD today. The patient's NSTEMI is being managed with aspirin and Plavix, and her other medications include albuterol, tylenol, heparin, MVI, folate, thiamine, Plavix, chlorhexidine, insulin sliding scale, lansoprazole, and atro"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44-year-old female patient with multiple medical conditions including asthma, gastric bypass surgery, NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, high BUN and renal failure, coag-negative staph in blood cultures, and increasing CK levels. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has been diagnosed with several potential medical complications.

1. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has a bacteremia caused by coag-negative staph, likely originating from a central line infection. Vancomycin has been prescribed for HD protocol, and surveillance cultures are being monitored.

2. Rising CK: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are rapidly increasing, which may indicate rhabdomyolysis, propofol infusion syndrome, seizure, or myositis. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause.

3. Decreased level of consciousness: The patient's level of consciousness remains persistently decreased, but there have been some signs of regaining brainstem function with hemodialysis. Neurological evaluation and EEG monitoring are ongoing.

4. Renal Failure with disproportionately increased BUN: The patient has renal failure with increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels despite undergoing hemodialysis. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are also present.

5. Thrombocytopenia/anemia: The patient's platelet count is low,"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, high BUN and renal failure recently initiated on HD, coag-negative staph in blood cultures, and persistently increasing CK levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has a bacteremia caused by coag-negative staph, likely due to a line infection. Vancomycin is being administered per HD protocol, and the patient's fever curve and WBC count should be monitored.
2. Rising CK: The patient's CK levels are increasing rapidly, which could be due to rhabdomyolysis, propofol infusion syndrome, seizure, myositis, or other sources of acute muscle injury. An EEG is pending to evaluate for seizure activity.
3. Decreased level of consciousness: The patient's level of consciousness is persistently decreased, but there may be episodes of tracking and nystagmus on caloric testing, indicating some regaining of brainstem function with hemodialysis.
4. Renal failure with disproportionately increased BUN: The patient has renal failure, and the BUN is decreasing but creatinine is increasing. The patient's HD line placement is under investigation, and a tunneled line placement is requested.
5. Thrombocytopenia/anemia: The patient has throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered
   mental status, renal failure recently initiated on HD, now being
   treated for GPC bacteremia.
   .
   1.  GPC Bacteremia.  Likely [**12-29**] line infection. WBC decreased from 29
   to 20. Afebrile overnight. BCX with GPCs, [**Last Name (un) 46**]/specs still pending. No
   evidence of PNA on exam or by CXR.
   - continue vancomycin per HD protocol
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u culture data, speciation
   - daily surveillance cultures until clear
   .
   2.  Rising CK.  Patient with rapidly rising CK, which is still
   increasing. Ddx includes rhabdo (but unclear why precipitous rise all
   of sudden), propofol infusion syndrome (although propofol off for more
   than 4 days now), seizure with repeat EEG pending vs myositis or other
   source for acute muscle injury.
   - have rheumatology see patient today, appreciate recs
   - f/u EEG
   - trend CK
   - f/u aldolase
   .
   3.  Altered mental status.   Persistently AMS, perhaps slightly
   improved with HD yesterday.  H/o CVA.  Previous EEG showed metabolic
   encephalopathy, but there is concern for non-convulsive status given
   rising ck, so will re-check EEG.  Patient also now with positive blood
   cultures for GPC which may be contributing to AMS.
   - monitor mental status
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u copper, zinc levels
   4.  Respiratory failure.   Patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis
   likely [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay
   with periods of apnea.  Was placed back on vent, but respiratory has
   been stable previously on trach collar
   - wean back to trach collar if able
   - follow daily CXR
   - continue nebs prn
   5.  Hypotension after HD: Patient had relative hypotension after HD
   over weekend requiring brief course of Levophed. BP has been stable
   since, but will watch carefully during and after HD today.
   - monitor
   .
   6.  Renal Failure.  Suspected ATN but unclear precipitant. No evidence
   of vasculitis on renal biopsy but question of possible microangiopathy
   on second look at biopsy however platelets normal. No schistocytes on
   blood smear. Cr increased overnight from 1.2 to 1.6
   - plan for session of HD today
   - renal tube feeds
   - hold ACEI
   7.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   8.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT still elevated
 GGT elevated indicating
   some liver dysfunction. Aldolase pending
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   -consider liver biopsy if persists
   10.  Hyperglycemia.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - follow fingersticks
   11.Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass so no PEG planned
   currently
   - Continue tube feeds
   12. Hypernatremia:  Resolved
   - D5W and free water boluses prn
   13. Hemoptysis
 no episodes overnight. Hct stable

   decreased BUN but increased Cr overnight. Patient with HD line in, but
   placed under unknown circumstances.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - IR-guided tunneled line placement requested. As soon as this new line
   placed, will need to pull current HD line.
   - follow BUN/Cr.
   5. Thrombocytopenia/anemia: Patient with baseline anemia which has not
   been changing. However, thrombocytopenia new over last 3 days. With
   some evidence of microangiopathic process on renal biopsy and now
   fulfills criteria for TTP with low platelets. Also with unknown
   significance of high percentage of nucleated red cells on diff, with
   high retic count
 which may indicate response to anemia

   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo or
   muscle process other than myocardial.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, high BUN and renal failure, coag-negative staph in blood cultures, and increasing CK levels. She has several ongoing medical complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GPC Bacteremia: Ms. [Known Lastname] has a bacteremia caused by coag-negative staph, likely due to a line infection. Vancomycin has been initiated and will be continued per HD protocol. Monitoring of fever curve and WBC is necessary, along with follow-up culture data and surveillance cultures.

2. Rising CK: The patient's CK levels are rapidly increasing, which could be due to rhabdo, propofol infusion syndrome, seizure, myositis, or other muscle injuries. An EEG is pending to rule out seizure activity, and the patient will be followed by rheumatology. Trends in CK levels should be monitored, and further evaluation for the cause of the elevated CK is required.

3. Decreased Level of Consciousness: Despite hemodialysis, the patient's level of consciousness remains decreased. Episodes of tracking and nystagmus on caloric testing indicate some regaining of brainstem function. Neurological follow-up is recommended, along with continued monitoring of BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, and WBC.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with an unclear chief complaint. The patient underwent dialysis catheter placement on 2193-08-13 at 06:08 PM and it was stopped on 2193-08-14 at 12:22 AM. The physician's impression is that the patient's hemogram is not consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome, but rather suggests sepsis. The physician also recommends checking hemoglobin electrophoresis to rule out sickle trait and ruling out heparin-induced thrombocytopenia by sending platelet factor 4 antibodies. The physician is concerned about an underlying vasculitis, especially considering toe findings concerning for thromboembolic or vasculitic process. Renal, dermatology, and neurology assessments were provided, along with recommendations for further workup. Allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and other medications were documented. The patient's medical and family history remained unchanged from admission. Review of systems is unchanged except as noted below.

- Other lab results are provided below.

Assessment and plan:
- ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and comments were documented.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hemogram suggests sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Vasculitis: The physician is concerned about an underlying vasculitis, which can cause damage to blood vessels and result in organ damage or failure.
3. Thromboembolic events: The toe findings concerning for thromboembolic or vasculitic process may indicate a risk of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Although the physician feels HIT is unlikely, ruling out HIT by sending platelet factor 4 antibodies is recommended due to the possibility of developing thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications.
5. Renal failure: The elevated creatinine level suggests impaired renal function, which can progress to renal failure if not properly managed.
6. Infection: Sepsis and the presence of a dialysis catheter increase the risk of infection, including catheter-related bloodstream infections.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored"

   1.  GPC Bacteremia.  Likely [**12-29**] line infection. BCx from 1 bottle on
   [**8-10**] growing out coag negative staph. Has remained afebrile and WBC
   decreasing. LIJ line tip still pending. HD catheter placed 1 hour prior
   to first fever spike.
   - continue vancomycin per HD protocol (day #3 today)
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u culture data, speciation
   - f/u surveillance cultures
   .
   2.  Rising CK.  Patient with rapidly rising CK, which is still
   increasing. Ddx includes rhabdo (but unclear why precipitous rise all
   of sudden), propofol infusion syndrome (although propofol off for more
   than 4 days now), seizure with repeat EEG pending vs myositis or other
   source for acute muscle injury. Aldolase positive indicating muscle
   injury. Patient seen by rheumatology yesterday, appreciate recs. Sent

   - rheumatology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u EEG
   - trend CK, see if we can stratify CK (BB/MM/MB)
   .
   3.  Decreased level of consciousness.   Persistently decreased level of
   conciousness but may have episodes of tracking, and nystagmus on
   caloric testing which may indicate some regaining of brainstem function
   with hemodialysis.
   - neurology following, appreciate recs
   - follow neuro exam
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u copper, zinc levels
   - avoid propofol
   4.Renal Failure with disproportionately increased BUN: On HD, with
   decreased BUN but increased Cr overnight. Patient with HD line in, but
   placed under unknown circumstances.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - IR-guided tunneled line placement requested. As soon as this new line
   placed, will need to pull current HD line.
   - follow BUN/Cr.
   5. Thrombocytopenia/anemia: Patient with baseline anemia which has not
   been changing. However, thrombocytopenia new over last 3 days. With
   some evidence of microangiopathic process on renal biopsy and now
   fulfills criteria for TTP with low platelets. Also with unknown
   significance of high percentage of nucleated red cells on diff, with
   high retic count
 which may indicate response to anemia
   - resend hemolysis labs
   - consult hematology today
   - continue to trend
   6.  Respiratory failure.   Patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis
   likely [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay
   with periods of apnea.  Has been tolerating trach collar
   - continue trach collar
   - continue nebs prn
   7.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo or
   muscle process other than myocardial.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   8.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT still elevated
 GGT elevated indicating
   some liver dysfunction.
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   -consider liver biopsy if persists
   10.  Hyperglycemia.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - follow fingersticks

   admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered
   mental status, high BUN and renal failure recently initiated on HD,
   coag negative staph in blood cultures, and persistently increasing CK
   levels.
   .
   Decreased level of consciousness.   Persistently decreased level of
   conciousness but may have episodes of tracking, and nystagmus on
   caloric testing which may indicate some regaining of brainstem function
   with hemodialysis.
   - neurology following, appreciate recs
   - follow neuro exam
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u copper, zinc levels
   - avoid propofol
   Hypotension: With possible hypoperfusion to her end organs including
   head, kidneys, muscles, liver. Patient may have poor cardiac output, as
   she has peripheral edema with normal edema. Patient now on levophed
   with SBP 100s.
   - trial increasing pressor support to goal SBP 120 to increase
   perfusion
   - repeat TTE today to assess cardiac function and RV function
   - repeat lactate
   Renal Failure with disproportionately increased BUN: On HD, with
   decreased BUN but increased Cr overnight. New IR-placed tunneled line
   placed yesterday. Fena consistent with decreased renal flow
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - HD planned for today
   GPC Bacteremia.  Likely [**12-29**] line infection
 both the prior HD catheter
   and LIJ line pulled. BCx from 1 bottle on [**8-10**] growing out coag
   negative staph. Sensitivities and specificities pending. Has remained
   afebrile and WBC decreasing.  HD catheter placed 1 hour prior to first
   fever spike.
   - continue vancomycin per HD protocol (day #4 today)
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u culture data, speciation
   - f/u surveillance cultures
   Rising CK.  Patient with rapidly rising CK, which is still increasing.
   Ddx includes rhabdo (but unclear why precipitous rise all of sudden),
   propofol infusion syndrome (although propofol off for more than 4 days
   now), seizure with repeat EEG pending vs myositis or other source for
   acute muscle injury. Aldolase positive indicating muscle injury.
   Patient seen by rheumatology yesterday, appreciate recs. Sent [**Doctor First Name **]-1 and
   MI-2 autoantibody
   - rheumatology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u EEG
   - trend CK, see if we can stratify CK (BB/MM/MB)
   Thrombocytopenia/anemia: Patient with baseline anemia which has not
   been changing. However, thrombocytopenia new over last 3 days. With
   some evidence of microangiopathic process on renal biopsy and now
   fulfills criteria for TTP with low platelets. Also with unknown
   significance of high percentage of nucleated red cells on diff, with
   high retic count
 which may indicate response to anemia. Derm biopsy
   of toe pending. No indication of overwhelming hemolysis process.
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - f/u derm biopsy results
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   Respiratory failure.   Patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis
   likely [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay
   with periods of apnea.  Has been tolerating trach collar
   - continue trach collar
   - continue nebs prn

   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo or
   muscle process other than myocardial.
   - TTE to reevaluate today
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44-year-old female with asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, high BUN and renal failure on HD, coag-negative staph in blood cultures, and persistently increasing CK levels. She is currently experiencing hypotension with SBPs in the 80s, and low-dose levophed has been started. 

Medical Complications:
1. Decreased level of consciousness: Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] has persistently decreased levels of consciousness but may have episodes of tracking and nystagmus on caloric testing, indicating some regaining of brainstem function with hemodialysis. Neurology is following up with the patient.
2. Hypotension: The patient has poor cardiac output, as evidenced by peripheral edema and normal edema. She is currently on levophed with SBP 100s. The goal is to increase the pressor support to SBP 120 to enhance perfusion. A repeat TTE today is recommended to assess cardiac function and RV function, and repeat lactate should be done.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure with disproportionately increased BUN. On HD, with decreased BUN but increased Cr overnight. New IR-placed tunneled line was placed yesterday. Fena consistent with decreased renal flow. Renal follow-up is recommended"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered
   mental status, high BUN and renal failure recently initiated on HD,
   coag negative staph in blood cultures, and persistently increasing CK
   levels.
   .
   1.  GPC Bacteremia.  Likely [**12-29**] line infection. BCx from 1 bottle on
   [**8-10**] growing out coag negative staph. Has remained afebrile and WBC
   decreasing. LIJ line tip still pending. HD catheter placed 1 hour prior
   to first fever spike.
   - continue vancomycin per HD protocol (day #3 today)
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u culture data, speciation
   - f/u surveillance cultures
   .
   2.  Rising CK.  Patient with rapidly rising CK, which is still
   increasing. Ddx includes rhabdo (but unclear why precipitous rise all
   of sudden), propofol infusion syndrome (although propofol off for more
   than 4 days now), seizure with repeat EEG pending vs myositis or other
   source for acute muscle injury. Aldolase positive indicating muscle
   injury. Patient seen by rheumatology yesterday, appreciate recs. Sent
   [**Doctor First Name **]-1 and MI-2 autoantibody
   - rheumatology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u EEG
   - trend CK, see if we can stratify CK (BB/MM/MB)
   .
   3.  Decreased level of consciousness.   Persistently decreased level of
   conciousness but may have episodes of tracking, and nystagmus on
   caloric testing which may indicate some regaining of brainstem function
   with hemodialysis.
   - neurology following, appreciate recs
   - follow neuro exam
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u copper, zinc levels
   - avoid propofol
   4.Renal Failure with disproportionately increased BUN: On HD, with
   decreased BUN but increased Cr overnight. Patient with HD line in, but
   placed under unknown circumstances.
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - IR-guided tunneled line placement requested. As soon as this new line
   placed, will need to pull current HD line.
   - follow BUN/Cr.
   5. Thrombocytopenia/anemia: Patient with baseline anemia which has not
   been changing. However, thrombocytopenia new over last 3 days. With
   some evidence of microangiopathic process on renal biopsy and now
   fulfills criteria for TTP with low platelets. Also with unknown
   significance of high percentage of nucleated red cells on diff, with
   high retic count
 which may indicate response to anemia
   - resend hemolysis labs
   - consult hematology today
   - continue to trend
   6.  Respiratory failure.   Patient has persistent respiratory alkalosis
   likely [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout MICU stay
   with periods of apnea.  Has been tolerating trach collar
   - continue trach collar
   - continue nebs prn
   7.  NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo or
   muscle process other than myocardial.
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   -continue BB, hold ACE-I given ARF
   8.  Transaminitis.   AST/ALT still elevated
 GGT elevated indicating
   some liver dysfunction.
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   -consider liver biopsy if persists
   10.  Hyperglycemia.
   - insulin sliding scale
   - follow fingersticks
   11.Nutrition.  Patient is s/p gastric bypass so no PEG planned
   currently
   - Continue tube feeds but held this AM pending possible tunneled line
   placement
   12. Hypernatremia:  Resolved
   - D5W and free water boluses prn
   13. Hemoptysis
 no episodes overnight. Hct stable

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfasalazine and unknown allergies. The patient received vancomycin on 2193-08-12 at 10:00 PM.

The patient underwent dialysis catheter placement on 2193-08-13 at 06:08 PM and it was stopped on 2193-08-14 at 12:22 AM. The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 0.06 mcg/kg/min. Other medications include dextrose 50% given on 2193-08-13 at 08:08 PM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 107 bpm with a normal range of 81-107 bpm, blood pressure of 94/54 mmHg with a normal range of 76/48-108/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute with a normal range of 18-42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 65%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's weight is currently 84.3 kg and the admission weight was 92 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,490 mL"

   24 Hour Events:
   Derm pathology results consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy.
   Rheuamtology feels patient has no evidence of vasculitis.  They are
   recommending considering systemic anticoagulation and also repeat MRI.
   Renal feels she has TTP and needs ADAMTS tested and should get
   plasmapharesis.  They recommended renal ultrasound to evaluate for
   arterial or venous thrombus, which was non-diagnostic due to limited
   study.
   Heme/onc feeels she has early DIC and recommended checking serial DIC
   labs.  Another possibility is an embolic source, so recommending repeat
   TEE.
   Neurology feels that is is okay to get systemic anticoagulation and do
   not feel she needs further imaging.
   Patient was tachypneic overnight around 10pm with increased bloody
   pulmonary secretions.  Patient was tachypneic to 40s.  PTT initially
   elevated after dialsysi (with heparin) but then trended down and
   pulmonary bleeding resolved.  Patient placed on vent due to concern for
   tiring.  Patient seemed aware and anxious during this episode, so 1 mg
   of ativan given.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's condition remains critical in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy, and there is a possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's renal function is impaired, and they have been receiving dialysis. The patient has also experienced episodes of pulmonary bleeding and required invasive ventilation. There is an ongoing debate among the medical team regarding the diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The patient's neurological status is not well-assessed due to sedation and the use of a ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): This is a condition characterized by blood clots forming in small blood vessels throughout the body. It can lead to organ damage and failure if not treated promptly.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): This is a serious condition that involves abnormal blood clotting throughout the body's small blood vessels. It can result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death if not managed effectively.
3. Pulmonary bleeding: The patient's recent episode of bloody pulmonary secretions and tachypnea indicate potential pulmonary bleeding. This can lead to hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest impaired renal"

   admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered
   mental status, high BUN and renal failure recently initiated on HD,
   coag negative staph in blood cultures, and persistently increasing CK
   levels.
   .
   Decreased level of consciousness.   Persistently decreased level of
   conciousness but may have episodes of tracking, and nystagmus on
   caloric testing which may indicate some regaining of brainstem function
   with hemodialysis.
   - neurology following, appreciate recs
   - follow neuro exam
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u copper, zinc levels
   - avoid propofol
   Hypotension: With possible hypoperfusion to her end organs including
   head, kidneys, muscles, liver. Patient may have poor cardiac output, as
   she has peripheral edema with normal edema. Patient now on levophed
   with SBP 100s.
   - trial increasing pressor support to goal SBP 120 to increase
   perfusion
   - repeat TTE today to assess cardiac function and RV function
   - repeat lactate
   Renal Failure with disproportionately increased BUN: On HD, with
   decreased BUN but increased Cr overnight. New IR-placed tunneled line
   placed yesterday. Fena consistent with decreased renal flow
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - HD planned for today
   GPC Bacteremia.  Likely [**12-29**] line infection
 both the prior HD catheter
   and LIJ line pulled. BCx from 1 bottle on [**8-10**] growing out coag
   negative staph. Sensitivities and specificities pending. Has remained
   afebrile and WBC decreasing.  HD catheter placed 1 hour prior to first
   fever spike.
   - continue vancomycin per HD protocol (day #4 today)
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u culture data, speciation
   - f/u surveillance cultures
   Rising CK.  Patient with rapidly rising CK, which is still increasing.
   Ddx includes rhabdo (but unclear why precipitous rise all of sudden),
   propofol infusion syndrome (although propofol off for more than 4 days
   now), seizure with repeat EEG pending vs myositis or other source for
   acute muscle injury. Aldolase positive indicating muscle injury.
   Patient seen by rheumatology yesterday, appreciate recs. Sent [**Doctor First Name **]-1 and
   MI-2 autoantibody
   - rheumatology following, appreciate recs
   - f/u EEG
   - trend CK, see if we can stratify CK (BB/MM/MB)
   Thrombocytopenia/anemia: Patient with baseline anemia which has not
   been changing. However, thrombocytopenia new over last 3 days. With
   some evidence of microangiopathic process on renal biopsy and now
   fulfills criteria for TTP with low platelets. Also with unknown
   significance of high percentage of nucleated red cells on diff, with
   high retic count
 which may indicate response to anemia. Derm biopsy
   of toe pending. No indication of overwhelming hemolysis process.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, high BUN and renal failure recently initiated on HD, coag-negative staph in blood cultures, and persistently increasing CK levels. She is currently in the ICU with multiple complications including hypotension, renal failure, GPC bacteremia, rising CK levels, thrombocytopenia/anemia, respiratory failure, NSTEMI, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, and nutritional concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension with possible hypoperfusion to her end organs including the head, kidneys, muscles, and liver. Poor cardiac output may contribute to this condition.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure with a disproportionately increased BUN despite being on hemodialysis (HD). Decreased renal flow is indicated by a Fena.
3. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci, likely due to a line infection. Sensitivities and specificities of the organism are pending.
4. Rising CK Levels: The patient has rapidly rising CK levels, which could be due to rhabdomyolysis, propofol infusion syndrome, seizure, or myositis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered
   mental status, high BUN and renal failure on HD, new thrombocytopenia
   and concern for DIC or TTP picture.
   .
   Hemoptysis: In context of increased PTT after heparin flushing at HD.
   Hct stable overnight and bloody secretions decreased with decrease of
   PTT overnight
   - bronchoscopy this AM to evaluate for bleed
   - trend Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - avoid aggressive suctioning
   .
   Thrombocytopenia/anemia: Platelets decreasing, and hemolysis workup
   consistent with DIC with low fibrinogen, high D-dimer and FDP. Also
   with some evidence of microangiopathic process on renal biopsy and derm
   biopsy of toe lesions concerning for TTP process
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - talk to transfusion medicine regarding utility of plasmapheresis,
   plasma infusion
   - trend DIC labs and platelets, coags
   - f/u HIT antibody and consider starting anticoagulation if high
   suspicion for coagulopathy
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   Decreased level of consciousness.   No change in mental status
   overnight. Still no purposeful interaction. Persistently decreased
   level of conciousness but may have episodes of tracking, and nystagmus
   on caloric testing which may indicate some regaining of brainstem
   function with hemodialysis.
   - neurology following, appreciate recs
   - follow neuro exam
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u copper, zinc levels
   - avoid propofol
   Hypotension: With possible hypoperfusion to her end organs including
   head, kidneys, muscles, liver. Patient may have poor cardiac output, as
   she has peripheral edema with normal edema. Patient now on levophed
   with SBP 100s. Patient slightly warmer extremities on levophed. TTE
   with decreased EF but little change from prior ECHO
   - continue levophed with goal SBP 110-120
   - try to re-place a-line today
   Renal Failure with disproportionately increased BUN: On HD, with
   decreased BUN. Patient now essentially anuric
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - no HD today

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479] is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, high BUN and renal failure on HD, new thrombocytopenia, and concern for DIC or TTP picture. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient has had bloody secretions and a high PTT after heparin flushing, indicating a possible bleeding disorder. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and manage it appropriately.
2. Thrombocytopenia/anemia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, and there is evidence of hemolysis consistent with DIC with low fibrinogen, high D-dimer, and FDP. Additionally, there are indications of microangiopathic process on renal biopsy and derm biopsy of toe lesions concerning for TTP process. Close monitoring of platelet levels, coagulation parameters, and consideration of plasmapheresis and plasma infusion may be necessary.
3. Decreased level of consciousness: The patient's mental status remains altered, with episodes of tracking and nystagmus on caloric testing, indicating some regaining of brainstem function with hemodialysis. Neurological evaluation and further investigations such as an EEG are recommended.
4. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension with possible hypoperfusion to her end organs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has a poor prognosis. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) and developed atrial fibrillation during the procedure. They were put back on mechanical ventilation overnight without improvement in heart rate or comfort level and were switched back to a tachypnea mask this morning.

The patient also developed hypoglycemia, which required a D10 (dextrose 50%) drip overnight. Their fingersticks stabilized on D10 at 75cc/hr. Levophed was weaned down throughout the day but needed to be increased overnight following dialysis up to 0.3mL. The patient received two boluses of 500mL without improvement in blood pressure.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered
   mental status, high BUN and renal failure on HD, new thrombocytopenia
   and concern for DIC or TTP picture.
   Thrombocytopenia/anemia: Platelets decreasing, and hemolysis workup
   consistent with DIC with low fibrinogen, high D-dimer and FDP. Also
   with some evidence of microangiopathic process on renal biopsy and derm
   biopsy of toe lesions concerning for TTP process
   - on heparin gtt (HIT negative)
   -transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - trend DIC labs and platelets, coags
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   Decreased level of consciousness.   No change in mental status
   overnight. Still no purposeful interaction or movement. + spontaneous
   movement of head, . Persistently decreased level of conciousness.
   Unclear precipitant for this decreased level of consciousness, but
   without reversible etiology, prognosis is grim.
   - neurology following, appreciate recs
   - follow neuro exam
   - trend BUN, Cr, CK, fever curve, WBC
   Hypotension: No response to trial of levophed to maintain SBP >110.
   -wean levophed as tolerated, maintain MAP >60.
   Renal Failure with disproportionately increased BUN: On HD, with
   decreased BUN. Patient now essentially anuric
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   - HD today
   GPC Bacteremia.  Likely [**12-29**] line infection
 both the prior HD catheter
   and LIJ line pulled. BCx from 1 bottle on [**8-10**] growing out coag
   negative staph. Sensitivities and specificities pending. Has remained
   afebrile and WBC decreasing.  HD catheter placed 1 hour prior to first
   fever spike.
   - continue vancomycin per HD protocol (day #[**5-4**] today)
   - monitor fever curve and WBC
   - f/u culture data, speciation
   - f/u surveillance cultures
   Rising CK.  Patient with markedly elevated CK; unclear etiology, slight
   improvement today.  Ddx includes rhabdo (but unclear why precipitous
   rise all of sudden), propofol infusion syndrome (although propofol off
   for more than 4 days now) vs myositis vor other source for acute muscle
   injury. Aldolase positive indicating muscle injury.
   - rheumatology following, appreciate recs
   - trend CK, see if we can stratify CK (BB/MM/MB)
   Respiratory failure.   Increased respiratory distress during episode of
   bloody secretions but stable since. Patient has persistent respiratory
   alkalosis likely [**12-29**] central process. Her RR has been 20-40s throughout
   MICU stay with periods of apnea.  Has been tolerating trach collar.
   Unremarkable bronch yesterday.
   - continue trach collar
   - continue nebs prn
   NSTEMI. S/p BMS x2 to 100% occluded distal RCA on admission.  ECHO
   reviewed inferolateral hypokinesis with ischemic     MR.   MI in female
   with history of obesity and no other risk factors at such a young age
   is concerning for hypercoagulable state. Workup on [**8-8**] negative for
   new ischemic event. CK is rising, although could be [**12-29**] rhabdo or
   muscle process other than myocardial. TTE showing decreased EF but no
   change from prior. Plavix may be one inciting factor of TTP, although
   patient needs to finish 30 day course of plavix s/p stent
   -continue aspirin 325 mg daily, plavix 75 mg daily
   Transaminitis.   AST/ALT still elevated
 GGT elevated indicating some
   liver dysfunction.
   -continue to trend LFTs
   -avoid hepatotoxins as able
   Hyperglycemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, cerebral ischemic event, persistent altered mental status, high BUN and renal failure on HD, new thrombocytopenia, and concern for DIC or TTP picture. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including hypotension, renal failure, GPC bacteremia, rising CK levels, respiratory failure, NSTEMI, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, and nutrition issues due to gastric bypass surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is not responding to levophed to maintain SBP >110, indicating uncontrolled hypotension. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is on HD with decreased BUN but remains anuric, suggesting ongoing renal dysfunction. This can result in electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has a suspected line infection with coag-negative staph, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
4. Rising CK Levels: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are markedly elevated, which can indicate rhabdomyolysis, propofol infusion syndrome, or myositis. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory distress and alkalosis,"

   Reviewed [**Hospital **] hospital course so far, and overall poor prognosis.  All
   questions were answered.
   HD performed; 800cc's removed.  Pt developed afib during HD--90-130s.
   She was put back on the vent overnight without improvement in HR or
   comfort level; put back on trach mask this am.
   Transfused 1 unit of cryo.  Heparin gtt d/c
d per heme.
   She developed hypoglycemia requiring a D10 drip overnight.  Her
   fingersticks stabilized on D10 at 75cc/hr.
   Levophed was weaned down throughout the day, but needed to be increased
   overnight following dialysis up to 0.3mL.  She was bolused 500 ml x 2
   without improvement in BP.
   **Overnight, the patient had a window of improved mental status, with
   purposeful tracking of her eyes and answering yes/no questions
   appropriately by nodding or shaking her head.   She is still not moving
   any extremitities.
   On reexamination 1 hour later, she again had no purposeful interaction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and previous admissions for NSTEMI and cerebral ischemic event. She is currently in the ICU with persistent altered mental status, high BUN and renal failure on HD, thrombocytopenia, and concern for DIC or TTP picture. The patient has been on heparin gtt (HIT negative), transfused cryo for fibrinogen <100, heme following, and trend DIC labs and platelets, coags. She also has decreased levels of consciousness with no purposeful interaction or movement. The patient's prognosis is grim without a reversible etiology. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia/anemia: The patient is experiencing a decrease in platelets, and there is evidence of microangiopathic process on renal biopsy and derm biopsy of toe lesions concerning for TTP process. Monitoring platelet levels and coagulation status is important to prevent bleeding complications.
2. Decreased level of consciousness: The patient's persistently decreased level of consciousness without purposeful interaction or movement is concerning. It is unclear what the precipitant for this altered mental status is, and without a reversible etiology, the prognosis is poor. Neurological evaluation and consultation are recommended.
3. Hypotension: The patient has shown no response to trial of levophed to maintain SBP >110, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate blood pressure"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**], a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and previous admission for NSTEMI, is now presenting with multiorgan system failure. She has severe global neurologic depression, multiple embolic CVA, and an unclear etiology of her minimally responsive state. Her prognosis for meaningful recovery is grim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient has severe global neurologic depression, which may indicate brain damage or dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and extent of neurological impairment.

2. Pulmonary Complications: The patient is experiencing hemoptysis (coughing up blood) in the setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Continuous coughing and respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient is currently in shock, with increasing pressor requirements. The cause of shock is uncertain, with possibilities including septic or neurogenic etiology. The patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous NSTEMI, along with the presence of atrial fibrillation, indicate ongoing cardiac issues that require attention.

4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), suggesting potential liver dysfunction. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and tube feeds are currently being administered to support gastrointestinal health.

5. Renal Complications: The patient is experiencing acute"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Neuro: Continues to have no consistent meaningful interaction. Seems
   to be nodding at times, but cannot follow any commands. By vital sign
   parameters, patient is uncomfortable. Has had multiple embolic CVA but
   location of which cannot explain her severe global neurologic
   depression.  Etiology of minimally responsive state is unclear- [**Name2 (NI) 923**]
   metabolic vs brainstem micro infarcts (though no evidence for this by
   MRI).  Prognosis for meaningful recovery is grim.
   -Neuro following
   -Trial of fentanyl boluses for comfort
   #Pulm: Patient increasingly tachypneic overnight, even beyond her prior
   baseline (RR 30-40s at baseline). Has high minute ventilation which may
   be driven by central process. No hemoptysis overnight. Patient placed
   back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either CNS, metabolic or
   increased VD/VT.  Wil try fentanyl first, then bicarb.  If neither
   decrease MV then will get PetCo2 monitor to infer alveolar dead space.
   - check VBG this AM to see if acidemia increased
   - consider bicarb or CVVH if increased acidemia
   - CTA to r/o PE
   - consider end-tidal CO2 monitor if no response
   #Heme: Certainly, patient now in DIC.   Patient s/p 2 units of
   cryoprecipitate with some increase in fibrinogen. Platelets still low
   at 65 today. However, unclear if patient also with underlying
   coagulopathy which is etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in
   kidney, peripheral LE with evidence of LE ischemia.
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - start heparin gtt without bolus with goal PTT 50-60 today. Check
   serial CBCs and stop heparin if Hct falls
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   #CV: Currently in distributive shock, with increasing pressor
   requirement despite fluids. Shock likely septic vs neurogenic in
   etiology.  Increased lactate to 6.0 worrisome for ischemic bowel or
   abcess. Has CAD s/p NSTEMI with BMS to RCA; has 3+MR, globally
   depressed systolic function by echo. However, no marked change from
   prior echo so not likely cardiogenic shock. Still in afib.  Started on
   stress dose steroids yesterday.
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be [**12-29**] pressors
   - pan CT scan with contrast to r/o bowel ischemia, occult abcess
   - Continue steroids 50 mg q6H for BP support/shock
   - Continue asa/plavix for CAD
   #Renal: ARF, anuric, HD dependent.
   -talk to renal regarding initiation of CVVH today
   #Endo: Continues to be hypoglycemia overnight requiring D10 drip to
   maintain normoglycemia (continues on tubefeeds). Unclear etiology---ddx
   includes adrenal failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of
   gluconeogenesis (not supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.
   Poor prognostic sign.
   -continue steroids for presumed adrenal insufficiency (day #2 today)
   -continue D10 gtt, with goal glucose of  100-200.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted for NSTEMI and now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia. The patient has had multiple embolic cerebral vascular accidents, resulting in severe global neurological depression. The etiology of her minimally responsive state is unclear, with possibilities including metabolic factors or brainstem microinfarcts. The prognosis for meaningful recovery is grim.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological Complications: The patient's global neurological depression may indicate potential long-term or permanent neurological damage. This could lead to ongoing cognitive impairment, physical disability, and a decreased quality of life.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient is increasingly tachypneic, indicating potential respiratory distress or failure. This may require mechanical ventilation support and further investigation into the underlying cause, such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.
3. Hematological Complications: The patient has DIC, which is characterized by abnormal blood clotting and bleeding. This condition requires careful management to prevent excessive bleeding or clotting events.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has distributive shock, possibly due to sepsis or neurogenic factors. This can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs and may result in organ failure.
5. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), requiring hemodialysis support. The underlying"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Neuro: Continues to have no consistent meaningful interaction. Seems
   to be nodding at times, but cannot follow any commands. By vital sign
   parameters, patient is uncomfortable. Has had multiple embolic CVA but
   location of which cannot explain her severe global neurologic
   depression.  Etiology of minimally responsive state is unclear- [**Name2 (NI) 923**]
   metabolic vs brainstem micro infarcts (though no evidence for this by
   MRI).  Prognosis for meaningful recovery is grim.
   -Neuro following
   -Trial of fentanyl boluses for comfort
   #Pulm: Patient increasingly tachypneic overnight, even beyond her prior
   baseline (RR 30-40s at baseline). Has high minute ventilation which may
   be driven by central process. No hemoptysis overnight. Patient placed
   back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either CNS, metabolic or
   increased VD/VT.  Wil try fentanyl first, then bicarb.  If neither
   decrease MV then will get PetCo2 monitor to infer alveolar dead space.
   - check VBG this AM to see if acidemia increased
   - consider bicarb or CVVH if increased acidemia
   - CTA to r/o PE
   - consider end-tidal CO2 monitor if no response
   #Heme: Certainly, patient now in DIC.   Patient s/p 2 units of
   cryoprecipitate with some increase in fibrinogen. Platelets still low
   at 65 today. However, unclear if patient also with underlying
   coagulopathy which is etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in
   kidney, peripheral LE with evidence of LE ischemia.
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - start heparin gtt without bolus with goal PTT 50-60 today. Check
   serial CBCs and stop heparin if Hct falls
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   #CV: Currently in distributive shock, with increasing pressor
   requirement despite fluids. Shock likely septic vs neurogenic in
   etiology.  Increased lactate to 6.0 worrisome for ischemic bowel or
   abcess. Has CAD s/p NSTEMI with BMS to RCA; has 3+MR, globally
   depressed systolic function by echo. However, no marked change from
   prior echo so not likely cardiogenic shock. Still in afib.  Started on
   stress dose steroids yesterday.
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be [**12-29**] pressors
   - pan CT scan with contrast to r/o bowel ischemia, occult abcess
   - Continue steroids 50 mg q6H for BP support/shock
   - Continue asa/plavix for CAD
   #Renal: ARF, anuric, HD dependent.
   -talk to renal regarding initiation of CVVH today
   #Endo: Continues to be hypoglycemia overnight requiring D10 drip to
   maintain normoglycemia (continues on tubefeeds). Unclear etiology---ddx
   includes adrenal failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of
   gluconeogenesis (not supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.
   Poor prognostic sign.
   -continue steroids for presumed adrenal insufficiency (day #2 today)
   -continue D10 gtt, with goal glucose of  100-200.
   #ID: s/p 7 days of Vanco for line infection. No fever or increased
   leukocytosis off antibiotics. However, concerning that lactate
   - monitor fever, white count
   #GI: PPI, tube feeds.  LFT

 relatively stable.
   #Musculoskeletal: Rhabdo; CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of
   any extremity.  Hold off on ext MRI for now.
   -trend CK.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, and now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. The patient's neurological condition is described as minimally responsive with severe global depression, and the etiology of this state is unclear. Prognosis for meaningful recovery is grim.

The patient's pulmonary condition has worsened overnight, with increased tachypnea and high minute ventilation. She has been placed back on mechanical ventilation. The plan includes trying fentanyl first, then bicarbonate, and if neither decreases MV, obtaining a PetCo2 monitor to infer alveolar dead space.

The patient is also experiencing hematological complications, including DIC, with low platelets and fibrinogen levels. The plan involves starting heparin without a bolus, with the goal of PTT 50-60 today, checking serial CBCs, and stopping heparin if Hct falls. Cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusions will be given as needed.

Cardiovascularly, the patient is in distributive shock, with increasing pressor requirements despite fluids. The lactate level is elevated, which may indicate ischemic bowel or abscess. An increased dose of steroids has been started for shock and BP support.

Renally, the patient is experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), requiring hem"

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing multiorgan failure. The patient's condition has been improving, as indicated by improved fluid status and reduced need for free water flushes. However, the patient developed hyponatremia, which required adjustment in free water flushes. The patient also received a transfusion of cryoprecipitate due to low fibrinogen levels. The course of vancomycin has been completed, and the Levophed rate was increased overnight due to hypotension. The patient's CK and WBC trends are showing improvement.

The patient has allergies to sulfasalazine and an unknown allergen. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin at 08:00 PM on [**2193-8-16**]. The patient is currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine at a rate of 0.18 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, starting from [**2193-8-18**] 06:06 AM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: maximum temperature (Tmax) of 37 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 107/79 mmHg to 113/87 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm. The patient's weight has decreased from 92 kg at admission to 78.1 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,187 mL and a total output of 155 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,032 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume (Vt) of 624 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 71. The patient's partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is not available, but the oxygen exchange ventilation (Ve) is 25.7 L/min.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 25.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 7.3 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 104 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 156 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 156 mg/dL, and potassium level of 16 mEq/L.

   normoglycemia (continues on tubefeeds). Unclear etiology---ddx includes
   adrenal failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of
   gluconeogenesis (not supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.
   Poor prognostic sign.
   -start steroids for presumed adrenal insufficiency.
   -continue D10 gtt, with goal glucose of  100-200.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and admitted with NSTEMI. She is now experiencing multiorgan system failure. The patient's neurologic status is severely depressed with multiple embolic CVA. The etiology of her minimally responsive state is unclear, with possibilities including metabolic issues or brainstem microinfarcts. Her mental status is waxing and waning. The prognosis for meaningful recovery is grim.

The patient has hemoptysis this morning, along with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has ongoing shock, possibly septic or neurogenic in origin, and has been in atrial fibrillation. The patient has coronary artery disease with a previous myocardial infarction and has undergone stenting of the right coronary artery. She also has a 3+ mitral regurgitation and globally depressed systolic function on echocardiogram.

The patient's gastrointestinal system shows elevated liver function tests but is relatively stable. Her renal system is experiencing acute renal failure, anuria, and dependency on hemodialysis. Electrolytes are okay. Her endocrine system is showing new-onset hypoglycemia overnight, requiring D10 drip to maintain normal blood glucose levels. The etiology of the hypoglycemia is unclear, with potential causes including adrenal failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of gluconeogenesis, or overwhelming shock.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiorgan failure secondary to diffuse microangiopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) of unknown etiology. The patient has multiple complications including cerebrovascular accident (CVA), right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), respiratory failure post tracheostomy, acute renal failure (ARF), limb ischemia, and septic shock.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart rate: 106 bpm (normal range: 90-111 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 105/70 mmHg (with fluctuations)
- Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute (normal range: 17-37 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 91%

The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, liver enzymes, and cardiac enzymes. Imaging reveals a tracheostomy in place with clear lungs.

The patient's condition continues to deteriorate, with progressive limb ischemia and persistent pressor requirement. The patient is on multiple medications including hydrocortisone, norepinephrine, heparin, prevacid, RISS, peridex, plavix, thiamine, folate, mvit, as"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ciritically ill patient with MODS of unclear etiology now progressing
   to digital ischemia in the setting of persistant levophed use and DIC.
   NEURO: Nodding intermittently to questions which is somewhat improved.
   Increased respiratory rate may be secondary pain or metabolic in
   nature.  Will check VBG and will also try fentanyl gtt.
   CV: Persistent pressor requirement in the setting of distributive shock
   and ongoing DIC.  Will continue steroids as seoncdary pressor.  On asa
   and plavix.
   LUNGS: High MV (23) may be either CNS, metabolic or increased VD/VT.
   Wil try fentanyl first, then bicarb.  If neither decrease MV then will
   get PetCo2 monitor to infer alveolar dead space.
   GI: Tube feeds at goal.
   ENDO: Persistent hypoglycemia an ominus sign, but FS maintained on D10
   gtt.  Will continue to check.
   GU: Will ask renal about HD today vs CVVH
   ID: On no abx. CMV serologies pending.  Will pan CT scan to look for
   focal abscess.
   RHEUM: Consult has no further recs. CPKs appear to be trending down.
   HEME: Heme consult appreciated.  Cryo/blood products as needed.  Will
   start
   PPX: peridex, pneumoboots, prevacid
   DISPO: Critically ill, prognosis very grim. Will speak with family
   today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with multiorgan failure secondary to diffuse microangiopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) of unknown etiology. The patient presents with refractory shock, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), right coronary artery (RCA) non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), respiratory failure post-tracheostomy, acute renal failure (ARF), limb ischemia, and encephalopathy. The patient is critically ill with MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome) and has been progressing to digital ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refractory shock: The patient's persistent need for vasopressors (levophed) indicates ongoing hypotension and shock. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and further deterioration of organ function.
2. CVA: The patient has experienced a cerebrovascular accident, which may result in neurological deficits or disability if not appropriately managed.
3. RCA NSTEMI: The patient's right coronary artery has been affected by a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. This can lead to compromised cardiac function and potential arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure post-tracheostomy suggests impaired gas exchange and ventilation. This may necessitate continued ventilatory support and careful monitoring of oxygenation.
5. ARF: Acute renal failure can result in the accumulation of waste products and electroly"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch, 78.1 kg male who is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications.

The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. However, it is stated that the patient was given fentanyl boluses and Ativan for tachypnea and possible increased discomfort. The patient also received heparin gtt without a bolus to address increased limb ischemia, which was thought to be a thromboembolic event. Pressors were also administered.

The patient's lactate level increased to 6.0, leading to a CT scan that showed no abscess. The patient was unable to give informed consent due to lack of responsiveness. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was initiated due to increased academia, aiming to run the patient even. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for a hematocrit (Hct) level of 22.

The patient has several allergies, including sulfasalazine, with unknown allergies. The last dose of antibiotics, vancomycin, was given on 08:00 PM 2193-8-16.

The patient is currently receiving multiple infusions, including heparin sodium at 650 units/hour, norepinephrine at 0.12 mcg/kg/min, and calcium gluconate (CRRT) at 2"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Neuro: Continues to have no consistent meaningful interaction. Seems
   to be nodding at times, but cannot follow any commands. By vital sign
   parameters, patient is uncomfortable. Has had multiple embolic CVA but
   location of which cannot explain her severe global neurologic
   depression.  Etiology of minimally responsive state is unclear- [**Name2 (NI) 923**]
   metabolic vs brainstem micro infarcts (though no evidence for this by
   MRI).  Prognosis for meaningful recovery is grim.
   -Neuro following
   -Trial of fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort
   #Pulm: Patient increasingly tachypneic overnight, even beyond her prior
   baseline (RR 30-40s at baseline). Has high minute ventilation which may
   be driven by central process. No hemoptysis overnight. Patient placed
   back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either CNS, metabolic or
   increased VD/VT.  Wil try fentanyl first, then bicarb.  If neither
   decrease MV then will get PetCo2 monitor to infer alveolar dead space.
   - check VBG this AM to see if acidemia increased
   - Patient now on CVVH
   - CT no abcess, b/l pleural effusions, unable to assess for PE as non
   contrast
   - consider end-tidal CO2 monitor if no response
   #Heme: Certainly, patient now in DIC.   Patient s/p 2 units of
   cryoprecipitate with some increase in fibrinogen. Platelets still low
   at 69 today. However, unclear if patient also with underlying
   coagulopathy which is etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in
   kidney, peripheral LE with evidence of LE ischemia.  Rcvd 1 unit
   yesterday
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - now on heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60 today. Check serial CBCs and stop
   heparin if Hct falls
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   #CV: Currently in distributive shock, with increasing pressor
   requirement despite fluids. Shock likely septic vs neurogenic in
   etiology.  Increased lactate to 6.0 worrisome for ischemic bowel or
   abcess. Has CAD s/p NSTEMI with BMS to RCA; has 3+MR, globally
   depressed systolic function by echo. However, no marked change from
   prior echo so not likely cardiogenic shock. Still in afib.  Started on
   stress dose steroids yesterday.
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be [**12-29**] pressors
   - CT scan, no abcess, follow up recs
   - Continue steroids 50 mg q6H for BP support/shock
   - Continue asa/plavix for CAD
   #Renal: ARF, anuric, HD dependent.
   - Patient now on CVVH since [**8-18**]
   #Endo: Continues to be hypoglycemia overnight requiring D10 drip to
   maintain normoglycemia (continues on tubefeeds). Unclear etiology---ddx
   includes adrenal failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of
   gluconeogenesis (not supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.
   Poor prognostic sign.
   -continue steroids for presumed adrenal insufficiency (day #2 today)
   -continue D10 gtt, with goal glucose of  100-200.
   #ID: s/p 7 days of Vanco for line infection. No fever or increased
   leukocytosis off antibiotics. However, concerning that lactate
   - monitor fever, white count
   #GI: PPI, tube feeds.  LFT
s elevated
 relatively stable.
   #Musculoskeletal: Rhabdo; CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of
   any extremity.  Hold off on ext MRI for now.
   -trend CK.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, and now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and other complications.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been given fentanyl boluses and Ativan for tachypnea and possible increased discomfort.
- Heparin has been started without a bolus to address increased limb ischemia thought to be due to a thromboembolic event.
- Pressors have been increased due to distributive shock, possibly septic or neurogenic in origin.
- Lactate levels have increased to 6.0, indicating possible ischemic bowel or abscess.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, anuric, and dependent on hemodialysis.
- There are signs of hypotension, hypoglycemia, and possible adrenal insufficiency.
- The patient has been on CVVH since August 18th.
- There is evidence of DIC, with low platelet count and fibrinogen levels.
- The patient's neurological status is poor, with minimal responsive state and multiple embolic cerebrovascular accidents.
- The patient has cardiac history of NSTEMI with coronary artery disease and has undergone stenting of the right coronary artery.
- There are concerns about renal failure, end"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Neuro: Continues to have poor mental status, not following commands.
   By vital sign parameters, patient is uncomfortable. Has had multiple
   embolic CVA but location of which cannot explain her severe global
   neurologic depression.  Etiology of minimally responsive state is
   unclear- [**Name2 (NI) 923**] metabolic vs brainstem micro infarcts (though no evidence
   for this by MRI).  Prognosis for meaningful recovery is grim.
   - Neuro is on board, will call with questions. Appreciate input.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   #Pulm: Patient intermittently tachypneic over past few days. high
   minute ventilation likely driven by central process. No hemoptysis.
   Patient is currently back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either
   CNS, metabolic or increased VD/VT.
   - check VBG this AM
   - continue CVVH
   - CT no abcess, b/l pleural effusions, unable to assess for PE as non
   contrast
   - trach mask trial today
   #Heme: patient in DIC.  Patient s/p 2 units of cryoprecipitate with
   some increase in fibrinogen. Platelets still low at 69 today. However,
   unclear if patient also with underlying coagulopathy which is etiology
   for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, peripheral LE with
   evidence of LE ischemia.
   - Rcvd 1 unit [**8-18**]
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - now on heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60 today. Check serial CBCs and stop
   heparin if Hct falls
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   #CV: Currently in distributive shock, with increasing pressor
   requirement despite fluids. Shock likely septic vs neurogenic in
   etiology.  Increased lactate to 6.0 worrisome for ischemic bowel or
   abcess, but in setting of steroids. Has CAD s/p NSTEMI with BMS to RCA;
   has 3+MR, globally depressed systolic function by echo. However, no
   marked change from prior echo so not likely cardiogenic shock. Still in
   afib.
   - dc stress dose steroids as Cortisols have all been normal
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be [**12-29**] pressors. Goal
   MAP >60
   - CT scan, no abcess
   - Continue asa/plavix for CAD
   - will attempt to replace a-line
   #Renal: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   - Patient now on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even today
   #Endo: Continues to be hypoglycemic over weekend, requiring D10 drip to
   maintain glucose. continues on tubefeeds. Unclear etiology---ddx
   includes adrenal failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of
   gluconeogenesis (not supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.
   Poor prognostic sign.
   - discontinue steroids
   - continue D10 gtt, with goal glucose of  100-200.
   - Endocrine consult today
   #Hyponatremia: 130 in the AM, 133 on repeat. Possible SIADH or adrenal
   insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   - add on serum osms, cannot get urine osms as is anuric.
   #ID: s/p 7 days of Vanco for line infection. No fever or increased
   leukocytosis off antibiotics. CT shows possible left upper load
   influtrate, but has not been febrile and no sputum production, so will
   not treat for now, but will get repeat cultures
   - monitor fever, white count
   - repeat sputum and blood cultures
   #GI: PPI, tube feeds.  LFT
s elevated
 relatively stable.
   #Musculoskeletal: Rhabdo; CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of
   any extremity.  Hold off on ext MRI for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, Ativan, heparin, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, KCl, lansoprazole, and lorazepam. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 bpm, hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 94/68 mmHg to 73/55 mmHg, tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.7°C. The patient's neurological status is described as agitated and unresponsive with no localizing response. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 3.4 mg/dL, potassium (K+) at 7.7 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 69 K/uL, glucose at 153 mg/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) at 24.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 24.7%, platelet count (Plt) at 88 K/uL, and troponin-T at 2.54. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.28, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 58 mmHg, and fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) at 24.7%. Other notable findings include elevated levels of D-dimer at 6175 ng/mL, lactic acid at 3.7 mmol/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 1883 IU/L, and liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 455 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 201 U/L. 

The patient has a history of thromboembolic events, and a CT pan scan was performed due to an increase in lactate levels. The scan showed no abscess, but it was unable to definitively rule out a pulmonary embolism (PE) as intravenous contrast could not be given. The patient has been started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of thromboembolic events, along with the presence of risk factors such as immobilization and atrial fibrillation, increases the likelihood of further thromboembolic complications. Close monitoring and appropriate anticoagulation are necessary to prevent further thrombotic events.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status appears to be deteriorating, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation and the ABG results indicating respiratory acidosis. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to assess the patient's respiratory function and adjust treatment accordingly.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels, along with the patient's history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, suggest the possibility of AKI. This can be further supported by the findings of elevated BUN and urea levels. Appropriate management of fluid balance, renal replacement therapy, and careful medication dosing are crucial in this scenario.

4. Infection: The elevated white blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status, not following
   commands. This AM appeared to be more alert but inconsistently.
   - Neuro is on board, will call with questions. Appreciate input.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   #Tachypnea: Patient intermittently tachypneic over past few days. High
   minute ventilation likely driven by central process. No hemoptysis.
   Patient is currently back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either
   CNS, metabolic or increased VD/VT.
   - continue vent while on CVVH to prevent disruption of line
   #DIC: patient in DIC by labs.  Patient s/p 2 units of cryoprecipitate
   with some increase in fibrinogen. Platelets 82  today. However, unclear
   if patient also with underlying coagulopathy which is etiology for
   initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, peripheral LE with evidence
   of LE ischemia.
   - Rcvd 1 unit [**8-18**]
   - now on heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60 today. Check serial CBCs and stop
   heparin if Hct falls
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as option limited.
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   #Shock: Currently in distributive shock, weaned levophed yesterday to
   0.1mg/kg/min. Shock possibly septic etiology; lacate 2.5 today, WBC
   going down, pt hypothermic (but on CVVH).
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be worsened by
   pressors. Goal MAP >60
   - will attempt to replace a-line (failed yesterday)
   #Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   - Patient now on CVVH since [**8-18**], will continue to run even today
   #Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology of hypoglycemia ---ddx includes adrenal
   failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of gluconeogenesis (not
   supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.
   - discontinued steroids
   - Endocrine consult: stop D10, ? hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia s/p GB
   surgery, send plasma insulin, c-peptide, proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and
   BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   - D10 stopped, glucose stable, continue to follow
   #Hyponatremia: Na 132 today. Possible SIADH or adrenal insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   - add on serum osms, cannot get urine osms as is anuric.
   #Line infection: s/p 7 days of Vanco for line infection. No fever or
   increased leukocytosis off antibiotics.
   - monitor fever, white count
   - repeat sputum and blood cultures
   #Transaminitis: PPI, tube feeds.  LFT
s elevated
 relatively stable.
   #Musculoskeletal: Rhabdo; CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of
   any extremity.  Hold off on ext MRI for now.
   -trend CK.
   - MI-2 anti body for dermatomyositis pending

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI and now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia. She has poor mental status, tachypnea, shock, renal failure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, line infection, transaminitis, and musculoskeletal issues including rhabdomyolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DIC: The patient is in DIC based on labs, and there is an increase in fibrinogen after receiving cryoprecipitate. However, the underlying coagulopathy causing the initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in the kidney, and peripheral LE with evidence of LE ischemia is unclear. The patient is on heparin and will have serial CBCs to monitor for bleeding. Cryo and platelet transfusions will be considered if fibrinogen levels are below 100 and platelet count is below 50 in case of bleeding or below 30 overall. Fibrinogen levels and DIC labs should be trended.

2. Shock: The patient is in distributive shock, weaned off levophed yesterday. The etiology of the shock is possibly septic. Lactate levels are elevated, and the patient is hypothermic. Levophed should be weaned down due to potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status, not following
   commands. This AM appeared to be more alert but inconsistently.
   - Neuro is on board, will call with questions. Appreciate input.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   #Tachypnea: Patient intermittently tachypneic over past few days. High
   minute ventilation likely driven by central process. No hemoptysis.
   Patient is currently back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either
   CNS, metabolic or increased VD/VT.
   - continue vent while on CVVH to prevent disruption of line
   #DIC: patient in DIC by labs.  Patient s/p 2 units of cryoprecipitate
   with some increase in fibrinogen. Platelets 82  today. However, unclear
   if patient also with underlying coagulopathy which is etiology for
   initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, peripheral LE with evidence
   of LE ischemia.
   - Rcvd 1 unit [**8-18**]
   - now on heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60 today. Check serial CBCs and stop
   heparin if Hct falls
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as option limited.
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   #Shock: Currently in distributive shock, weaned levophed yesterday to
   0.1mg/kg/min. Shock possibly septic etiology; lacate 2.5 today, WBC
   going down, pt hypothermic (but on CVVH).
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be worsened by
   pressors. Goal MAP >60
   - Attempt IR-guided a-line to help guide pressor therapy
   #Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   - Patient now on CVVH since [**8-18**], will continue to run even today
   - Renal following
   #Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology of hypoglycemia ---ddx includes adrenal
   failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of gluconeogenesis (not
   supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.
   - discontinued steroids
   - Endocrine consult: stop D10, ? hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia s/p GB
   surgery, send plasma insulin, c-peptide, proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and
   BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   - D10 stopped, glucose stable, continue to follow
   #Hyponatremia: Na 132 today. Possible SIADH or adrenal insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   - add on serum osms, cannot get urine osms as is anuric.
   #Line infection: s/p 7 days of Vanco for line infection. No fever or
   increased leukocytosis off antibiotics.
   - monitor fever, white count
   - repeat sputum and blood cultures
   - No further abx at this time
   #Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   # CMV infection: Viral load elevated at 2310, unclear as pt
   immunocompetant.
   - Start Ganciclovir now
   - ID consult for formal recommendations
   #Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.
   Hold off on ext MRI for now.
   -trend CK.
   - MI-2 anti body for dermatomyositis pending

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by a long hospital course and now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and an elevated respiratory rate. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to tachypnea.

The patient has several medical complications including altered mental status, tachypnea, DIC, shock, renal failure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, line infection, transaminitis, CMV infection, and rhabdomyolysis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, troponin T, blood glucose levels, liver enzymes, D-dimer, fibrinogen, lactate, albumin, lactic acid, LDH, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and others.

The patient's treatment plan involves managing her altered mental status with neurologic evaluation and support, continuing ventilatory support for tachypnea, administering cryoprecipitate for DIC, adjusting heparin therapy based on PTT levels, weaning levophed as appropriate, continuing CVVH for renal failure, investigating the cause of hypoglycemia, monitoring sodium levels, addressing line infection, following liver enzyme trends,"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Neuro: Continues to have poor mental status, not following commands.
   Has had multiple embolic CVA but location of which cannot explain her
   severe global neurologic depression.  Etiology of minimally responsive
   state is unclear- toxic metabolic vs brainstem micro infarcts (though
   no evidence for this by MRI).  Prognosis for meaningful recovery is
   grim.
   - Neuro is on board, will call with questions. Appreciate input.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   #Pulm: Patient intermittently tachypneic over past few days. High
   minute ventilation likely driven by central process. No hemoptysis.
   Patient is currently back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either
   CNS, metabolic or increased VD/VT.
   - continue CVVH
   - CT no abcess, b/l pleural effusions, unable to assess for PE as non
   contrast
   - trach mask trial
   #Heme: patient in DIC.  Patient s/p 2 units of cryoprecipitate with
   some increase in fibrinogen. Platelets 82  today. However, unclear if
   patient also with underlying coagulopathy which is etiology for initial
   MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, peripheral LE with evidence of LE
   ischemia.
   - Rcvd 1 unit [**8-18**]
   - heme following, appreciate recs
   - now on heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60 today. Check serial CBCs and stop
   heparin if Hct falls
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   #CV: Currently in distributive shock, weaned levophed yesterday to
   0.1mg/kg/min. Shock possibly septic etiology; lacate 2.5 today.
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be [**12-29**] pressors. Goal
   MAP >60
   - CT scan, no abcess
   - Continue asa/plavix for CAD
   - will attempt to replace a-line (failed yesterday)
   #Renal: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   - Patient now on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even today
   #Endo: Unclear etiology of hypoglycemia ---ddx includes adrenal
   failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of gluconeogenesis (not
   supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.
   - discontinued steroids
   - Endocrine consult: stop D10, ? hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia s/p GB
   surgery, send plasma insulin, c-peptide, proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and
   BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   - D10 stopped, glucose stable, continue to follow
   #Hyponatremia: 130 in the AM, 133 on repeat. Possible SIADH or adrenal
   insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   - add on serum osms, cannot get urine osms as is anuric.
   #ID: s/p 7 days of Vanco for line infection. No fever or increased
   leukocytosis off antibiotics. CT shows possible left upper load
   influtrate, but has not been febrile and no sputum production, so will
   not treat for now, but will get repeat cultures
   - monitor fever, white count
   - repeat sputum and blood cultures
   #GI: PPI, tube feeds.  LFT
s elevated
 relatively stable.
   #Musculoskeletal: Rhabdo; CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and now presents with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia.

Neurological assessment reveals poor mental status and global neurologic depression. The etiology of her minimally responsive state is unclear, with possibilities including toxic metabolic factors or brainstem microinfarcts. The prognosis for meaningful recovery is grim.

Pulmonary assessment indicates intermittent tachypnea over the past few days, possibly driven by central processes. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with high minute ventilation (23), which may be due to CNS, metabolic, or increased VD/VT issues. A CT scan showed no abscess, but there were bilateral pleural effusions, and the patient is unable to assess for pulmonary embolism as a non-contrast CT was performed.

Hematological assessment shows the patient in DIC. She received 2 units of cryoprecipitate with some increase in fibrinogen, and her platelet count is 82 today. However, it is unclear if she also has an underlying coagulopathy that is etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, peripheral LE with evidence of LE ischemia.

Cardiovascular assessment reveals distributive shock, possibly septic etiology. The patient's lactate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status, not following
   commands.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   #Tachypnea: Patient intermittently tachypneic over past few days. High
   minute ventilation likely driven by central process. No hemoptysis.
   Patient is currently back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either
   CNS, metabolic or increased VD/VT.
   - continue vent while on CVVH to prevent disruption of line
   #DIC: patient in DIC by labs. Platelets 85  today. However, unclear if
   patient also with underlying coagulopathy which is etiology for initial
   MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, peripheral LE with evidence of LE
   ischemia. Fibringogen 192, AM pending.
   - Rcvd 1 unit [**8-18**], 2 units cryo
   - was on heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60 today, stopped when Hct dropped
   to 20 from 23
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   #Shock: Currently in distributive shock, weaned levophed off. Shock
   possibly septic etiology; lactate rose to 4.6 today, WBC up to 15, pt
   spiked to 101. Possible pulm source as sputum cx with GNR yesterday.
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be worsened by
   pressors. Goal MAP >60
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - Initiated abx: Meropenem, Vanco, Cipro (renally dosed)
   #Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   - Patient now on CVVH since [**8-18**], will continue to run even today
   - Renal following
   - CVVH line cracked, pt to have new line placed this AM
   #Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology of hypoglycemia ---ddx includes adrenal
   failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of gluconeogenesis (not
   supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.  Has been stable for 2
   days.
   - discontinued steroids
   - Endocrine consult: stop D10, ? hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia s/p GB
   surgery, send plasma insulin, c-peptide, proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and
   BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   - D10 stopped, glucose stable, continue to follow
   #Hyponatremia: Na 131 today. Possible SIADH or adrenal insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   - add on serum osms, cannot get urine osms as is anuric.
   #Anemia: Hct dropped to 20 from 23 yesterday. Small amt vaginal
   blleding noted yesterday. Heparin stopped.
   - Transfusing 1 u pRBCs
   #Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   # CMV viremia: Viral load elevated at 2310, unclear as pt
   immunocompetant.
   - Started Ganciclovir yesterday (q 24h per Pharm)
   - ID consult for formal recommendations pending
   #Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K to 2778. No movement of any
   extremity.  Hold off on ext MRI for now.
   -trend CK.
   - MI-2 anti body for dermatomyositis pending

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI and now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. The patient's current medical conditions include altered mental status, tachypnea, DIC, shock, renal failure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, anemia, transaminitis, CMV viremia, and rhabdomyolysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Worsening multiorgan system failure: The patient's multiorgan system failure indicates a severe and potentially life-threatening condition. It is crucial to closely monitor and manage each organ system to prevent further deterioration.

2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): DIC is a serious condition characterized by the abnormal clotting of blood, leading to both bleeding and clotting issues. It can result in organ damage and increase the risk of complications such as hemorrhage or thrombosis.

3. Digital ischemia: Ischemia refers to inadequate blood supply to tissues, which can lead to tissue damage. In the case of digital ischemia, the blood flow to the fingers or toes is compromised, potentially resulting in tissue death (gangrene) or other complications.

4. Renal failure: Renal failure indicates impaired kidney function, leading to the accumulation of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status, not following
   commands.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   #Tachypnea: Patient intermittently tachypneic over past few days. High
   minute ventilation likely driven by central process. No hemoptysis.
   Patient is currently back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either
   CNS, metabolic or increased VD/VT.
   - continue vent while on CVVH to prevent disruption of line
   #DIC: patient in DIC by labs. Platelets 85  today. However, unclear if
   patient also with underlying coagulopathy which is etiology for initial
   MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, peripheral LE with evidence of LE
   ischemia. Fibringogen 192, AM pending.
   - Rcvd 1 unit [**8-18**], 2 units cryo
   - was on heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60 today, stopped when Hct dropped
   to 20 from 23
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   #Shock: Currently in distributive shock, weaned levophed off. Shock
   possibly septic etiology; lactate rose to 4.6 today, WBC up to 15, pt
   spiked to 101. Possible pulm source as sputum cx with GNR yesterday.
   CXR with new RLL infiltrate today.
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be worsened by
   pressors. Goal MAP >60
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - Initiated abx: Meropenem, Vanco, Cipro (renally dosed)
   #Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   - Patient now on CVVH since [**8-18**], will continue to run even today
   - Renal following
   - CVVH line cracked, repaired in AM, restarted CVVH
   #Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology of hypoglycemia ---ddx includes adrenal
   failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of gluconeogenesis (not
   supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.  Has been stable for 2
   days.
   - discontinued steroids
   - Endocrine consult: stop D10, ? hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia s/p GB
   surgery, send plasma insulin, c-peptide, proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and
   BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   - D10 stopped, glucose stable, continue to follow
   #Hyponatremia: Na 131 today. Possible SIADH or adrenal insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   - add on serum osms, cannot get urine osms as is anuric.
   #Anemia: Hct dropped to 20 from 23 yesterday. Small amt vaginal
   blleding noted yesterday. Heparin stopped.
   - Transfusing 1 u pRBCs
   #Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   # CMV viremia: Viral load elevated at 2310, unclear as pt
   immunocompetant.
   - Started Ganciclovir yesterday (q 24h per Pharm)
   - ID consult for formal recommendations pending
   #Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K to 2778. No movement of any
   extremity.  Hold off on ext MRI for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Last Name] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, and now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. The patient has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course.

24-hour events include:
- Arterial line placement on [2193-08-20] at 06:48 PM.
- Fever with a temperature of 101.1°F on [2193-08-21] at 06:30 AM.
- Small amount of vaginal bleeding noted yesterday.
- Started Ganciclovir q24h, awaiting ID recommendations.
- CVVH line cracked, CVVH held pending repair of line.
- Sputum culture on [08-19] with heavy growth of gram-negative bacteria, started [Last Name] 350/Cipro/Vanc.
- Hematocrit dropped to 20 from 23, transfused one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
- Lactate rose to 4.6.
- Transiently off, then on again with Levophed.
- Spiked to 101°F this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DIC: The patient is in DIC as indicated by low platelet count and elevated D-dimer levels. Fibrinogen levels are also low, which may indicate an underlying coagulopathy. The patient requires careful monitoring and management of coagulation parameters, including platelet transfusion for fibrinogen <100 and platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of DIC, such as sickle cell disease or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

2. Shock: The patient is currently in distributive shock, possibly septic etiology, with evidence of increased lactate levels and a rising white blood cell count. There is a possible pulmonary source, as indicated by the sputum culture showing growth of gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotic therapy has been initiated with meropenem, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), anuria, and is dependent on dialysis. CVVH has been running since [08-18] and will continue today. Renal follow-up is recommended, and a new CVVH line should be placed due to the cracked line.

4. Hypoglycemia: The etiology of hypoglycemia is unclear, but possible causes include adrenal failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of gluconeogenesis, or overwhelming shock. The patient's blood glucose levels have been stable for the past two days, so further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. Endocrine consult is advised to stop dextrose infusion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia. The patient's condition is unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs, abnormal laboratory results, and ongoing medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DIC: The patient is showing signs of DIC, which is characterized by abnormal blood clotting, leading to bleeding and organ damage. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management with blood products and anticoagulants are necessary.

2. Digital Ischemia: The patient has worsening foot ischemia, indicating reduced blood flow to the extremities. This can lead to tissue damage and potentially require amputation. Aggressive management of blood pressure and perfusion, along with consideration for revascularization procedures, may be required.

3. Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): The patient's multiorgan system failure suggests the development of MODS, a severe and life-threatening condition characterized by dysfunction of multiple organs. Close monitoring and supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and other organ-specific interventions, will be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC, fibrinogen trending up, FDP
   trending down. Pt may have with underlying coagulopathy as possible
   etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, LE ischemia.
   Rvcd 1 unit PRBCs [**8-21**], but Hct did not bump appropriately, will
   transfuse one more unit
   - Hct trending down again, will transfuse 1 more unit today
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, it was stopped when Hct
   dropped, but back on now, will continue given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status, but has interactive,
   answering yes/no questions. Likely secondary to strokes and
   toxicmetabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV, meropenem, cipro and vancomycin
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Vanco, Meropenem and Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**] for all)
   CMV viremia: Viral load elevated at 2310, unclear as pt
   immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**])
   VAP: Sputum from [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter. Will continue current antibiotics, as bacteria are
   sensitive to meropenem and cipro
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, levophed was weaned off, but
   now back on at very low dose 0.35mg/kg/min. Shock possibly septic
   etiology; lactate vascilating, WBC up to 15, pt spiked to 101. Possible
   pulm source as sputum with acinetobacter and enterobacter. CXR with
   ?RLL infiltrate.
   - Try to discontinue levophed as limb ischemia worsened by pressors.
   Goal MAP >60
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - On abx as above:  Meropenem, Vanco, Cipro
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will continue to run even today
   - Renal following
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Na low 130s. Possible SIADH or adrenal insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   - serum osms normal, cannot get urine osms as is anuric.
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP and TBili stable today, not
   trending down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.
   -trend CK.
   - MI-2 anti body for dermatomyositis pending

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 479**], a 44-year-old female, is admitted with NSTEMI and has a complicated hospital course. She now presents with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and several other medical complications. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, possible secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic factors, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, shock, renal failure requiring dialysis, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and rhabdomyolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's laboratory results show a low platelet count, elevated D-dimer, and prolonged clotting times. This suggests the presence of DIC, which can lead to bleeding and organ dysfunction.
2. Digital Ischemia: The patient's foot ischemia has worsened, indicating compromised blood flow to the extremities. This can potentially lead to tissue necrosis and amputation if not addressed promptly.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. If left untreated, this can progress to severe respiratory distress and sepsis.
4. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Viremia: The patient has an elevated viral"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   #Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status, not following
   commands.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   #Tachypnea: Patient intermittently tachypneic over past few days. High
   minute ventilation likely driven by central process. No hemoptysis.
   Patient is currently back on ventilator. High MV (23) may be either
   CNS, metabolic or increased VD/VT.
   - continue vent while on CVVH to prevent disruption of line
   #DIC: patient in DIC by labs. Platelets 85  today. However, unclear if
   patient also with underlying coagulopathy which is etiology for initial
   MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, peripheral LE with evidence of LE
   ischemia. Fibringogen 192, AM pending.
   - Rcvd 1 unit [**8-18**], 2 units cryo
   - was on heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60 today, stopped when Hct dropped
   to 20 from 23
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   - transfuse platelets <50 if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   #Shock: Currently in distributive shock, weaned levophed off. Shock
   possibly septic etiology; lactate rose to 4.6 today, WBC up to 15, pt
   spiked to 101. Possible pulm source as sputum cx with GNR yesterday.
   CXR with new RLL infiltrate today.
   - Try to wean down levophed as limb ischemia may be worsened by
   pressors. Goal MAP >60
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - Initiated abx: Meropenem, Vanco, Cipro (renally dosed)
   #Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   -Patient now on CVVH since [**8-18**], will continue to run even today
   - Renal following
   - CVVH line cracked, repaired in AM, restarted CVVH
   #Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology of hypoglycemia ---ddx includes adrenal
   failure/infarct, liver failure leading to lack of gluconeogenesis (not
   supported by labs today), overwhelming shock.  Has been stable for 2
   days.
   - discontinued steroids
   - Endocrine consult: stop D10, ? hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia s/p GB
   surgery, send plasma insulin, c-peptide, proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and
   BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   - D10 stopped, glucose stable, continue to follow
   #Hyponatremia: Na 131 today. Possible SIADH or adrenal insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   - add on serum osms, cannot get urine osms as is anuric.
   #Anemia: Hct dropped to 20 from 23 yesterday. Small amt vaginal
   blleding noted yesterday. Heparin stopped.
   - Transfusing 1 u pRBCs
   #Transaminitis: LFT

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated hospital course and is now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and other medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's lactate levels rose to 4.6 today, indicating possible septic shock. The presence of a new right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggests a potential pulmonary source of infection.
2. Acinetobacter baumannii infection: The patient's sputum culture revealed the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, a multi-drug resistant bacteria. This infection may contribute to her overall clinical deterioration.
3. DIC: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of DIC, characterized by low platelet count, elevated fibrinogen degradation products, and other coagulation abnormalities. This condition can lead to widespread bleeding and organ failure.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is dialysis-dependent and has acute renal failure. This may be due to sepsis-induced kidney injury or other underlying causes.
5. Digital Ischemia: The patient's worsening foot ischemia indicates compromised blood flow to the extremities. This could lead to tissue necrosis and possible amputation if not promptly addressed.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced episodes"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Rvcd 1 unit PRBCs [**8-21**], but Hct did not bump
   appropriately, transfused one unit yesterday
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, it was stopped when Hct
   dropped, but back on now, will continue given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status, but has interactive,
   answering yes/no questions. Likely secondary to strokes and
   toxicmetabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV, meropenem, cipro and vancomycin
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Vanco, Meropenem and Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**] for all)
   CMV viremia: Viral load elevated at 2310, unclear as pt
   immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**])
   - check q week viral loads (due [**8-23**])
   VAP: Sputum from [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter: abx changed to Cipro.
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, WBC up to 15, pt
   spiked to 101. Possible pulm source as sputum with acinetobacter and
   enterobacter. CXR with RLL infiltrate.
   - Try to discontinue levophed as limb ischemia worsened by pressors.
   Goal MAP >60
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - On abx as above:  Cipro
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even today
   - Renal following
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Stable in the low 130s. Possible SIADH or adrenal
   insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   - serum osms normal, cannot get urine osms as is anuric.
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP and TBili stable today, not
   trending down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.
   -trend CK.
   - MI-2 anti body for dermatomyositis pending

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Rvcd 1 unit PRBCs [**8-21**], but Hct did not bump
   appropriately, transfused one unit yesterday
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, it was stopped when Hct
   dropped, but back on now, will continue given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - f/u Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status, but has interactive,
   answering yes/no questions. Likely secondary to strokes and
   toxicmetabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV, meropenem, cipro and vancomycin
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Vanco, Meropenem and Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**] for all)
   CMV viremia: Viral load elevated at 2310, unclear as pt
   immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**])
   - check q week viral loads (due [**8-23**])
   VAP: Sputum from [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter: abx changed to Cipro.
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, WBC up to 15, pt
   spiked to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday, afebrile since. Possible pulm source as sputum
   with acinetobacter and enterobacter. CXR with RLL infiltrate.
   - Try to discontinue levophed as limb ischemia worsened by pressors.
   Goal MAP >60
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - On abx as above:  Cipro
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even today
   - Renal following
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Stable in the low 130s. Possible SIADH or adrenal
   insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP and TBili stable today, not
   trending down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.
   -trend CK.
   - MI-2 anti body for dermatomyositis pending

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, and now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. The patient has had a complicated and long hospital course.

Assessment and plan:
1. DIC/Anemia: The patient is in resolving DIC. She may have an underlying coagulopathy as a possible etiology for the initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in the kidney, and lower extremity ischemia. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on [8-21], but the hemoglobin did not bump appropriately. She received another unit of PRBCs yesterday.
   - Continue heparin drip, goal PTT 50-60. It was stopped when Hct dropped, but it has been restarted due to limb ischemia.
   - Trend DIC labs daily now, cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50 if bleeding or <30 overall.
   - Follow up Hg electrophoresis to rule out sickle cell.
   - ADAMTS13 pending for question of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), although unlikely with low fibrinogen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of unknown allergies, transaminitis, and various comorbidities. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient's vital signs show a fever, decreased blood pressure, and an increased heart rate. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen, and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Blood cultures were obtained on 08/23/2193 at multiple time points. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level. Other lab results show abnormalities in electrolyte levels and cardiac markers. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and sedatives. The patient's neurological status is described as awake but not following commands. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and elevated troponin-T levels suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection or sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output indicate potential kidney dysfunction.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) suggest possible liver injury or dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Rvcd 1 unit PRBCs [**8-21**], but Hct did not bump
   appropriately, transfused one unit yesterday
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, it was stopped when Hct
   dropped, but back on now, will continue given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell
   - ADAMST13 pending for question of TTP, although unlikely with low
   fibrinogen
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV, on meropenem, cipro and vancomycin
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**])
   CMV viremia: Viral load elevated at 2310, unclear as pt
   immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**])
   - check q week viral loads (due [**8-23**])
   VAP: Sputum from [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter: abx changed to Cipro.
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, WBC up to 15, pt
   spiked to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday, afebrile since. Possible pulm source as sputum
   with acinetobacter and enterobacter. CXR with RLL infiltrate.
   - Try to discontinue levophed as limb ischemia worsened by pressors.
   Goal MAP >60
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - On abx as above:  Cipro
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even today
   - Renal following
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   - Renal had recommended trying to cool pt and d/c pressors in order to
   take off fluid; given poor peripheral perfusion, we will defer cooling
   pt, no emergent indication for fluid removal at present
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Stable in the low 130s. Possible SIADH or adrenal
   insufficiency
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP and TBili stable today, not
   trending down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.
   -trend CK.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, and complicated hospital course. She now presents with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. The patient has been treated with various medications, including heparin, antibiotics, and antivirals. She is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has multiple lines and catheters in place. The patient's condition is unstable, with altered mental status, septic shock, renal failure, and other complications. 

Potential medical complications:
1. DIC: The patient has signs of DIC, including low platelet count, elevated D-dimer levels, and bleeding. She requires ongoing monitoring and management of coagulopathy.
2. Digital ischemia: The patient has digital ischemia, which requires careful management, especially considering the ongoing use of pressors that could worsen peripheral perfusion.
3. Septic shock: The patient is in distributive shock, likely due to sepsis, with a possible pulmonary source indicated by the presence of Acinetobacter and Enterobacter in the sputum culture. Source control and broad-spectrum antibiotics are needed.
4. Renal failure: The patient is anuric and dialysis-dependent, requiring close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management with CVVH.
5. Multiorgan dysfunction: The patient's multiple"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 479], a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, was admitted with NSTEMI and has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course. She is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DIC: The patient's condition is resolving DIC, which may be due to an underlying coagulopathy as a possible etiology for the initial myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), microangiopathy in the kidney, and lower extremity ischemia.
2. Shock: The patient is currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed. Septic shock is a possibility, with a lactate level fluctuating, white blood cell count elevated, and possible pulmonary source as indicated by sputum culture growing Acinetobacter and Enterobacter. The chest X-ray shows right middle lobe infiltrate, which has improved.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), anuria, and is dependent on dialysis. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been running since August 18th and will continue today.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient previously experienced hypoglycemia, but it has resolved. The etiology is unclear, and further evaluation is needed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, who has developed fevers, altered mental status, renal failure, and shock. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has multiple comorbidities including anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, CMV viremia, respiratory failure, and suspected VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia). The patient's condition is complex, with several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient's anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy are likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Improving with heparin. Hct stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o F admitted with NSTEMI, course complicated by fevers,
   persistently altered mental status, renal failure, shock.
   1. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy:  Likely due to DIC.  Improving
   with heparin.  Hct stable.
    - will cont heparin gtt
    - appreciate hematology input
    - no indications for cryoptts
    - t/f for sx anemia, hct < 21
    - will check iron studies, if low will replete, will start epo after
   this
   2. CMV viremia:  On ganciclovir, checking CMV viral load q week.
   3. Respiratory failure: On PSV.  When on trach collar her coughing
   tends to shut off her CVVH circuit.
   4. Shock/VAP: Continues to require levophed although dose is lower.
   Likely sepsis from VAP.
   - levo not to go above 0.6 s/p family meeting, no escalation of care
   - off stress dose steroids
   - cont cipro 6/8 days for acinetobacter & enterobacter
   5. Elevated CK:  Now trending down.  Likely due to DIC and/or CMV.
   6. ARF:  On CVVH due to hypotension.  Currently has no pressing reason
   to remove fluid (oxygenation good), so will continue to run CVVH even.
   continues to be anuric
   continuing cvvh for now, but will cont to address goals of care
   7. Decreased level of consciousness:  Stable.
   8.  NSTEMI- on asa/plavix.
   9. Hypoglycemia:  Resolved.
   10.  Elevated LFTs:  Also improving, likely due to CMV.
   11. Ischemic extremities:  Likely due to DIC causing hypercoaguable
   state and to levophed.  Continue heparin gtt.  Wean levo if tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, who has developed fevers, altered mental status, renal failure, and shock. She is currently intubated, sedated, and poorly responsive. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. She has been diagnosed with anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, CMV viremia, respiratory failure, shock, elevated CK levels, acute renal failure, decreased level of consciousness, NSTEMI, hypoglycemia, elevated liver function tests, and ischemic extremities. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, anticoagulants, and cardiovascular drugs. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function tests. Imaging shows an improving right middle lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's current condition and potential complications require careful management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient has likely disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can lead to bleeding and clotting complications.
2. CMV Viremia: The patient is on ganciclovir therapy for CMV infection, which can cause bone marrow suppression and increase the risk of bleeding.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, it was stopped when Hct
   dropped, but back on now, will continue given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell: negative
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   Respiratory Failure: stable on pressure support [**4-1**]. Will continue on
   PS while in CCVH
   - will keep on PS 5/5 while on CVVH.
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV viremia, on Cipro & gancyclovir. Sputum from
   [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and Enterobacter
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**], plan for 8 d course, stop [**8-27**])
   - CMV viremia: Viral load elevated, unclear as pt immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**])
   - check q week viral loads (due [**8-29**])
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, WBC up to 15, pt
   spiked to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday, afebrile since. Possible pulm source as sputum
   with acinetobacter and enterobacter. CXR with RLL infiltrate, improved.
   - Try to discontinue levophed as limb ischemia worsened by pressors.
   Goal MAP >55. off it this AM
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - On abx as above:  Cipro, consider broadening coverage if BP worsens
   - will recheck cortisol level today. Will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] stim if low.
   - Will consider starting steroids empirically for vasculitis.
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even today
   - Renal following, appreciate input
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   - Renal had recommended trying to cool pt and d/c pressors in order to
   take off fluid; given poor peripheral perfusion, we will defer cooling
   pt, no emergent indication for fluid removal at present
   - Consider Epogen for anemia, iron studies sent off
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Na 136 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 479**] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI and now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues including respiratory failure, altered mental status, infections (Ventilator-associated pneumonia and Cytomegalovirus viremia), shock, renal failure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and rhabdomyolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is stable on pressure support ventilation but continues to show signs of respiratory distress. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function leading to respiratory failure.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has poor mental status likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. There is a risk of continued neurological decline or development of new neurological deficits.
3. Infections: The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia and CMV viremia. There is a risk of progression or worsening of these infections.
4. Shock: The patient is currently in distributive shock, possibly septic etiology. There is a risk of continued hemodynamic instability and potential organ dysfunction.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is dialysis-dependent. There is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and other medical complications. She is currently in the ICU, requiring various interventions and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening multiorgan system failure: The patient has already experienced failure in multiple organs, including the respiratory, renal, and hepatic systems. Continued deterioration in these systems could lead to further complications and a poor prognosis.
2. DIC: The patient is showing signs of DIC, which is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to severe bleeding or organ damage.
3. Digital ischemia: The patient's digital ischemia (lack of blood flow to the fingers) is causing limb ischemia. If left untreated, this could result in tissue damage or even amputation.
4. Infections: The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. These infections need to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.
5. Septic shock: The patient's condition suggests possible septic shock, indicated by the presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count. Prompt identification and management of the underlying infection are crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, it was stopped when Hct
   dropped, but back on now, will continue given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell: negative
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsley low in DIC and
   hemolysis, although unlikely with low fibrinogen
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV viremia, on Cipro & gancyclovir
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**], plan for 8 d course, stop [**8-27**])
   - CMV viremia: Viral load elevated, unclear as pt immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]), for presumed 14 day course but
   source unknown, and has not had dilated eye exam
   - check q week viral loads (due [**8-29**])
   -VAP: Sputum from [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter: abx changed to Cipro.
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, WBC has been
   increasing, but no new + culture data, had temp to 101 on [**8-23**] but
   afebrile since. Possible pulm source as sputum with acinetobacter and
   enterobacter. CXR with RLL infiltrate, improved.
   - Try to discontinue levophed as limb ischemia worsened by pressors.
   Goal MAP >60
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - On abx as above:  Cipro, consider broadening coverage if BP worsens
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, cvvh  dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even today
   - Renal following
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   - Renal had recommended trying to cool pt and d/c pressors in order to
   take off fluid; given poor peripheral perfusion, we will defer cooling
   pt, no emergent indication for fluid removal at present
   - iron studies demonstrate low Iron,nl TIBC, got t/f on [**8-24**] so Iron
   likely replete, will give iron supplementation and start epo.
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Na 136 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP up, Tbili down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.
   -trend CK.
   Respiratory Failure: much improved, PS 5/5 however maintain vent while
   on CVVH

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, and now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia. The patient has had several complications during her hospital stay, including a stroke, respiratory failure, renal failure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, rhabdomyolysis, and septic shock.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, requiring CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 40%. Her blood pressure is unstable and requires continuous infusion of levophed. The patient also has anemia and is receiving packed red blood cells transfusion. She has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, D-dimer, and lactate levels, indicating possible infection, coagulation disorder, and tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's renal function is impaired, as she is dependent on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient's mental status remains poor, with suspected secondary strokes and toxic/metabolic factors contributing to her altered mental state. She has digital ischemia with dusky nail beds, further darkening of the toes and fingertips, and progression of purple discoloration proximally.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, it was stopped when Hct
   dropped, but back on now, will continue given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell: negative
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsley low in DIC and
   hemolysis, although unlikely with low fibrinogen
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV viremia, on Cipro & gancyclovir
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**], plan for 8 d course, stop [**8-27**])
   - CMV viremia: Viral load elevated, unclear as pt immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]), for presumed 14 day course but
   source unknown, and has not had dilated eye exam
   - check q week viral loads (due [**8-29**])
   -VAP: Sputum from [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter: abx changed to Cipro.
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, WBC has been
   increasing, but no new + culture data, had temp to 101 on [**8-23**] but
   afebrile since. Possible pulm source as sputum with acinetobacter and
   enterobacter. CXR with RLL infiltrate, improved.
   - Try to discontinue levophed as limb ischemia worsened by pressors.
   Goal MAP >60
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - On abx as above:  Cipro, consider broadening coverage if BP worsens
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, cvvh  dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even today
   - Renal following
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   - Renal had recommended trying to cool pt and d/c pressors in order to
   take off fluid; given poor peripheral perfusion, we will defer cooling
   pt, no emergent indication for fluid removal at present
   - iron studies demonstrate low Iron,nl TIBC, got t/f on [**8-24**] so Iron
   likely replete, will give iron supplementation and start epo.
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Na 136 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP up, Tbili down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.
   -trend CK.
   Respiratory Failure: much improved, PS 5/5 however maintain vent while
   on CVVH

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient is in resolving DIC with a low platelet count and prolonged PTT. This condition can lead to bleeding or thrombosis.

2. Multiorgan System Failure: The patient has worsening multiorgan system failure, which may involve the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and other organs. This can result in organ dysfunction and potentially lead to organ failure.

3. Digital Ischemia: The patient has digital ischemia, indicating reduced blood flow to the fingers. This can cause tissue damage and potentially lead to amputation.

4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, an infection that occurs in individuals who are receiving mechanical ventilation. This infection can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of complications.

5. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Viremia: The patient is experiencing CMV viremia, a viral infection that can suppress the immune system and cause various symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and organ dysfunction.

6. Sepsis: The patient's shock status suggests a possible septic etiology, indicating that the infection may have led to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

7. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and dependent on continuous renal replacement"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell:
   negative.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   Respiratory Failure: Patient having periods of apnea yesterday, was
   switched to AC
   - stable on AC for now 500/12/5/40%.
   - will pressure support again today and check gas when having apnea to
   see if apnea is compensating for metabolic alkalosis.
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV viremia, on Cipro & gancyclovir. Sputum from
   [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and Enterobacter
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**], plan for 8 d course, stop [**8-27**])
   - CMV viremia: Viral load elevated, unclear as pt immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course
   - check q week viral loads (due [**8-29**])
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, afebrile since.
   Possible pulm source as sputum with acinetobacter and enterobacter. CXR
   with RLL infiltrate, improved.
   - Off levophed  for now, will try to keep off as limb ischemia worsened
   by pressors. Goal MAP >55.
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - normal cortisol level [**8-25**]: 40
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will take off fluid today 50cc/hour
   - Renal following, appreciate input: want to attend family meeting talk
   about CVVH is not helping overall picture.
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Na 135 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP up, Tbili down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.
   -trend CK.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname 479], a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, was admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and now presents with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, infections (VAP and CMV viremia), shock, renal failure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and rhabdomyolysis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and various medications for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing intermittent periods of apnea, indicating difficulty in breathing. She is currently on assisted ventilation (AC) with pressure support. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to have poor mental status, likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic factors. This poses a risk of delirium or further decline in cognitive function.
3. Infections: The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. If left untreated or inadequately managed, these infections can worsen and lead to sepsis.
4. Shock: The patient is"

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated and long hospital course, and now with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing intermittent periods of apnea and has been switched to assisted ventilation. She is stable on AC at 500/12/5/40%.
2. Altered mental status: The patient continues to have poor mental status, likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic causes. She is receiving fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, to be used sparingly.
3. Infection: The patient has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and CMV viremia. She is on Cipro and gancyclovir. Sputum from 8/19 is growing pansensitive Actinobacter and Enterobacter.
4. Shock: The patient is in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed. Possible septic etiology, with lactate fluctuating. She may have a pulmonary source as sputum is positive for Acinetobacter and Enterobacter. CXR shows right lower lobe infiltrate, improved.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), anuric, dialysis dependent since 8/18. She"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell: negative
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   Respiratory Failure: Patient having periods of apnea yesterday, was
   switched to AC
   - stable on AC for now 500/12/5/40%.
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV viremia, on Cipro & gancyclovir. Sputum from
   [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and Enterobacter
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**], plan for 8 d course, stop [**8-27**])
   - CMV viremia: Viral load elevated, unclear as pt immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course
   - check q week viral loads (due [**8-29**])
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, afebrile since.
   Possible pulm source as sputum with acinetobacter and enterobacter. CXR
   with RLL infiltrate, improved.
   - Off levophed  for now, will try to keep off as limb ischemia worsened
   by pressors. Goal MAP >55.
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - On abx as above:  Cipro, consider broadening coverage if BP worsens
   - normal cortisol level [**8-25**]: 40
   - Will consider starting steroids empirically for vasculitis.
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even today
   - Renal following, appreciate input
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   - Renal had recommended trying to cool pt and d/c pressors in order to
   take off fluid; given poor peripheral perfusion, we will defer cooling
   pt, no emergent indication for fluid removal at present
   - Consider Epogen for anemia, iron studies sent off
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Na 135 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP up, Tbili down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: CK improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.
   -trend CK.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by a long hospital course, and now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, infection (VAP and CMV viremia), shock (possibly septic etiology), renal failure (acute renal failure, anuric, dialysis dependent), hypoglycemia (resolved), hyponatremia (Na 135 now and stabilizing), transaminitis (liver enzymes trending down), and rhabdomyolysis (CK improving from peak of 16K).

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including heparin, ciprofloxacin, ganciclovir, fentanyl, ativan, and regular insulin sliding scale. She is also on nutritional support through enteral feeding.

The patient has several lines and catheters in place, including a multi-lumen line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line. She has received blood product transfusions and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of mental status, progression of DIC and digital ischemia, worsening infection, development of septic shock, progression of renal failure, fluctuations in blood sugar levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell:
   negative.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   Respiratory Failure: Patient having periods of apnea yesterday, was
   switched to AC
   - stable on AC for now 500/12/5/40%.
   - will pressure support again today and check gas when having apnea to
   see if apnea is compensating for metabolic alkalosis.
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   ID: patient with VAP, CMV viremia, on Cipro & gancyclovir. Sputum from
   [**8-19**] growing pansensitive Actinobacter and Enterobacter
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Cipro (Day 1 [**8-20**], plan for 8 d course, stop [**8-27**])
   - CMV viremia: Viral load elevated, unclear as pt immunocompetant.
   - continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course
   - check q week viral loads (due [**8-29**])
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, afebrile since.
   Possible pulm source as sputum with acinetobacter and enterobacter. CXR
   with RLL infiltrate, improved.
   - Off levophed  for now, will try to keep off as limb ischemia worsened
   by pressors. Goal MAP >55.
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - normal cortisol level [**8-25**]: 40
    Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.
   -Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will take off fluid today 50cc/hour
   - Renal following, appreciate input: want to attend family meeting talk
   about CVVH is not helping overall picture.
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**]
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Na 135 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479], a 44-year-old female, has been admitted with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and NSTEMI. Her hospital course has been complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and various other medical complications. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing worsening respiratory failure, altered mental status, septic shock, renal failure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, rhabdomyolysis, and multiple other conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing periods of apnea and is on assisted ventilation. There is a need to monitor gas exchange closely and consider increasing pressure support if necessary.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's poor mental status is likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic causes. Comfort measures, such as fentanyl and ativan boluses, should be used sparingly.
3. Septic Shock: The patient is in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed, and may have a septic etiology. Possible pulmonary sources include sputum with Acinetobacter and Enterobacter. Close monitoring of lactate levels and consideration of source control are important.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, anuria, and is dialysis-dependent. CVVH has been initiated,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted for NSTEMI, and now with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digital ischemia.
- The patient has been febrile, with a temperature of 102.2 degrees yesterday, now off continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She has CMV viremia on gancyclovir and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Actinobacter and Enterobacter, despite an 8-day course of ciprofloxacin.
- The patient is in distributive shock, intermittently on dopamine (Levophed). Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate is fluctuating, afebrile since. Possible pulmonary source as sputum with Acinetobacter and Enterobacter. Chest X-ray shows right lower lobe infiltrate, improved.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), anuric, dialysis-dependent. Dialysis catheter fell out yesterday, but replaced today. The patient has been on CVVH since August 18th and will take off fluid today at 50cc/hour. Renal following appreciated for input on CVVH effectiveness.
- The patient is in resolving DIC. She may have an underlying coagulopathy as a possible etiology for initial myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), microangiopathy in the kidney, and lower extremity (LE) ischemia. Hemoglobin electrophoresis to rule out sickle cell: negative.
- The patient's respiratory failure continues with periods of apnea yesterday, switched to assist-control (AC) ventilation. Stable on AC for now, set at 500 mL tidal volume, 12 breaths per minute, 5 cmH2O PEEP, 40% FiO2. Will try pressure support again today.
- The patient's altered mental status continues with poor mental status, likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic causes. Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly.
- Hypoglycemia resolved, but etiology unclear. Will now check fasting serum (FS) from ear or venous.
- Hyponatremia improving, sodium now at 135 and stabilizing.
- Transaminitis liver function tests (LFTs) trending down, alkaline phosphatase (AP) up, total bilirubin (Tbili) down.
- Rhabdomyolysis (Rhabdo) improving, creatine kinase (CK) improving from peak of 16K. No movement of any extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever, CMV viremia, and VAP, indicating a possible ongoing infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is in distributive shock, which could progress to septic shock if not properly managed. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters is crucial.
3. Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's multiorgan involvement, including respiratory, renal, hepatic, and hematological dysfunction, there is a risk of MODS. Aggressive management of each organ system is essential.
4. DIC: The patient is in resolving DIC, but there is still a risk of bleeding or clotting complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management of bleeding or clotting events is necessary.
5. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and VAP indicate potential pulmonary complications. Adequate ventilation and infection control measures are important to prevent further complications.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management of fluid balance and electrolytes.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   ID: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q week viral loads (due [**8-29**])
   - follow up culture from [**8-27**]: blood, sputum, stool for c diff
   - Ethics have already seen patient regarding HIV testing, will  pull up
   note. CD4 count normal.
   Shock: Currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed.
   Shock possibly septic etiology; lactate vascilating, afebrile since.
   Possible pulm source as sputum with acinetobacter and enterobacter. CXR
   with RLL infiltrate, improved.
   - back on levophed  0.04, will try to keep off as limb ischemia
   worsened by pressors. Goal MAP >55.
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - normal cortisol level [**8-25**]: 40
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath fell out
   yesterday.
   - IR replaced line today
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will take off fluid today 50cc/hour
   - Renal following, appreciate input: want to attend family meeting talk
   about CVVH is not helping overall picture.
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-NMDAR, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell:
   negative.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
    Respiratory Failure: Patient having periods of apnea yesterday, was
   switched to AC
   - stable on AC for now 500/12/5/40%: will try pressure support again
   today.
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Na 135 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP up, Tbili down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: resolved

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated and long hospital course, now with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and suspected central nervous system (CNS) involvement. She is currently in distributive shock, intermittently on levophed, and has an altered mental status likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic factors. The patient is experiencing renal failure, anuria, dialysis-dependent, and has had a replaced dialysis catheter. She also has suspected CNS involvement, respiratory failure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and rhabdomyolysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued multiorgan system failure
2. Progression of DIC with potential bleeding or clotting complications
3. Complications related to digital ischemia
4. CNS involvement with potential seizures or neurological deterioration
5. Further deterioration in renal function requiring ongoing dialysis support
6. Infection control measures due to suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
7. Management of shock state and hemodynamic instability
8. Monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances
9. Nutritional support considering the patient's compromised renal function
10. Monitoring and management of blood glucose levels.
The patient's condition is critical and requires close monitoring and"

   - PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**])
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q week viral loads (due [**8-29**])
   - follow up culture from [**8-27**]: blood, sputum, stool for c diff
   (positive)
   Shock: Patient with increased lactate this morning to 7; previously in
   4 range. Hypotensive requiring pressors. Considering global
   hypoperfusion, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential sources. Per
   renal, very small amount of lactate in CVVG
   - Patient responded well to albumen bolus (lactate 7->4); implying that
   she may be globally hypoperfused. Given this, we will give her 1 unit
   PRBCs.
   - will consider ECHO.
   - back on levophed  0.04, will try to keep off as limb ischemia
   worsened by pressors. Goal MAP >55.
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - IR-guided a-line placed
   - normal cortisol level [**8-25**]: 40
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will run even.
   - Renal following, appreciate input:
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
   Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-NMDAR, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell:
   negative.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
    Respiratory Failure: Patient having periods of apnea yesterday, was
   switched to AC
   - stable on AC for now 500/12/5/40%: will try pressure support again
   today.
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
   Hyponatremia: Na 135 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's increased lactate levels indicate global hypoperfusion, which may be due to various factors such as bowel pathology, dialysis, or sepsis. Pressors are being used to maintain blood pressure, but there is concern for limb ischemia.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and dependent on dialysis. ARF (acute renal failure) is present, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is being utilized.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to have poor mental status, likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Anti-neuronal antibodies should be tested.
4. DIC/Anemia: The patient appears to be resolving DIC, but with underlying coagulopathy. Heparin therapy is being continued, and further evaluation of the coagulation profile is recommended.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing periods of apnea and requires pressure support ventilation. A tracheostomy tube is in place.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient previously experienced hypoglycemia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ system failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires various interventions and treatments.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F), blood pressure ranging from 88/54 to 106/65 mmHg, heart rate between 98 and 104 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's physical examination reveals cyanosis in the extremities, necrosis on the skin, and neurologic dysfunction, including encephalopathy. The patient is unresponsive to verbal stimuli and does not follow commands.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, increased potassium and lactate levels, high blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient also has elevated levels of cardiac markers (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) and coagulation abnormalities (PT, PTT, INR). Other lab values show abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and cardiac enzymes.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics (gancyclovir, ciprofloxacin), vasopressors (levophed), dialysis, and respiratory support. The patient is also receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has been given regular"

   Assessment and Plan
   44-year-old woman with progressive multiple organ-system failure of
   uncertain etiology.  Her background hx is notable for asthma and
   gastric bypass surgery; she was admitted with an acute MI but has had a
   long and complicated course including strokes, pulmonary lesions,
   shock, digital and pedal ischemia, and profound hemostatic
   abnormalities attributed to DIC.  Although she has been seen by many
   consultants, no unifying diagnosis has become clear.
   The most concerning acute event is the worsened lactic acidosis.  We
   will plan:
     * Discuss CVVHD replacement fluid with renal regarding lactate
       content
     * Volume challenge, using lactate as the outcome measure.  Use 500 cc
       dilute albumin as challenge, measuring lactate before and after.
       If responds, transfuse.  If doesn
t respond, would have concern
       that this may represent extension of thrombosis.
   Additional major current issues include
     * DIC: On heparin.  TTP/HUS was previously entertained but felt not
       likely to play a role
     * Infections
     * CMV viremia on ganciclovir
     * VAP (enterobacter and pan-sensitive acinetobacter): completing ABX
       today
     Shock
     * See plans regarding lactic acidosis above
     * Does not appear to be adrenal insufficiency
     ARF on CVVH
     * Line replaced by IR yesterday
     * Per discussion with renal, biopsy showed thrombotic microangiopathy
     * Altered mental status
     * Possibly improving a bit on exam
     * MRI shows CVAs, but not clear that these should account for her
       depressed mental status
     * Appreciate neurology
s help in evaluating prognosis.  I am not
       convinced, at this point, that meaningful neurologic recovery is
       impossible (though I do think it is far from likely)
     Respiratory failure
     * Digital and pedal ischemia
     * Appears to have demarcated.  Follow.
     * I suspect much of this is thrombotic rather than ischemic from
       vasopressors.
     * Acute MI, s/p stents
 on ASA, Plavix
     * Will review with cardiology whether we can d/c Plavix, since can be
       associated with TMA
   Remains perplexing what the underlying etiology of this is.  See me
   note from 9/31.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old woman with progressive multiple organ-system failure of uncertain etiology. She has a background of asthma and gastric bypass surgery. She was admitted with an acute myocardial infarction but has had a long and complicated course including strokes, pulmonary lesions, shock, digital and pedal ischemia, and profound hemostatic abnormalities attributed to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's current condition includes:
- Multiple organ failure
- Lactate levels have worsened overnight
- Hemodynamic stability on stable levophed dose
- Encephalopathy, unable to provide history
- Infections: CMV viremia on ganciclovir, VAP (enterobacter and pan-sensitive acinetobacter)
- Shock
- Acute respiratory failure
- ARF on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)
- Altered mental status with possible improvement
- History of acute myocardial infarction with stents, on ASA and Plavix
- Digital and pedal ischemia with demarcation
- Thrombotic microangiopathy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Extension of thrombosis leading to further organ failure.
2. Development of new infections due to immunocompromised state.
3. Progression of shock and hemodynamic instability.
4. Worsening encephalopathy and potential neurological decline.
5. Complications related to DIC, such as bleeding or clot"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   ID: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**].
   - PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**])
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q week viral loads (due [**8-30**])
   - follow up culture from [**8-27**]: blood, sputum, stool for c diff
   (positive)
   - CXR shows ? PNA, will add on diff, repeat sputum culture. Will hold
   of on treating empirically for now, but will have low threshold to
   start (any resp distress, desat)
   Shock: Patient with increased lactate this morning to 7; previously in
   4 range. Hypotensive requiring pressors. Considering global
   hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential
   sources. Per renal, very small amount of lactate in CVVG
   - Patient responded well to albumen bolus (lactate 7->4); implying that
   she may be globally hypoperfused. Given this, she got 1 unit PRBCs.
   - If lactate goes up or becomes hypotensive will transfuse 1 unit
   PRBCs. i
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**], considering vasopressin suppression in
   setting of illness, will try trial of vasopressin if requires pressors
   again, and blood pressure does not respond to volume.
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], run even
   - Renal following, appreciate input:
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
    Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-NMDAR, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell:
   negative.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   - Hct low today, lactate is down, so will watch for now.
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient having periods of apnea yesterday, was
   switched to AC
   - tolerating pressure support today, try trach mask if tolerates
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HHV6 infection. It is possible to see this kind of picture with
   something invading her bone marrow, likely something infectious.
   Talking to heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy. Also talking to
   thrombosis specialist about possible etiologies. Would push having
   meeting with several specialist.
   - bone marrow biopsy,
   - HHV6 pending.
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
    Hyponatremia: Na 135 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP up, Tbili down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: resolved

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted for NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia. The patient is febrile and has been diagnosed with CMV viremia. She has also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and has been started on vancomycin. The patient's condition continues to deteriorate, with increased lactate levels indicating global hypoperfusion. She requires vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and has been dialysis-dependent since August 18th. The patient is experiencing poor mental status, likely due to strokes and toxic-metabolic factors. She has been prescribed fentanyl and ativan for comfort. There are plans to send anti-voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC), anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hu, and anti-HSV6 antibodies. The patient's DIC is resolving, but she may have an underlying coagulopathy. Her hemoglobin electrophoresis was negative for sickle cell disease. She will continue to receive heparin, with a goal PTT of 50-60.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia.
   ID: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**].
   - PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**])
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q week viral loads (due [**8-30**])
   - follow up culture from [**8-27**]: blood, sputum, stool for c diff
   (positive)
   Shock: Patient with increased lactate this morning to 7; previously in
   4 range. Hypotensive requiring pressors. Considering global
   hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential
   sources. Per renal, very small amount of lactate in CVVG
   - Patient responded well to albumen bolus (lactate 7->4); implying that
   she may be globally hypoperfused. Given this, we will give her 1 unit
   PRBCs.
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**], considering vasopressin suppression in
   setting of illness, will try trial of vasopressin if requires pressors
   again.
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - normal cortisol level [**8-25**]: 40
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], run even
   - Renal following, appreciate input:
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
    Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-NMDAR, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell:
   negative.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   - Hct low today, lactate is down, so will watch for now.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient having periods of apnea yesterday, was
   switched to AC
   - stable on AC for now 500/12/5/40%: will try pressure support again
   today.
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
    Hyponatremia: Na 135 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP up, Tbili down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: resolved

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and various other medical complications. She is currently in the ICU for ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60 since 10pm. She also had an increased lactate level this morning, indicating possible global hypoperfusion.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), anuria, and is dependent on dialysis. She is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
3. Poor Mental Status: The patient continues to have poor mental status likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic factors. Neurological recommendations are appreciated.
4. DIC/Anemia: The patient is in resolving DIC. She may have an underlying coagulopathy as the possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in kidney, and LE ischemia. Hg electrophoresis is negative to rule out sickle cell disease.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing periods of apnea, and was switched to airway clearance (AC) from mechanical ventilation. She will be tried on pressure support again today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory failure, thrombotic microangiopathy, and renal failure. The patient tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and has started treatment for it. The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and they are receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial condition of septic shock indicates a severe infection that could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is currently failing, requiring mechanical ventilation and pressure support. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and close monitoring of secretions is necessary.
3. Thrombotic microangiopathy: This condition involves blood clotting within small blood vessels and can lead to organ damage. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
4. Renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, requiring dialysis support. Monitoring fluid balance and electrolyte levels is crucial to prevent complications.
5. C. diff infection: The patient's positive test for C. diff indicates a gastrointestinal infection caused by the bacteria. Proper treatment and infection control measures are essential to prevent the spread of the infection.
6. Critically ill status: The patient's overall critical condition puts them"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   ID: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**].
   - PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**])
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q week viral loads (due [**8-30**])
   - follow up culture from [**8-27**]: blood, sputum, stool for c diff
   (positive)
   - CXR shows ? PNA, will add on diff, repeat sputum culture. Will hold
   of on treating empirically for now, but will have low threshold to
   start (any resp distress, desat)
   Shock: Patient with increased lactate this morning to 7; previously in
   4 range. Hypotensive requiring pressors. Considering global
   hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential
   sources. Per renal, very small amount of lactate in CVVG
   - Patient responded well to albumen bolus (lactate 7->4); implying that
   she may be globally hypoperfused. Given this, she got 1 unit PRBCs.
   - If lactate goes up or becomes hypotensive will transfuse 1 unit
   PRBCs. i
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**], considering vasopressin suppression in
   setting of illness, will try trial of vasopressin if requires pressors
   again, and blood pressure does not respond to volume.
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], run even
   - Renal following, appreciate input:
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
    Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-NMDAR, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell:
   negative.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   - Hct low today, lactate is down, so will watch for now.
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient having periods of apnea yesterday, was
   switched to AC
   - tolerating pressure support today, try trach mask if tolerates
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HHV6 infection. It is possible to see this kind of picture with
   something invading her bone marrow, likely something infectious.
   Talking to heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy. Also talking to
   thrombosis specialist about possible etiologies. Would push having
   meeting with several specialist.
   - bone marrow biopsy,
   - HHV6 pending.
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
    Hyponatremia: Na 135 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP up, Tbili down.
   - Continue to follow labs
   Rhabdo: resolved

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted for NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and now presents with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's condition is characterized by fever, hypotension, respiratory distress, renal failure, altered mental status, thrombotic microangiopathy, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and rhabdomyolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing periods of apnea and has been switched to assisted ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration due to pneumonia or worsening of underlying lung condition.

2. Shock: The patient is hypotensive and requires pressors, indicating potential global hypoperfusion. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed properly.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and dependent on dialysis. There is a risk of further renal deterioration due to ongoing hemodynamic instability and potential complications associated with dialysis.

4. DIC: The patient is in resolving DIC, which may still predispose her to bleeding and thrombotic events. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management of bleeding or thrombotic complications is necessary.

   IN PAIRS and budding yeast
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   ID: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**].
   - PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**])
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q week viral loads (due [**8-30**])
   - follow up culture from [**8-27**]: blood, sputum, stool for c diff
   (positive)
   - CXR shows ? PNA, will add on diff, repeat sputum culture. Will hold
   of on treating empirically for now, but will have low threshold to
   start (any resp distress, desat)
   Shock: Patient with increased lactate this morning to 7; previously in
   4 range. Hypotensive requiring pressors. Considering global
   hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential
   sources. Per renal, very small amount of lactate in CVVG
   - Patient responded well to albumen bolus (lactate 7->4); implying that
   she may be globally hypoperfused. Given this, she got 1 unit PRBCs.
   - If lactate goes up or becomes hypotensive will transfuse 1 unit
   PRBCs. i
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**], considering vasopressin suppression in
   setting of illness, will try trial of vasopressin if requires pressors
   again, and blood pressure does not respond to volume.
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], run even
   - Renal following, appreciate input:
   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
    Altered MS: Continues to have poor mental status. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-NMDAR, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. Hg electrophoresis to r/o sickle cell:
   negative.
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - Heme following, agree with probable DIC, do not disagree with heparin
   tx as options limited.
   - trend DIC labs daily now, cryo for fibrinogen <100, platelets for <50
   if bleeding or <30 overall
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   - Hct low today, lactate is down, so will watch for now.
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient having periods of apnea yesterday, was
   switched to AC
   - tolerating pressure support today, try trach mask if tolerates
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HHV6 infection. It is possible to see this kind of picture with
   something invading her bone marrow, likely something infectious.
   Talking to heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy. Also talking to
   thrombosis specialist about possible etiologies. Would push having
   meeting with several specialist.
   - bone marrow biopsy,
   - HHV6 pending.
   Hypoglycemia: Resolved. Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 8**] have been secondary to FS
   from ischemic finger. Will now check FS from ear or venous.
   - Endocrine consult appreciated: will send plasma insulin, c-peptide,
   proinsulin, sulfonylurea, and BHB if pt becomes hypoglycemic again
    Hyponatremia: Na 135 now and stabilizing.
   - will follow for now
   Transaminitis: LFT
s trending down. AP up, Tbili down.
   - Continue to follow labs

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's condition is deteriorating, with increased lactate levels, hypotension requiring pressors, and evidence of global hypoperfusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Shock: The patient's increased lactate levels and hypotension suggest the possibility of shock. This could be due to global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, or dialysis.

2. Renal failure: The patient is anuric and dialysis-dependent, indicating acute renal failure. The cause of renal failure may be acute tubular necrosis or thrombotic microangiopathy.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has periods of apnea and is currently on pressure support. This suggests the possibility of respiratory failure, possibly due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

4. Thrombotic microangiopathy: The patient has evidence of this condition on the kidneys and skin. It could be caused by an infectious agent such as HHV6 or something invading her bone marrow.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of hypoglycemia, which may be secondary to factitious syndrome from ischemic fingers. Further investigation is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and long hospital course, now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient is on multiple medications and has several medical complications including respiratory failure, renal failure, thrombotic microangiopathy, and hypoglycemia. The patient's mental status is altered, and she requires assistance with breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing periods of apnea and has been switched to assisted ventilation. She tolerates pressure support and is being tried on a tracheostomy mask.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and dialysis-dependent. She has been on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) since August 18th and her renal function is being closely monitored.
3. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient shows evidence of this condition in her kidneys and skin, and it falls into the category of DIC as well. There are case reports of this in bone marrow transplant and CMV viremia with HHV6 infection. The etiology is unclear, but it is possible to see this kind of picture with an infectious invasion of her bone marrow. A bone marrow biopsy"

   check q week viral loads (pending from [**8-30**])
   Shock: Patient with lactate of 5.3 this AM, previous range variable. No
   longer requiring pressors. Considering global hypoperfusion,
   hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential sources of
   increased lactate.
   - Patient responded well to fluid when lactate high.
   - If lactate goes up or becomes hypotensive will give fluid
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**]
   - will try giving FFP for high lactate this morning
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)

   - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HHV6 infection. It is possible to see this kind of picture with
   something invading her bone marrow, likely something infectious.
   Talking to heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy. Also talking to
   thrombosis specialist about possible etiologies. Would push having
   meeting with several specialist.
   - bone marrow biopsy, hematology will get back to us about this.
   - HSV6 negative

   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for comfort, use sparingly
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 122 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 81-85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She has a wandering atrial pacemaker and is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), increased bilirubin levels, and abnormal kidney function. Blood cultures have shown growth of Acinetobacter and yeast, and she has been treated with various antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated.

The patient's imaging shows mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the patient has evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy affecting multiple organs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and NSTEMI. She is currently admitted with a complicated and prolonged hospital course, now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. 

The patient has been febrile, with CMV viremia on gancyclovir and Acinetobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) despite being on ciprofloxacin. She has an increasing white blood cell count and sputum was obtained for organism identification.

The patient's RUQ ultrasound showed a decompressed gallbladder with no evidence of acute cholecystitis, but there is alternating hepatopetal and hepatofugal flow within the portal vein. This finding can be seen in congestive heart failure, other causes of impeded venous return, or pressure changes related to assisted ventilation.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with variable lactates, low mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), and requirement for pressors. She is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has had multiple line replacements.

The patient's mental status has improved slightly, but she still responds intermittently to commands. She is likely experiencing global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential sources of increased lactate.

The patient has evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy involving the kidneys, skin, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There are case reports of this in bone marrow transplant (BMT) and CMV viremia in the setting of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) infection. It is possible to see this kind of picture with an infectious agent invading her bone marrow, and a bone marrow biopsy is being considered.

The patient's respiratory status has been improving, tolerating pressure support, but she was put back on pressure support due to apnea after a fentanyl bolus for pain.

The patient has been on multiple medications, including gancyclovir, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, ceftazidime, heparin, and insulin sliding scale.

1. Multiorgan system failure: The patient is experiencing failure of multiple organs, including respiratory, renal, hepatic, and hematologic systems.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, which can lead to bleeding and thrombotic events.
3. Digital ischemia: The patient has digital ischemia, which can result in limb complications and potential loss.
4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has a C. diff infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has Acinetobacter and Enterobacter VAP, which can worsen respiratory status and increase the risk of mortality.
6. Thrombotic microangiopathy: The patient has evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy involving the kidneys, skin, and DIC.
7. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has had multiple line replacements, increasing the risk of CLABSI.
8. Pressure injuries: The patient's prolonged immobilization and pressure support may increase the risk of developing pressure injuries."

   related to assisted ventilation.
   Microbiology: no new culture data

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   ID: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - RUQ given tibil and AP going up: Negative
   - C difficile:  PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**]),
   adding IV flagyl (day1 [**9-1**])
   - VAP: sputum growing acinetobacter, now intermediate sensitivity to
   cipro. ceftazadine (day 1: [**8-30**]). day [**1-4**]
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q Friday viral loads (pending from [**8-30**])
   Shock: Patient very variable lactates yesterday, peaking at 7.2. [**Month (only) 8**] be
   in the setting of interrupted CVVH yesterday. previous range variable,
   but trending up. No longer requiring pressors. Considering global
   hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential
   sources of increased lactate. Likely has large cardiogenic component
   given severity of MR.
   - Patient responding intermittently to fluid/blood/ffp for increased
   lactate. it may be that lactate level specifically is difficult to
   follow while in intermittent CVVH, the constant production of lactate
   is, of course, concerning.
   - central venous sat, very low yesterday 36 intially and then 17 after
   a unit of blood. later on increased to 25. Likely cardiogenic shock has
   component in this.
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**]
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - plan to give BLOOd if she needs volume given low SVO2
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.  - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will try to take of fluid today given
   hepatic congestion, anasarca, MR, etc.
   - Renal following, appreciate input:
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease. [**8-31**] went up rapidly to the 180s with low
   pressure, but came back up on own. Gave 250cc bolus.
   - no bblocker given hypotension
   - repeat ECHO: no change, unable to asssess pressures.
   - if persists, will cardiovert.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HHV6 infection. It is possible to see this kind of picture with
   something invading her bone marrow, likely something infectious.
   Talking to heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy. Also talking to
   thrombosis specialist about possible etiologies. Would push having
   meeting with several specialist.
   - bone marrow biopsy, hematology will get back to us about this.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] pending
   - plasmapheresis consult will be clarified for clearance of whichever
   antibodies
   - will discontinue plavix forassociation with microangiopathic
   thrombosis
    Altered MS: patients mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerated trach mask for 2 hours [**8-31**],
   but was put back in PS in setting of apnea after fentanyl bolus for
   pain
   - tolerating pressure support today, will try trach mask again today
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - will get RUQ: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and
   vented patients.
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on statin, ASA
   - discontinue plavix as above.
   - no ace or bblcoker given hypotension
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's current condition includes shock with variable lactates, renal failure requiring dialysis, tachycardia of unclear etiology, thrombotic microangiopathy involving kidneys, skin, and DIC, altered mental status likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, resolving DIC with underlying coagulopathy as a possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in the kidney, and limb ischemia. Other conditions include respiratory failure, transaminitis, coronary artery disease, and hyponatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued multiorgan system failure
2. Progression of thrombotic microangiopathy involving other organs
3. Development of additional strokes or worsening of mental status
4. Complications related to ongoing DIC, such as bleeding or clotting disorders

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   Fevers: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - RUQ given tibil and AP going up: Negative
   - C difficile:  PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**]),
   adding IV flagyl (day1 [**9-1**])
   - VAP: sputum growing acinetobacter, now intermediate sensitivity to
   cipro. Started Ceftazadine (day 1: [**8-30**]). day [**3-5**]
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q Friday viral loads (pending from [**8-30**])
   Shock: Patient very variable lactates yesterday, peaking at 7.2. [**Month (only) 8**] be
   in the setting of interrupted CVVH yesterday. No longer requiring
   pressors. Considering global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel
   pathology, and dialysis as potential sources of increased lactate.
   Likely has large cardiogenic component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   - Patient responding intermittently to fluid/blood/ffp for increased
   lactate. it may be that lactate level specifically is difficult to
   follow while in intermittent CVVH,
   - central venous sat, very low yesterday 36 intially and then 17 after
   a unit of blood, later increased to 25. Likely cardiogenic shock
   component
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**]
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Started amio to control rhythm, then started dobutamine to increase
   CO
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.  - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will try to take of fluid today given
   hepatic congestion, anasarca, MR, etc.
   - Renal following, appreciate input:
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease. [**8-31**] went up rapidly to the 180s with low
   pressure, but came back up on own. Gave 250cc bolus.
   - no bblocker given hypotension
   - repeat ECHO: no change, unable to asssess pressures.
   - if persists, will cardiovert.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HHV6 infection. It is possible to see this kind of picture with
   something invading her bone marrow, likely something infectious.
   Talking to heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy. Also talking to
   thrombosis specialist about possible etiologies. Would push having
   meeting with several specialist.
   - bone marrow biopsy, hematology will get back to us about this.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] pending
   - plasmapheresis consult will be clarified for clearance of possible
   antibodies
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
    Altered MS: patients mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerated trach mask for 2 hours [**8-31**],
   but was put back in PS in setting of apnea after fentanyl bolus for
   pain
   - tolerating pressure support today, will try trach mask again today
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients.
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on statin, ASA
   - discontinue plavix as above.
   - no ace or bblcoker given hypotension
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia. The patient also has Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which has been confirmed by culture.

The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ systems. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's central venous oxygen saturation is low, indicating a possible cardiogenic component to her shock. This may require further cardiac support and evaluation.

2. Renal failure: The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and is dependent on dialysis. There are plans to take her off continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and try to manage her fluid balance. Renal function should be closely monitored.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has an unclear etiology for her tachycardia. It is not related to lung disease, but previous echocardiograms have shown high pressures on the right side of the heart. Further evaluation, such as repeat echocardiography or consideration of cardioversion, may be necessary.

4. Thrombotic microangiopathy: The patient shows evidence of thrombotic microangi"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of unknown allergies, transaminitis, and multiple comorbidities. The patient's central oxygen saturation has been consistently low, ranging from 16% to 48%, indicating severe hypoxemia. Despite interventions such as amiodarone for rhythm control and dobutamine to increase cardiac output, the patient's oxygen saturation has fluctuated, with a current level of 100%. The patient is also experiencing cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 23%. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and tachycardia. Fluid balance shows an input of 7,469 mL and an output of 6,503 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 966 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including dobutamine, heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), and amiodarone. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a set FiO2 of 40%. The patient's blood gases reveal a pH of 7.53, PaCO2 of 20 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 438, and a ventilatory exchange ratio of 11.7 L/min. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin"

   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   Fevers: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - RUQ given tibil and AP going up: Negative
   - C difficile:  PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**]),
   adding IV flagyl (day1 [**9-1**])
   - VAP: sputum growing acinetobacter, now intermediate sensitivity to
   cipro. Started Ceftazadine (day 1: [**8-30**]). day [**3-5**]
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q Friday viral loads (pending from [**8-30**])
   Shock: Patient very variable lactates yesterday, peaking at 7.2. [**Month (only) 8**] be
   in the setting of interrupted CVVH yesterday. No longer requiring
   pressors. Considering global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel
   pathology, and dialysis as potential sources of increased lactate.
   Likely has large cardiogenic component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   - Patient responding intermittently to fluid/blood/ffp for increased
   lactate. it may be that lactate level specifically is difficult to
   follow while in intermittent CVVH,
   - central venous sat, very low yesterday 36 intially and then 17 after
   a unit of blood, later increased to 25. Likely cardiogenic shock
   component
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**]
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Started amio to control rhythm, then started dobutamine to increase
   CO
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.  - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will try to take of fluid today given
   hepatic congestion, anasarca, MR, etc.
   - Renal following, appreciate input:
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease. [**8-31**] went up rapidly to the 180s with low
   pressure, but came back up on own. Gave 250cc bolus.
   - no bblocker given hypotension
   - repeat ECHO: no change, unable to asssess pressures.
   - if persists, will cardiovert.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HHV6 infection. It is possible to see this kind of picture with
   something invading her bone marrow, likely something infectious.
   Talking to heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy. Also talking to
   thrombosis specialist about possible etiologies. Would push having
   meeting with several specialist.
   - bone marrow biopsy, hematology will get back to us about this.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] pending
   - plasmapheresis consult will be clarified for clearance of possible
   antibodies
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
    Altered MS: patients mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerated trach mask for 2 hours [**8-31**],
   but was put back in PS in setting of apnea after fentanyl bolus for
   pain
   - tolerating pressure support today, will try trach mask again today
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients.
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on statin, ASA
   - discontinue plavix as above.
   - no ace or bblcoker given hypotension
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and long hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia. She is not suffering from Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient has been febrile and has tested positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia on ganciclovir. She also has Acinetobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after being on ciprofloxacin for 8 days. She has been treated with vancomycin for C. difficile and ceftazidime for VAP. Her central venous oxygen saturation is very low, indicating cardiogenic shock. She is receiving dobutamine to increase cardiac output and amiodarone to control rhythm.

The patient has acute renal failure, anuria, and is dependent on dialysis. She has been on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) since August 18th. Her lactate levels are variable, peaking at 7.2, indicating possible cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion. She is off levophed since August 28th, and the decision has been made not to escalate the pressor beyond the current dose.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   Shock: Patient has had persistently elevated lactates. Considering
   global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as
   potential sources of increased lactate. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on Saturday with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s
   - increase dobutamine from 1.5 to 2 for for cardiogetnic shock.
   - monitor lactate and SV02 q4 hours.
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**], back on [**9-3**].02 for several hours.
   - Per family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond dose at time of
   meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Started amio to control rhythm, prior to starting dobutamine to
   increase CO
   - will start captopril (if tolerates dobutamine increase) for decreased
   afterload in setting of MR.
   Fevers: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from
   [**8-29**]
   - ID recommendations appreciated, reconsulted today for question of CMV
   viremia not improving
   - follow up all cultures
   - RUQ given tibil and AP going up: Negative
   - C difficile:  PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**]),
   adding IV flagyl (day1 [**9-1**])
   - VAP: sputum growing acinetobacter, now intermediate sensitivity to
   cipro. Started Ceftazadine (day 1: [**8-30**]). day [**4-4**]
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q Friday viral loads (pending from [**8-30**]): Viral load from [**8-30**] 2,000,
   down from 2700 the [**8-23**].  Will call ID back to ask if that is
   considered an adequate response, although we suspect she will need the
   [**Doctor Last Name **] changed.
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.  - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]. CVVH now because
   of low  intrathoracic presures
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], held since [**9-2**].
   - will ask renal about ultrafiltrating today to take off fluid, as
   patient is likely on downward end of starling curve, it may help CO.
   - If she does not tolerate HD, which is planned for sometime this week,
   we can try CVVH with different vent setting to fix intrathoracic
   pressures.
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease. [**8-31**] went up rapidly to the 180s with low
   pressure, but came back up on own. Gave 250cc bolus.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow. Talking to
   heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy.
   - bone marrow biopsy, reconsulted hematology regarding this.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
    Altered MS: patients mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis, resending.
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerated trach mask for 2 hours [**8-31**],
   but was put back in PS in setting of apnea after fentanyl bolus for
   pain
   - tolerating pressure support today, will try trach mask again today
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients.
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   Fevers: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from
   [**8-29**]
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - RUQ given tibil and AP going up: Negative
   - C difficile:  PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**]),
   adding IV flagyl (day1 [**9-1**])
   - VAP: sputum growing acinetobacter, now intermediate sensitivity to
   cipro. Started Ceftazadine (day 1: [**8-30**]). day [**4-4**]
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q Friday viral loads (pending from [**8-30**])
   Shock: Patient very variable lactates yesterday, peaking at 7.2. [**Month (only) 8**] be
   in the setting of interrupted CVVH yesterday. No longer requiring
   pressors. Considering global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel
   pathology, and dialysis as potential sources of increased lactate.
   Likely has large cardiogenic component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   - Patient responding intermittently to fluid/blood/ffp for increased
   lactate.
   - central venous sat, very low yesterday 36 intially and then 17 after
   a unit of blood, later increased to 25. Likely cardiogenic shock
   component
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**], back on this AM [**9-2**], 0.02
   - started dobutamine 1.5 for for cardiogetnic shock..
   - Per discussion at family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond
   dose at time of meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Started amio to control rhythm, then started dobutamine to increase
   CO
   - Plan today: check ScVO2 and lactate while on CVVH, hold CVVH and
   recheck (in case blood flow is affecting values); follow lactate q 2-4
   hrs today, titrate dobutamine to lactate
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.  - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], will try to take of fluid today given
   hepatic congestion, anasarca, MR, etc.
   - Renal following, appreciate input:
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease. [**8-31**] went up rapidly to the 180s with low
   pressure, but came back up on own. Gave 250cc bolus.
   - no bblocker given hypotension
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HHV6 infection. It is possible to see this kind of picture with
   something invading her bone marrow, likely something infectious.
   Talking to heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy. Also talking to
   thrombosis specialist about possible etiologies. Would push having
   meeting with several specialist.
   - bone marrow biopsy, hematology will get back to us about this.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] pending
   - plasmapheresis consult will be clarified for clearance of possible
   antibodies
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med
    Altered MS: patients mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerated trach mask for 2 hours [**8-31**],
   but was put back in PS in setting of apnea after fentanyl bolus for
   pain
   - tolerating pressure support today, will try trach mask again today
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients.
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.
   - no ace or bblcoker given hypotension
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now
   Rhabdo: resolved

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has been experiencing fevers, positive CMV viremia, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and has undergone multiple interventions including transfusions, dialysis, and antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is showing signs of cardiogenic shock with variable lactates, low ScVO2, and the need for pressors. There may be a large cardiogenic component due to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and low cardiac output.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with anuria and dialysis dependence. The cause of ARF may be related to sepsis or direct kidney injury.
3. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient exhibits evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy involving the kidneys, skin, and possibly the bone marrow. This could be due to an infectious agent, such as CMV or HHV6, or another cause of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is slightly improved but still altered. It is likely secondary to strokes, toxic-met"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   Shock: Patient has had persistently elevated lactates. Considering
   global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as
   potential sources of increased lactate. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on Saturday with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s
   - increase dobutamine from 1.5 to 2 for for cardiogetnic shock.
   - monitor lactate and SV02 q4 hours.
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**], back on [**9-3**].02 for several hours.
   - Per family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond dose at time of
   meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Started amio to control rhythm, prior to starting dobutamine to
   increase CO
   - will start captopril (if tolerates dobutamine increase) for decreased
   afterload in setting of MR.
   Fevers: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from
   [**8-29**]
   - ID recommendations appreciated, reconsulted today for question of CMV
   viremia not improving
   - follow up all cultures
   - RUQ given tibil and AP going up: Negative
   - C difficile:  PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**]),

Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma and gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient has persistently elevated lactates, indicating possible cardiogenic shock due to the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) and low sublingual venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2).
2. Fevers: The patient is febrile, with recent cultures showing CMV viremia, Acinetobacter baumannii ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Clostridium difficile infection.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, anuria, and is dependent on dialysis. There have been issues with the dialysis catheter, including replacement and low intrathoracic pressures.
4. Tachycardia/MAT: The cause of the patient's tachycardia is unclear, but it may be related to myocarditis or sepsis.
5. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient shows evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy in the kidneys, skin, and DIC. A bone marrow biopsy is planned to investigate further.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   Shock: Patient has had persistently elevated lactates. Considering
   global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as
   potential sources of increased lactate. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on Saturday with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s
   - increase dobutamine from 1.5 to 2 for for cardiogetnic shock.
   - monitor lactate and SV02 q4 hours.
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**], back on [**9-3**].02 for several hours.
   - Per family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond dose at time of
   meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Started amio to control rhythm, prior to starting dobutamine to
   increase CO
   - started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR.
   Fevers: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and not C diff
   Shock: Patient has had persistently elevated lactates. Considering
   global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as
   potential sources of increased lactate. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on Saturday with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s
   - increase dobutamine from 1.5 to 2 for for cardiogetnic shock.
   - monitor lactate and SV02 q4 hours.
   - off levophed since 10pm [**8-28**], back on [**9-3**].02 for several hours.
   - Per family meeting, will not escalate pressor beyond dose at time of
   meeting (ie, levo no greater than 0.06 mg/kg/hr)
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Started amio to control rhythm, prior to starting dobutamine to
   increase CO
   - started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR.
   Fevers: Patient febrile to 102.2 [**8-27**] while off CVVH.  CMV viremia on
   gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of cipro. Now
   C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from
   [**8-29**]
   - ID recommendations appreciated, reconsulted today for question of CMV
   viremia not improving
   - follow up all cultures
   - RUQ given tibil and AP going up: Negative
   - C difficile:  PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**]),
   adding IV flagyl (day1 [**9-1**])
   - VAP: sputum growing acinetobacter, now intermediate sensitivity to
   cipro. Started Ceftazadine (day 1: [**8-30**]). day [**4-4**]
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q Friday viral loads (pending from [**8-30**]): Viral load from [**8-30**] 2,000,
   down from 2700 the [**8-23**].  Will call ID back to ask if that is
   considered an adequate response, although we suspect she will need the
   [**Doctor Last Name **] changed.
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Dialysis cath
   replaced.  - CVVH line repaired [**8-21**], replaced [**8-27**]. CVVH now because
   of low  intrathoracic presures
   - Patient on CVVH since [**8-18**], held since [**9-2**].
   - will ask renal about ultrafiltrating today to take off fluid, as
   patient is likely on downward end of starling curve, it may help CO.
   - If she does not tolerate HD, which is planned for sometime this week,
   we can try CVVH with different vent setting to fix intrathoracic
   pressures.
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease. [**8-31**] went up rapidly to the 180s with low
   pressure, but came back up on own. Gave 250cc bolus.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow. Talking to
   heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy.
   - bone marrow biopsy, reconsulted hematology regarding this.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
    Altered MS: patients mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - will send anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia
   - Continue heparin gtt , goal PTT 50-60, but back on now, will continue
   given limb ischemia
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - ADAMST13: 17 which is low, but can be falsely low in DIC and
   hemolysis, resending.
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerated trach mask for 2 hours [**8-31**],
   but was put back in PS in setting of apnea after fentanyl bolus for
   pain
   - tolerating pressure support today, will try trach mask again today
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients.
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.
   - no bblcoker given hypotension
   - on ACE
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now
   Rhabdo: resolved

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and long hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia. The patient's condition has been further complicated by Clostridium difficile infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and CMV viremia.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including dobutamine, amiodarone, heparin, captopril, gancyclovir, and vancomycin. She has undergone several interventions such as hemodialysis, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), and bone marrow biopsy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a heart rate of 88 bpm, a blood pressure of 93/60 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Her laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion and shock. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and evidence of renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and digital ischemia. She also has Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff).

She is in shock, with persistently elevated lactates, likely due to a combination of global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis. She was started on dobutamine, which improved her condition. The plan is to monitor her lactate and mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2) levels, use vasopressors cautiously, and provide blood transfusions if needed.

She has fevers, with CMV viremia on ganciclovir. She has developed Acinetobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after 8 days of ciprofloxacin. She is now positive for C. difficile and has been treated with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole.

She has renal failure, anuria, and is dependent on dialysis. A temporary HD line was placed, and a dialysis catheter was inserted. She underwent hemodialysis and removed 2kg of fluid.

1. Shock: The patient has persistently elevated lactates, indicating possible shock. The cause of the shock could be due to global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, or dialysis.

2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which could be due to various infections. The note mentions CMV viremia on gancyclovir, Actinobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after being on ciprofloxacin, and C. difficile infection.

3. Tachycardia/MAT: The patient has an unclear etiology of tachycardia. This could be due to several factors, including cardiac issues, sepsis, or other systemic conditions.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which is anuric and dialysis-dependent. This may require further intervention such as hemodialysis.

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, the 24-hour events section provides important information about the patient's health progress. 

The patient has a low level of ADAMTS 13, which can lead to a condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly from 124 to 77 thousand per microliter, and the medical team has stopped heparin due to the possibility of a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient is also experiencing rising liver enzymes (LFTs) since August 30th, and vancomycin, one of the antibiotics given, can cause thrombocytopenia.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including ceftazidime, gancyclovir, metronidazole, and vancomycin. Amiodarone and dobutamine infusions are also being administered. Other ICU medications and medical history are noted.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 93/60 to 109/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 67%. The patient has a wandering atrial pacemaker (WAP) as their heart rhythm. The patient's weight is 97 kg, and their height is 66 inches. Central venous pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Patient has had persistently elevated lactates. Considering
   global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as
   potential sources of increased lactate. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on Saturday with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s.
   - monitor lactate and SV02
   - levophed  off
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Amio to control rhythm
   - had started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR,
   titrating up as BP tolerates, but stopped with new thrombocytopenia
   Fevers: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP
   s/p 8 days of cipro. Now C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**].
   Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - RUQ given tibil and AP going up: Negative
   - C difficile:  PO vancomycin for treatment of c diff (day 1: [**8-28**]),
   adding IV flagyl (day1 [**9-1**])
   - VAP: sputum growing acinetobacter, now intermediate sensitivity to
   cipro. Started Ceftazadine (day 1: [**8-30**]). day [**4-4**]
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: continue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course, check
   q Friday viral loads (pending from [**8-30**]): Viral load from [**8-30**] 2,000,
   down from 2700 the [**8-23**].  Stopped Ganciclovir given PLTs.
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed.
   - HD now, took off 3.8 L yesterday
   - Needs IR removal of tunneled line today (ordered)
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease. [**8-31**] went up rapidly to the 180s with low
   pressure, but came back up on own. Gave 250cc bolus.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow. Talking to
   heme about doing a bone marrow biopsy.
   - bone marrow biopsy, reconsulted hematology regarding this: pending.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
    Altered MS: patients mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly
   improving.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - Held heparin given concern for HIT
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients
   - Take off fluid as tolerated by HD
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco (on)
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.
   - no beta blocker given hypotension
   - on ACE, stopped for PLTs
   Thrombocytopenia: Today PLTs down to 77, have not been this low in a
   while, decreased further to 24. Fibrinogen normal. Hct stable.
   - DIC labs sent, smear w/o schistocytes
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and is now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's current condition includes shock, fevers, renal failure, tachycardia, thrombotic microangiopathy, altered mental status, DIC/anemia, respiratory failure, transaminitis, coronary artery disease, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient has persistently elevated lactates, indicating global hypoperfusion. This could be due to hypovolemia, bowel pathology, or dialysis. Given the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR), there is likely a large cardiogenic component. Dobutamine has been started to improve cardiac output and ScVO2.

2. Fevers: The patient has CMV viremia despite being on ganciclovir. She also has Acinetobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after 8 days of ciprofloxacin. She is now positive for Clostridium difficile infection.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF),"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Patient has had persistently elevated lactates. Considering
   global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as
   potential sources of increased lactate. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on Saturday with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s.
   - monitor lactate and SV02
   - levophed  off > 24h
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Amio to control rhythm
   - had started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR,
   titrating up as BP tolerates, but stopped with new thrombocytopenia
   Fevers: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP
   s/p 8 days of cipro. Now C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**].
   Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - RUQ given tibil and AP going up: Negative
   - C difficile:  Will stop Vanco given PLTs, on Flagyl
   - VAP: sputum growing acinetobacter, now intermediate sensitivity to
   cipro. Started Ceftazadine (day 1: [**8-30**]). day [**7-5**] today
   - completed Cipro 8 day course  ([**Date range (1) 1287**]) for VAP
   - CMV viremia: discontinue Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**8-20**]) 2 week course,
   check q Friday viral loads.
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed.
   - HD now, took off 3.8 L yesterday
   - Needs IR removal of tunneled line (ordered) but given low PLTs
   concern for bleeding if line removed
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease. [**8-31**] went up rapidly to the 180s with low
   pressure, but came back up on own. Gave 250cc bolus.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  pending.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Holding heparin given PLTs
    Altered MS: patient
s mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly
   improving.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
    DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - Held heparin given concern for HIT
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients
   - Take off fluid as tolerated by HD
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.
   - no beta blocker given hypotension
   - on ACE, stopped for PLTs
   Thrombocytopenia: Today PLTs down to 77, have not been this low in a
   while, decreased further to 24. Fibrinogen normal. Hct stable.
   - DIC labs sent, smear w/o schistocytes
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 479] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course and is now experiencing worsening multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient has persistently elevated lactates, suggesting possible cardiogenic shock due to the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) and low sublingual venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2).
2. Fevers: The patient is experiencing fevers, which are likely due to CMV viremia on gancyclovir, Actinobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Clostridium difficile infection.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), anuria, and is dependent on dialysis. The temporary HD line was placed, but needs IR removal of tunneled line due to low platelet count (PLTs).
4. Tachycardia/MAT: The cause of tachycardia is unclear, and there is concern for myocardial ischemia and infarction (MAT).
5. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient has evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) affecting the kidneys, skin, and"

   now will come back up slowly. also possible that she is back in DIC.
   - DIC labs, low hapto and FDP going up
   - smear w/o schistocytes
   - HIT Negative
   - restart heparin gtt
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed.
   - HD now, took off 3.8 L [**9-5**], 5L [**9-6**], will try to ultrafiltrate
   again today.
   - Needs IR removal of tunneled line (ordered) but given low PLTs
   concern for bleeding if line removed
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  pending.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Holding heparin given PLTs
   Altered MS: patient
s mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly
   improving.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - Held heparin given concern for HIT
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients
   - Take off fluid as tolerated by HD
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.
   - no beta blocker given hypotension

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note. However, based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Shock: The patient has persistently elevated lactates, indicating possible global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential sources of increased lactate. The patient was started on dobutamine, which is a medication used to treat low blood pressure and improve blood flow.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding. This may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's platelet count is slowly increasing, but it is still concerning for bleeding.

3. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including CMV viremia, C. difficile infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). These infections may require appropriate antibiotic therapy and treatment.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is anuric and dialysis-dependent. This indicates that the kidneys are not functioning properly, and the patient requires dialysis to remove waste products from the blood.

5. Tachycardia/MAT: The patient has an unclear etiology of tachycardia, which could be due to various"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Patient has had persistently elevated lactates. Considering
   global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as
   potential sources of increased lactate. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on Saturday with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s.
   - monitor lactate and SV02
   - levophed off > 72h
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Amio to control rhythm
   - had started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR,
   titrating up as BP tolerates, but stopped with new thrombocytopenia
   ID: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8
   days of cipro.C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in
   sputum from [**8-29**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - C difficile:  Will stop Vanco given PLTs, on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course

   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads.
    Thrombocytopenia: platelets 24 yesterday, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative. Possible that she has clot somewhere that used platelets, and
   now will come back up slowly. also possible that she is back in DIC.
   - DIC labs, low hapto and FDP going up
   - smear w/o schistocytes
   - HIT Negative
   - restart heparin gtt
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed.
   - HD now, took off 3.8 L [**9-5**], 5L [**9-6**], will try to ultrafiltrate
   again today.
   - Needs IR removal of tunneled line (ordered) but given low PLTs
   concern for bleeding if line removed
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  pending.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Holding heparin given PLTs
   Altered MS: patient
s mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly
   improving.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - Held heparin given concern for HIT
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients
   - Take off fluid as tolerated by HD
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and long hospital course and now presents with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Shock: The patient has persistently elevated lactates, indicating possible shock. She is being treated with dobutamine, which is helping to improve cardiac output and decrease lactate levels.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which could be due to DIC or another cause of thrombocytopenia. This may increase the risk of bleeding, especially considering the planned removal of her tunneled line.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) and is dependent on dialysis. She is currently undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and needs further management of fluid balance and electrolyte disturbances.

4. Tachycardia/MAT: The cause of the patient's tachycardia is unclear. She has evidence of myocardial dysfunction, but no lung disease. She is on amiodarone for rhythm control, and further evaluation is needed.

5. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient has evidence of thrombot"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by long hospitalization, and now presenting with worsening multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Shock: The patient has persistently elevated lactates, indicating global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as potential sources of increased lactate. Given the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) and low sublingual venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2), there is a likelihood of large cardiogenic component. The patient was started on dobutamine on Saturday with decreasing lactates and increasing SVO2. Monitoring lactate and SV02, levophed off >72 hours, planned blood transfusion if needed due to low SVO2, and controlling rhythm with amiodarone are recommended.

2. Infections:
   - CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after 8 days of ciprofloxacin. C. difficile positive from culture on [8-27]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [8-29].
   - ID recommendations appreciated.
   - Follow up all cultures.
   - C. difficile: Stop Vancomycin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfasalazine and unknown allergies. He is currently receiving multiple IV medications, including heparin sodium, dobutamine, amiodarone, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/63 mmHg to 103/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation is 88%, and fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 2,969 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an aerosol-cool tracheostomy mask, and his ABG results are not provided. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and some other parameters. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), lactate, D-dimer, and lactic acid, as well as decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), leukocyte count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and albumin levels. Other lab results show abnormalities in electrolytes, liver enzymes, kidney function, and cardiac markers."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Likely cardiogenic. Patient has had persistently elevated
   lactates that are improving on dobutamine. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on [**9-1**] with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s.
   - monitor lactate and SV02 tid
   - levophed off > 72h
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Amio to control rhythm
   - had started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR,
   titrating up as BP tolerates, but stopped with new thrombocytopenia
   - dobutamine stable at 3.5
   ID: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8
   days of cipro.C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in
   sputum from [**8-29**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - C difficile:  Will stop Vanco given PLTs, on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads.
   - Bone marry biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs afb infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
    Thrombocytopenia: platelets 24 yesterday, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative. Possible that she has clot somewhere that used platelets, and
   now will come back up slowly. also possible that she is back in DIC,
   but no schistocytes.
   - DIC labs, low hapto and FDP going up, but no schistocytes
   - HIT Negative
   - restart heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed.
   - HD now, took off 3.8 L [**9-5**], 5L [**9-6**], will try to ultrafiltrate
   again today.
   - Needs IR removal of tunneled line (ordered) but given low PLTs
   concern for bleeding if line removed
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Holding heparin given PLTs
   Altered MS: patient
s mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly
   improving.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - restart heparin given concern for HIT
   - trend DIC labs daily now,

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock and has been started on dobutamine. She has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 24 K/uL, negative for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and has received blood transfusions. The patient has renal failure requiring dialysis, tachycardia of unclear etiology, severe mitral regurgitation (MR), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) involving kidneys and skin, altered mental status, and evidence of resolving DIC. The patient's medical conditions include coronary artery disease (CAD), NSTEMI, and previous bare metal stent placement to the right coronary artery (RCA). She also has transaminitis, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, and various other complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is already experiencing cardiogenic shock, which can worsen if cardiac function deteriorates further.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Likely cardiogenic. Patient has had persistently elevated
   lactates that are improving on dobutamine. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on [**9-1**] with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s.
   - monitor lactate and SV02 tid
   - levophed off > 72h
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Amio to control rhythm
   - had started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR,
   titrating up as BP tolerates, but stopped with new thrombocytopenia
   - dobutamine stable at 3.5, follow lactates
   ID: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8
   days of cipro.C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in
   sputum from [**8-29**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures

   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads.
   - Bone marry biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs afb infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
    Thrombocytopenia: platelets 24 yesterday, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative. Possible that she has clot somewhere that used platelets, and
   now will come back up slowly. also possible that she is back in DIC,
   but no schistocytes.
   - DIC labs, low hapto and FDP going up, but no schistocytes
   - HIT Negative
   - restart heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed.
   - HD now, took off 3.8 L [**9-5**], 5L [**9-6**], plan for UF on Monday.
   - Needs IR removal of tunneled line (ordered) but given low PLTs
   concern for bleeding if line removed; consider IR replace,ent of
   tunneled line given projected course
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Heparin gtt
   - vascular surgery c/s for possible revision of nonviable digits
   Altered MS: patient
s mental status is improved slightly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly
   improving.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - restart heparin given concern for HIT
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Last Name 479] is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, complicated hospital course, improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia, and now C diff infection. She has a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and a bare metal stent placed to RCA for CAD.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock likely due to severe mitral regurgitation, thrombocytopenia with platelets at 24 (yesterday) coming back up slowly, renal failure requiring dialysis, tachycardia of unclear etiology, thrombotic microangiopathy involving the kidneys, skin, and possibly bone marrow, altered mental status improving slightly, and resolving disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's persistent low blood pressure and elevated lactates indicate cardiogenic shock, which is likely due to severe mitral regurgitation. Dobutamine has been started to improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion. Monitoring lactate and SvO2 levels will be crucial.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk of bleeding. Since the patient has had a negative HIT, heparin can be restarted. However, due to the low platelets, there is a concern for bleeding if the tunneled line is removed. Consideration should be given to replacing"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with worsening multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Patient has had persistently elevated lactates. Considering
   global hypoperfusion, hypovolemia, bowel pathology, and dialysis as
   potential sources of increased lactate. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2.
   Was started on dobutamine on Saturday with decreasing lactates and
   increasing SVO2s. Able to diurese more successfully on Dobutamine
   - monitor lactate and SV02
   - levophed off > 72h
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2
   - Amio to control rhythm
   ID: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8
   days of cipro.C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in
   sputum from [**8-29**].
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - C difficile:  Will stop Vanco given PLTs, on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads.
    Thrombocytopenia: platelets 24 yesterday, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative. Possible that she has clot somewhere that used platelets, and
   now will come back up slowly. also possible that she is back in DIC.
   - DIC labs, low hapto and FDP going up
   - smear w/o schistocytes
   - HIT Negative
   - restart heparin gtt
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed.
   - HD yesterday, took off 3.8 L [**9-5**], 5L [**9-6**], will try to
   ultrafiltrate again today. Potassium climbing, CXR looks more volume
   overloaded. Will need dialysis/ultrafiltration on Monday.
   - Needs IR removal of tunneled line (ordered) but given low PLTs
   concern for bleeding if line removed
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  pending.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Holding heparin given PLTs
   Altered MS: patient
s mental status is improved significantly. She is
   respond both yes and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely
   secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - Held heparin given concern for HIT
   - trend DIC labs daily now,
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask
   Transaminitis: All LFTs trending up again, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients
   - Take off fluid as tolerated by HD
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.
   - no beta blocker given hypotension
   - on ACE - can restart at low dose (6.25 captopril and up titrate to
   decrease dobuta)
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient's current condition includes shock, thrombocytopenia, renal failure requiring dialysis, tachycardia of unclear etiology, thrombotic microangiopathy, altered mental status, DIC/anemia, respiratory failure, transaminitis, and coronary artery disease. 

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of shock, progression of renal failure, development of further thrombotic events, worsening of mental status, progression of respiratory failure, exacerbation of transaminitis, and complications related to coronary artery disease. 

It is important to continue with the current treatment plan, including monitoring of lactate and mixed venous oxygen saturation, weaning off levophed, administration of blood products if needed, control of rhythm with amiodarone, and appropriate management of infections. Additionally, further investigations such as bone marrow biopsy, plasmapheresis, and neurologic evaluations may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted for NSTEMI and complicated hospital course. She has improving multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, CMV viremia, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), thrombocytopenia, renal failure, tachycardia, thrombotic microangiopathy, altered mental status, DIC/anemia, respiratory failure, transaminitis, and coronary artery disease. The patient is on multiple medications including dobutamine, captopril, amiodarone, heparin, flagyl, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has signs of cardiogenic shock, indicated by persistently elevated lactates and low systemic vascular oxygen saturation (ScVO2). This condition requires close monitoring of vital signs and organ perfusion.
2. CMV Viremia: The patient has CMV viremia and is on ganciclovir treatment. Monitoring viral loads and following ID recommendations is essential to prevent further complications.
3. Acinetobacter and Enterobacter VAP: The patient has both Acinetobacter and Enterobacter VAP. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued based on sensitivities,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Likely cardiogenic now. Patient has had persistently elevated
   lactates that are improving on dobutamine. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2. Was started on dobutamine on
   [**9-1**] with decreasing lactates and increasing SVO2s.
   - monitor lactate and SV02 tid
   - levophed off > 72h (with exception of brief period yesterday)
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2 so gave one
   unit pRBCs yesterday
   - Amio to control rhythm
   - had started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR,
   titrating up as BP tolerates, but stopped with new thrombocytopenia,
   restarted yesterday, held again in setting of [**Last Name (LF) 1727**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] try to
   restart later today after HD
   - dobutamine stable at 3.5, follow lactates/ScVO2
   ID: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8
   days of cipro.C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in
   sputum from [**8-29**]. Had been afebrile, now temp curve trending upward;
   all abx had been stopped except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads.
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
    Thrombocytopenia: platelets up to 84 this AM, coming back up slowly.
   HIT negative. Possible that she has clot somewhere that used platelets,
   and now will come back up slowly.
   - HIT Negative
   - restarted heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed.
   - HD now, took off 3.8 L [**9-5**], 5L [**9-6**], plan for UF on Monday.
   - Needs IR removal of tunneled line (ordered) but given low PLTs
   concern for bleeding if line removed; consider IR replacement of
   tunneled line given projected course
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Heparin gtt
   - vascular surgery c/s for possible revision of nonviable digits: no
   evidence of acutely infected digits, will follow, likely will need
   amputations of toes/partial foot in the future, fingers appear viable
   Altered MS: patient
s mental status is improved dramatically over the
   weekend. She is responding to both yes and no questions. Mouthing words
   to nursing. Likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to
   be slowly improving.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - restart heparin given concern for HIT
   - check DIC labs if bleeding
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   - Trial of PMV today
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients
   - Take off fluid as tolerated by HD
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.
   - no beta blocker given hypotension
   - had started ACE, but stopped for thrombocytopenia
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now
   Rhabdo: resolved

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of fever, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has been receiving multiple IV antibiotics, including metronidazole and piperacillin-tazobactam. He is also on antihypertensive medication (captopril), anticoagulant (heparin), antiarrhythmic (amiodarone), and inotropic support (dobutamine).

The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension requiring vasopressor support, and an increased heart rate. He is mechanically ventilated and has a high oxygen saturation. The physical examination reveals dry gangrene of the distal feet bilaterally, improved perfusion of the hands/fingers, and dry mucous membranes.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. Kidney function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels. Liver enzymes are within normal range, but there is a slight increase in total bilirubin. Electrolytes show mild imbalances in sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. Blood cultures were obtained.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and altered mental status suggests a possible septic state. The elevated white blood cell count and increasing temperature further support this possibility."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Likely cardiogenic now. Patient has had persistently elevated
   lactates that are improving on dobutamine. Likely has large cardiogenic
   component given severity of MR, low ScVO2. Was started on dobutamine on
   [**9-1**] with decreasing lactates and increasing SVO2s.
   - monitor lactate and SV02 tid
   - levophed off > 72h (with exception of brief period yesterday)
   - plan to give BLOOD if she needs volume given low SVO2 so gave one
   unit pRBCs yesterday
   - Amio to control rhythm
   - had started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR,
   titrating up as BP tolerates, but stopped with new thrombocytopenia,
   restarted yesterday, held again in setting of hypoTN
   - dobutamine stable at 3.5, follow lactates/ScVO2
   ID: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8
   days of cipro.C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in
   sputum from [**8-29**]. Had been afebrile, now temp curve trending upward;
   all abx had been stopped except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads.
   - Bone marry biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
    Thrombocytopenia: platelets up to 84 this AM, coming back up slowly.
   HIT negative. Possible that she has clot somewhere that used platelets,
   and now will come back up slowly.
   - HIT Negative
   - restarted heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed.
   Needs more permanent access
   - HD now, took off 3.8 L [**9-5**], 5L [**9-6**], plan for UF today
   - Needs IR removal of tunneled line (ordered) now with platelets up
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative
   - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Heparin gtt
   - vascular surgery c/s for possible revision of nonviable digits:
   awaiting recs; family reluctant to agree to amps
   Altered MS: patient
s mental status is improved dramatically over the
   weekend. She is responding to both yes and no questions. Mouthing words
   to nursing. Likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to
   be slowly improving.
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - restart heparin
   - check DIC labs if bleeding
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.
   - no beta blocker given hypotension
   - have re- started ACE
   Hyponatremia: stable, will follow for now

   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given MR, vol overload, and low SvO2,
   lactates. Patient has had persistently elevated lactates that are
   improving on dobutamine. We weaned from 3.5->3.0 on dobuta and lactate
   increased to 2.4. - monitor lactate.
   - levophed off > 72h (with exception of brief period yesterday)
   - Amio to control tachycardia
   - had started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR,
   titrating up as BP tolerates, but stopped with new thrombocytopenia,
   tolerating thus far today
   - dobutamine stable at 3.0, follow lactates/ScVO2
   ID: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8
   days of cipro.C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in
   sputum from [**8-29**]. Had been afebrile, now temp curve trending upward;
   all abx had been stopped except for Po Flagyl for C diff.

   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 479**] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by long hospitalization, multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. She has cardiogenic shock, renal failure requiring dialysis, tachycardia of unclear etiology, thrombotic microangiopathy involving kidneys, skin, and DIC. She also has altered mental status due to possible strokes and toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, resolving DIC, respiratory failure, transaminitis, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen due to the underlying multiorgan system failure and DIC.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may progress, leading to further complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The involvement of multiple organs, including the kidneys and skin, indicates a severe case of thrombotic microangiopathy. This condition can lead to organ damage and failure.
4. DIC: Although the patient's DIC seems to be resolving, the recent drop in platelets suggests a possible relapse or ongoing coagulopathy.
5. Tachycardia: The etiology of the patient's tachycardia remains unclear. It needs"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course, with multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, likely due to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), low mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2), and persistent elevated lactates. She is on dobutamine and levophed, with decreasing lactates and increasing SVO2. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, renal failure requiring dialysis, tachycardia of unclear etiology, thrombotic microangiopathy involving the kidneys, skin, and DIC, altered mental status likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic causes, and resolving DIC with underlying coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy in the kidney, and LE ischemia. Other conditions include respiratory failure, transaminitis, coronary artery disease, hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, and ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's current condition is improving, with cardiogenic shock being managed with dobutamine. The patient's mixed venous saturation and lactate levels are being monitored. The patient also received captopril for afterload reduction but experienced a significant decrease in blood pressure, requiring an increase in dobutamine.

The patient has several medical complications, including:
1. ID (infectious disease): The patient has CMV viremia, which was treated with ganciclovir, and Actinobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which was treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient also has a positive C. difficile culture and is currently being treated with flagyl.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low but is slowly increasing. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is negative, so heparin can be restarted.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, anuria, and is dialysis-dependent. A temporary HD (hemodialysis) line was placed and is working well.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and now C diff infection.
   Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given MR, vol overload, and low SvO2,
   lactates. Patient has had persistently elevated lactates that are
   improving on dobutamine. We weaned from 3.5->3.0 on dobuta and lactate
   increased to 2.4. - monitor lactate.
   - levophed off > 72h (with exception of brief period yesterday)
   - Amio to control tachycardia
   - had started captopril for decreased afterload in setting of MR,
   titrating up as BP tolerates, but stopped with new thrombocytopenia,
   tolerating thus far today
   - dobutamine stable at 3.0, follow lactates/ScVO2
   ID: CMV viremia on gancyclovir. Actinobacter and Enterobacter VAP s/p 8
   days of cipro.C diff positive from culture from [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in
   sputum from [**8-29**]. Had been afebrile, now temp curve trending upward;
   all abx had been stopped except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - follow up all cultures
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
    Thrombocytopenia: platelets up to 84 this AM, coming back up slowly.
   HIT negative. Possible that she has clot somewhere that used platelets,
   and now will come back up slowly.
   - HIT Negative
   - restarted heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed,
   and to be pulled this afternoon.  Continue to seek removal of fluid
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior, unable to asssess
   pressures.
   - On amio gtt for rhythm control, continue for now, will keep IV for
   now because of ? bowel absorption
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - Heparin gtt on (hold peri-line pull)
   - vascular surgery c/s for possible revision of nonviable digits: no
   evidence of acutely infected digits, will follow, likely will need
   amputations of toes/partial foot in the future, fingers appear viable
   Altered MS: patient
s mental status is improved dramatically over the
   weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes and no questions.
   Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to strokes and
   toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, can move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   DIC/Anemia: patient in resolving DIC. Pt may have with underlying
   coagulopathy as possible etiology for initial MI, CVA, microangiopathy
   in kidney, LE ischemia. DIC appeared to have resolved but now PLTs
   dropping.
   - restart heparin given concern for HIT
   - check DIC labs if bleeding
   - transfuse for hct goal >21.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   - Trial of PMV today
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs
   - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can be see in CHF and vented
   patients
   - Take off fluid as tolerated by HD
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - on ASA
   - discontinued plavix as above.
   - no beta blocker given hypotension
   - cont captopril

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing cardiogenic shock, renal failure, thrombotic microangiopathy, altered mental status, respiratory failure, transaminitis, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to her persistently elevated lactate levels and low SvO2. Close monitoring and continued weaning of dobutamine as tolerated are necessary.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) and is anuric, requiring dialysis. The temporary HD line placed and working well should help with fluid removal.

3. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient shows evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy involving the kidneys, skin, and DIC. This could be related to an infectious process invading her bone marrow. Further evaluation and treatment are needed, including plasmapheresis consult and sending ADAMTS13.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving, but she still has difficulty moving her right arm. This could be secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Continued monitoring and neurologic recommendations are"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, and now presenting with improving multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course. 

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR), volume overload, and low mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2). Dobutamine is being weaned as tolerated without significant increase in lactate or decrease in mixed venous sats.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, but it is slowly improving. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is negative.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), anuria, and is dependent on dialysis. A temporary hemodialysis line was placed and is working well.
4. Tachycardia/MAT (myocardial infarction with an abnormal troponin): The etiology of tachycardia is unclear, and there is no evidence of lung disease. A repeat echocardiogram shows severe 4+ MR.
5. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient has evidence of this"

   little change in the appearance of the support monitoring devices.
   Persistent opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis
   and effusion, the supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded. The right
   hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen.  Prominence of interstitial
   markings again suggests elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
   [**9-12**] -
   NG tube tip extends into the stomach, with sidehole in stomach, and tip

   unchanged in position. Cardiomegaly with bibasilar opacities, with
   improvement in pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions persist.

   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever- ID: CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   - Defer abx change for now, f/u sputum micro results. If clinically
   worsens, will treat for pneumonia with vanc/zosyn
   - Attempt to resite lines.
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates. Patient has had persistently elevated lactates
   that are improving on dobutamine. Dobutamine is being weaned as
   tolerated with no significant increase in lactate or decrease in mixed
   venous sats.  Unable to tolerate captopril [**12-29**] hypotension
   - Continue to wean Dobutamine as tolerated but following lactates and
   follow mixed venous saturations
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets are stable, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed
   and working well.  Continue to seek removal of fluid
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.
- The patient's condition has been improving, but she continues to experience various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to 4+ mitral regurgitation, volume overload, and low SvO2. She has persistently elevated lactates that are improving with dobutamine treatment. Dobutamine is being weaned as tolerated.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable platelets, which are slowly increasing. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is negative, and heparin gtt has been restarted.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, anuria, and dialysis dependency. A temporary HD (hemodialysis) line has been placed and is working well.
4. Tachycardia/MAT: The etiology of tachycardia is unclear. No lung disease is present, but there is evidence of increased pressure on previous echocardiogram, indicating severe 4+ MR (mitral regurgitation).

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever- ID: CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   - Defer abx change for now, f/u sputum micro results. If clinically
   worsens, will treat for pneumonia with vanc/zosyn
   - Attempt to resite lines.
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates. Patient has had persistently elevated lactates
   that are improving on dobutamine. Dobutamine is being weaned as
   tolerated with no significant increase in lactate or decrease in mixed
   venous sats.  Unable to tolerate captopril [**12-29**] hypotension
   - Continue to wean Dobutamine as tolerated but following lactates and
   follow mixed venous saturations
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets are stable, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed
   and working well.  Continue to seek removal of fluid
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and long hospital course, presenting with improving multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's fever is attributed to cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, which has been treated with ganciclovir. She also has Actinobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which she has received appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient's platelet count is stable and coming back up slowly, and she has been restarted on heparin. She remains dialysis-dependent with renal failure, and her tachycardia/mixed venous saturation assessment is ongoing. The patient's altered mental status is improving, likely secondary to strokes and toxic-metabolic causes. She continues to have thrombotic microangiopathy involving the kidneys, skin, and DIC. Her altered mental status is improving, but she still has difficulty moving her right arm and left hand. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as indicated by persistent elevated lactates and low SvO2. Dobutamine infusion is being weaned as tolerated.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of unknown allergies, including to Zosyn. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission. Notably, there have been recurrent infections indicated by the presence of Gram-Negative Rods (GNRs) in sputum cultures, despite no growth in blood cultures. Additionally, the patient's central venous catheter and femoral line both failed during attempts to replace them. A urine culture from the Foley catheter revealed yeast growth.

The patient is currently receiving dobutamine at 1.5 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium at 750 units/hour. Other medications include fentanyl and additional heparin doses. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted infections.

Vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F) and a current temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F). Blood pressure is low at 91/54 mmHg, with fluctuations between 80/47 and 103/67 mmHg. Respiratory rate is elevated at 26 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 100% on a T-piece. Heart rhythm is wandering atrial pacemaker (WAP).

Fluid balance indicates a negative balance of 4,076 mL since 12 AM, with total input of 1,124 mL and output of 5,200 mL, including 435 mL of urine output. The patient's weight has increased from 92 kg at admission to 97 kg currently.

Respiratory support includes delivery of oxygen via a T-piece, with ABG results showing pH at 7.48, PaCO2 at 35 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 324.

Physical examination findings include non-assessment of peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic functions due to the patient's inability to be assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 12.2 to 13.4 K/uL. Hemoglobin levels are within normal range at 8.2 g/dL. Blood glucose levels are stable around 117 mg/dL. Creatinine levels are elevated at 1.6 mg/dL. Liver enzymes such as ALT and AST are slightly elevated. Other lab values indicate possible kidney dysfunction, coagulopathy, and elevated markers of cardiac injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis secondary to the recurrent infections, further deterioration in blood pressure leading to shock, potential worsening of kidney function, and ongoing cardiac dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever- ID: CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   - Given fevers
 will attempt to resite lines, and will also re-add PO
   Vanc given hx of Cdiff and diarrhea
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates.
   -  Patient required increase of Dobutamine this morning to 3 while
   receiving HD.  She was also given a fluid bolus
   - Continue to try and wean Dobutamine and follow lactates and mixed
   venous sats
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets are stable, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed
   and working well.  Continue to seek removal of fluid
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.

   note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and add the
   following points:
   44 y/o F w/asthma who presented to OSH [**7-22**] in respiratory distress,
   intubated after arrival. Ruled in by enzymes so transferred here to
   cath lab.  Had 100% distal RCA stenosis s/p BMS x2. subsequently
   developed thrombotic microangiopathy unclear etiology:
   1) Cardiogenic shock:
   Lactate rose with downtitrating of dobutamine so currently back up at
   1.
   Recheck lactate now--it may be elevated from sepsis as well.
   2) Fever:
   Potential sources are pneumonia, wound infection, line infection.
   There is no new infiltrate.
   Will change her central venous line and follow cultures.
   If fevers persist or there is evidence of sepsis, will add empiric abx.
   3) TMA:
   Continue heparin gtt once line is replaced.  Cont ASA, off plavix.
   4) Renal faliure:
   HD today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the hospital in respiratory distress. She was intubated and diagnosed with 100% distal RCA stenosis after experiencing thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) of unclear etiology. The patient is currently in the ICU and being treated for cardiogenic shock, fever, TMA, and renal failure. She has multiple lines, including a central venous line that will be replaced due to potential sources of infection such as pneumonia, wound infection, or line infection. The patient is also on renal nutrition and undergoing dialysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's lactate levels rose when dobutamine was downtitrated, indicating possible worsening of cardiogenic shock. This could be due to sepsis or other factors. Continuous monitoring of lactate levels is necessary to assess the patient's condition.
2. Fever: The patient has had persistent fevers, which may be due to pneumonia, wound infection, or line infection. Changing the central venous line and following cultures are recommended to identify the source of infection. If fevers persist or there is evidence of sepsis, empiric antibiotics may be added.
3. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): The patient has TMA, which requires continued heparin therapy once the central line is replaced. Antiplatelet therapy with ASA should be continued, while P"

   following points:
   44 y/o F w/asthma who presented to OSH [**7-22**] in respiratory distress,
   intubated after arrival. Ruled in by enzymes so transferred here to
   cath lab.  Had 100% distal RCA stenosis s/p BMS x2. subsequently
   developed thrombotic microangiopathy unclear etiology:
   1) Cardiogenic shock:
   Dropped BP during HD as large volume removed.  Required increase in
   dobutamine..
   Recheck lactate now-it may be elevated from sepsis as well.
   D/C Aline , follow non invasive BP given concerns of site infection
   2) Fever:
   Potential sources are pneumonia, wound infection, line infection.
   There is no new infiltrate.
   Will need to change her central venous line and follow cultures.
   Unsuccessfull last night.
   If fevers persist or there is evidence of sepsis, will add empiric abx.
   Will add PO vancomycin for fevers.
   Will continue to trend lactate and SVO2
   3) TMA:
   Continue heparin gtt once line is replaced.  Cont ASA, off plavix.
   4) Renal failure:
   HD today dropped pressures and required bolus 800cc and pressure
   returned.  Would decreased fluid goal negative and or consider CVVH.
   5) Heme: Hct 24.4 would consider transfusing to Hct 30 if SVO2 is down
   or lactate is up and hypotensive.
   6) Access: IR guided line changes.

   developed thrombotic microangiopathy unclear etiology:
   1) Cardiogenic shock:
   Lactate rose with downtitrating of dobutamine so currently back up at

   Recheck lactate now--it may be elevated from sepsis as well.
   2) Fever:
   Potential sources are pneumonia, wound infection, line infection.
   There is no new infiltrate.
   Will need to change her central venous line and follow cultures.
   Unsuccessfull last night.
   If fevers persist or there is evidence of sepsis, will add empiric abx.

   3) TMA:

   4) Renal faliure:
   HD today dropped pressures and required bolus 800cc and pressure
   returned.  Would decreased fluid goal negative and or consider CVVH.
   5) Heme: Hct 24.4 would consider transfusing to Hct 30 if SVO2 is down
   or lactate is up and hypotensive.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a medical history of asthma who presented to the hospital in respiratory distress and was subsequently intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with 100% distal RCA stenosis after having two bare metal stents placed. She developed thrombotic microangiopathy with an unclear etiology and is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock. The patient also has a fever, potential sources of which include pneumonia, wound infection, and line infection. The patient's central venous line needs to be changed, and cultures should be followed. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to several factors. Firstly, there is a concern for sepsis, which may be indicated by an elevated lactate level. Secondly, the patient has renal failure, as evidenced by the drop in dialysis catheter pressure and the need for a bolus of 800cc to restore it. This indicates the possibility of fluid overload and the consideration of continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). 

Thirdly, the patient has a hematocrit level of 24.4, which may require transfusion to maintain a target hematocrit of 30, particularly if there are signs of decreased tissue perfusion (SVO2) or elevated lactate levels. 

Additionally, the patient's access for medication administration is an issue. The insertion of an Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter has been unsuccessful, and there"

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, who presented to the hospital in respiratory distress and was intubated after arrival. She was later ruled in by enzymes and transferred to the cath lab, where she underwent a procedure for 100% distal RCA stenosis using a bare-metal stent (BMS). Subsequently, she developed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) of unclear etiology.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's blood pressure dropped during hemodialysis (HD) as a large volume of fluid was removed. She required an increase in dobutamine to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Fever: The patient has had a persistent fever, which may be due to pneumonia, wound infection, or line infection. There are no new infiltrates on imaging, so changing her central venous line and following cultures is recommended. Empiric antibiotics may be added if fevers persist or there is evidence of sepsis. Vancomycin will be given orally for fevers.

3. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): The patient has TMA, which is likely related to the RCA stent placement. She will continue on heparin drip once her central line is replaced, and she will be continued on aspirin while discontinuing clopidogrel.

4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as evident by"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever/Sepsis- ID: patient with fevers, hypotension and a
   leuckocytosis.  Etiologies include line infection (GPCs in clusters and
   pairs) or urinary, given recent UA.
          Patient has been put empirically on IV Vanc for line
   infection
          Stop IV vanc now and check trough in the am
          Will continue empiric C diff treatment with PO Vanc and
   Flagyl
          Will start Meropenem for UTI and await culture results
          Lines may need to be re-sited if cultures continue to return
   positive
          Initiation of Levophed caused tachycardia, thus will hold
   off for now.
          Continue dobutamine.
   Prior ID issues
   CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   - Given fevers
 will attempt to resite lines, and will also re-add PO
   Vanc given hx of Cdiff and diarrhea
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates.
          Continue to try and wean Dobutamine and follow lactates and
   mixed venous sats
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets are stable, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed
   and working well.  Continue to seek removal of fluid
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and previous admission for NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course characterized by multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient presented with fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis, suggesting sepsis. Empirical treatment for line infection and urinary tract infection (UTI) has been initiated. The patient's condition is improving, but she still requires aggressive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis indicate a possible septic state. Prompt identification and management of the infectious source are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome: The patient's prolonged hospital course and multiorgan system failure suggest a risk for ongoing organ dysfunction. Continuous monitoring and supportive care are necessary.
3. DIC: The patient has evidence of DIC, which can lead to bleeding complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management, including blood product transfusions, may be required.
4. Digital Ischemia: The patient has digital ischemia, which requires careful assessment and management to prevent further complications, such as tissue necrosis or gangrene.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever- ID: CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   - Given fevers
 will attempt to resite lines, and will also re-add PO
   Vanc given hx of Cdiff and diarrhea
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates.
   -  Patient required increase of Dobutamine this morning to 3 while
   receiving HD.  She was also given a fluid bolus
   - Continue to try and wean Dobutamine and follow lactates and mixed
   venous sats
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets are stable, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed
   and working well.  Continue to seek removal of fluid
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI.
- She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course with multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.
- The patient's fever is being investigated for possible causes such as CMV viremia, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and C. difficile infection.
- She is currently on dobutamine for cardiogenic shock, and her condition requires careful monitoring and management.
- The patient also has thrombocytopenia, renal failure requiring dialysis, tachycardia with an unclear etiology, thrombotic microangiopathy, and altered mental status possibly due to strokes or toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
- Other issues include respiratory failure, transaminitis, coronary artery disease (CAD), resolved hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis.
- The patient's care plan involves ongoing monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results. She is receiving nutrition support, antibiotics, and medications to manage her various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued multiorgan system failure: The patient's prolonged hospital course and multiple organ dysfunctions indicate a high risk of further deterioration in organ function.
2. Infection: Despite antibiotic therapy, the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and admitted with NSTEMI. The patient has had a complicated hospital course and now presents with improving multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs (GPCs). These findings suggest a line infection. The patient has been empirically started on intravenous vancomycin for the line infection, which will be stopped now and trough levels will be checked in the morning.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI), for which meropenem has been started. It is recommended to await culture results and potentially re-site lines if cultures continue to be positive.

Additionally, the patient has been experiencing cardiogenic shock, likely due to 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR), volume overload, and low mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), as well as lactate elevation. Dobutamine has been continued, and efforts are being made to wean it off while monitoring lactates and mixed venous saturation.

Thrombocytopenia is present, but platelets are stable and coming back up slowly. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia)"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with their
   note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and add the
   following points:
   44 y/o F w/asthma who presented to OSH [**7-22**] in respiratory distress,
   intubated after arrival. Ruled in by enzymes so transferred here to
   cath lab.  Had 100% distal RCA stenosis s/p BMS x2. subsequently
   developed thrombotic microangiopathy unclear etiology:
   1)  shock/Sepsis:Initially suspected a component of volume from CVVH
   and cardiogenic shock.  However, she has +BC from fem art line,
   elevated lacted, low SVO2 yesterday suspect a component of septic
   shock.  Clinical parameters improved.
    -f/u cx data from urine
   -Will wean dobuatime as tolerated. Runs of MAT with Levophed, will hold
   off on transitioning pressor for now.
   -Continue PO vanc/flagyl for C.diff will treat x 1 week post stopping
   antibiotics
   -Vanc IV f/u trough vanc for gram + Bacteremia serial cx if + will need
   all lines replaced.  Will call IR tomorrow for line changes. Would
   recommend inserting PICC and removing right subclavian CL (culture tip)
   and considering changing dialysis
   -Starting empiric meropenem HD dosing for UTI and [**Location (un) 1921**] based on
   sensitivities.
   2) TMA:
   Continue heparin gtt once line is replaced.  Cont ASA, off plavix.
   3) Renal failure:
   HD today dropped pressures and required bolus 800cc and pressure
   returned.  Would decrease fluid goal negative and or consider CVVH.
   4) Heme: Hct 21.5 would consider transfusing to Hct 30 if SVO2 is down
   or lactate is up and hypotensive.  Transfusion goal Hct < 21 unless SVO
   down.  Platelets dropping suspect related to sepsis but may also be
   related to vancomycin. HIT ab negative.
   5) Access: IR guided line changes to be requested tomorrow AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass, NSTEMI, and suspected TTP with microangiopathy, thrombosis of digits, ADAMTS13 positive, HIT negative. The patient is currently experiencing ARF, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction. She has been treated with IVF, broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, and pressors. The patient has a sputum culture positive for Acinetobacter and blood culture positive for gram-positive cocci from a femoral line. She also has a urinary tract infection, as evidenced by nitrate-positive urine culture and large leukocytes. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Laboratory results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, elevated lactate levels, and elevated D-dimer. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she requires continuous monitoring and aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's clinical parameters indicate a possible component of septic shock, given the elevated lactate levels, low mixed venous oxygen saturation, and positive blood cultures. Prompt management is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA): The patient's history of suspected TTP and the current presentation suggest ongoing TMA. Continued heparin therapy once the femoral line is replaced"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with their
   note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and add the
   following points:
   44 y/o F w/asthma who presented to OSH [**7-22**] in respiratory distress,
   intubated after arrival. Ruled in by enzymes so transferred here to
   cath lab.  Had 100% distal RCA stenosis s/p BMS x2. subsequently
   developed thrombotic microangiopathy unclear etiology:
   1) Cardiogenic shock:
   Dropped BP during HD as large volume removed.  Required increase in
   dobutamine..
   Recheck lactate now-it may be elevated from sepsis as well.
   D/C Aline , follow non invasive BP given concerns of site infection
   2) Fever:
   Potential sources are pneumonia, wound infection, line infection.
   There is no new infiltrate.
   Will need to change her central venous line and follow cultures.
   Unsuccessfull last night.
   If fevers persist or there is evidence of sepsis, will add empiric abx.
   Will add PO vancomycin for fevers.
   Will continue to trend lactate and SVO2
   3) TMA:
   Continue heparin gtt once line is replaced.  Cont ASA, off plavix.
   4) Renal failure:
   HD today dropped pressures and required bolus 800cc and pressure
   returned.  Would decreased fluid goal negative and or consider CVVH.
   5) Heme: Hct 24.4 would consider transfusing to Hct 30 if SVO2 is down
   or lactate is up and hypotensive.
   6) Access: IR guided line changes.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress and was intubated. She was diagnosed with 100% distal RCA stenosis and underwent stenting with bare metal stents. Subsequently, she developed thrombotic microangiopathy of unclear etiology.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, fever, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), renal failure, and anemia. She is experiencing low blood pressure during hemodialysis, requiring an increase in dobutamine. Her fever may be due to potential sources such as pneumonia, wound infection, or line infection. She has an unsuccessful attempt to change her central venous line and is showing signs of sepsis.

The patient's TMA will be treated with heparin gtt once the central line is replaced, and she will continue with ASA and discontinue Plavix. Her renal failure will be managed with hemodialysis, potentially reducing fluid goals or considering continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Anemia management includes considering a transfusion to Hct 30 if SVO2 is down or lactate is up and hypotensive.

In terms of access, the patient has an IR-guided line change. Nutrition will be provided through Nutren Renal (Full) at 30 mL/hour. Glycemic control will be monitored. The patient's code status is full code"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress. She was intubated and transferred to the cath lab due to 100% distal RCA stenosis after undergoing two previous stents. The patient subsequently developed thrombotic microangiopathy with an unclear etiology. 

24-hour events include the initiation of dobutamine and the administration of 1 liter of normal saline. Vancomycin and IV antibiotics were added for concern of line infection. The patient tested positive for Acinetobacter in her sputum and gram-positive cocci in her blood culture. A unit of blood was given as her Hct level is 21. 

The patient's urine culture was taken on [**2193-9-14**] at 10:46 AM, and blood culture was taken on [**2193-9-14**] at 11:00 AM from the HD line. The arterial line was stopped on [**2193-9-15**] at 12:12 AM. The patient had a fever of 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Allergies include sulfasalazine, an unknown allergy to Zosyn, and transaminitis. The last doses of antibiotics, vancomycin and metronidazole, were given on [**2193-9-15**] at 07:44 AM. The patient is currently receiving he"

   cath lab.  Had 100% distal RCA stenosis s/p BMS x2. subsequently
   developed thrombotic microangiopathy unclear etiology:
   1) Cardiogenic shock:
   Dropped BP during HD as large volume removed.  Required increase in
   dobutamine..
   Recheck lactate now-it may be elevated from sepsis as well.
   D/C Aline , follow non invasive BP given concerns of site infection
   2) Fever:
   Potential sources are pneumonia, wound infection, line infection.
   There is no new infiltrate.
   Will need to change her central venous line and follow cultures.
   Unsuccessfull last night.
   If fevers persist or there is evidence of sepsis, will add empiric abx.
   Will add PO vancomycin for fevers.
   Will continue to trend lactate and SVO2
   3) TMA:
   Continue heparin gtt once line is replaced.  Cont ASA, off plavix.
   4) Renal failure:
   HD today dropped pressures and required bolus 800cc and pressure
   returned.  Would decreased fluid goal negative and or consider CVVH.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress and was intubated. She was diagnosed with 100% distal RCA stenosis after being treated with two bare-metal stents (BMS). The patient subsequently developed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with an unclear etiology. 

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, fever, TMA, renal failure, and heme issues. The cardiogenic shock occurred during hemodialysis when the patient's blood pressure dropped significantly, requiring an increase in dobutamine. The fever could be due to pneumonia, wound infection, or line infection. The central venous line needs to be changed and cultures followed. If the patient's fevers persist or there is evidence of sepsis, empiric antibiotics may be added, including oral vancomycin. The patient's lactate and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2) should be closely monitored. 

The TMA will continue with heparin infusion once the central line is replaced, and the patient should remain on aspirin while discontinuing clopidogrel. The patient's renal failure during hemodialysis required a bolus of 800cc to restore pressure, and the fluid goal should be decreased or consider continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479], a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, was admitted with NSTEMI and has had a complicated and long hospital course. The patient is now experiencing improving multiorgan system failure with DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) and digital ischemia, as well as C. difficile infection.

The patient presented with fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis, indicating possible sepsis. Empirical treatment was initiated with IV Vancomycin for line infection and oral Vancomycin and Flagyl for C. difficile. The Foley catheter will be removed, and surveillance cultures will be followed. If the cultures continue to show positive results, the lines may need to be re-sited.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia, renal failure, cardiogenic shock, thrombotic microangiopathy, altered mental status/CNS infarcts, respiratory failure, transaminitis, and a history of coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggests sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial to manage this condition.

2. DIC: The patient has evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, which can lead to bleeding and clotting complications. Monitoring coagulation parameters and providing appropriate"

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by long hospital course, multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. She is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been febrile and hypotensive with leukocytosis, indicating sepsis. Empirical treatment for line infection with IV Vancomycin has been started, but the dose was held due to elevated trough levels. PO Vancomycin and Flagyl are being continued for C. difficile infection. Meropenem has been initiated for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and cultures are awaited.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggest ongoing infection and sepsis. Continuous monitoring and prompt management are necessary.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased and then rebounded. Possible causes include sepsis, vancomycin use, or other factors. Monitoring platelet levels and considering alternative antibiotics may be required.

3. Renal failure: The patient is anuric and dialysis-dependent with increased creatinine levels. This indicates acute renal failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal function is essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever/Sepsis- ID: patient with fevers, hypotension and a
   leuckocytosis.  Etiologies include line infection (GPCs in clusters and
   pairs) or urinary, given recent UA.
          Patient has been put empirically on IV Vanc for line
   infection, trough elevated this morning, thus will hold dosees for
   today.
          Continue empiric C diff treatment with PO Vanc and Flagyl
          Will start Meropenem for UTI and await culture results
          CBC trending down today on broad spectrum abx
          Follow surveillance cultures & lines may need to be re-sited
   if cultures continue to return positive
          Initiation of Levophed caused tachycardia, thus will hold
   off for now.
          Continue dobutamine and attempt to wean by following
   lactates and mixed venous sat
          Cr slightly increased today.  Will attempt to run euvolemic
   if still showing signs of sepeis
   Prior ID issues
   CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates.
          Patient had trial of dobutamine wean and initiation of
   levophed for presumed sepsis, but she became tachycadic and was placed
   back on dobutamine.
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets decreased yesterday and have rebounded this
   morning.  Possible etiologies include sepsis, vancomycin.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent with increase in Cr
   today suggestive of decreased intravascular volume.
   - Will talk to renal regarding fluid balance for today
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and NSTEMI. She has been admitted with multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. She presented with fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis, indicating sepsis. Empirical treatment for line infection and urinary tract infection (UTI) has been initiated. The patient's condition is improving, but she continues to face various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggests sepsis. The source of infection could be line-related or urinary tract infection.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count decreased yesterday but rebounded today. Possible etiologies include sepsis or vancomycin use.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is dialysis-dependent with an increase in creatinine today, indicating decreased intravascular volume.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient likely has cardiogenic shock due to 4+ mitral regurgitation, volume overload, and low mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), lactates.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever/Sepsis- ID: patient with fevers, hypotension and a
   leuckocytosis.  Etiologies include line infection (GPCs in clusters and
   pairs) or urinary, given recent UA.
          Patient has been put empirically on IV Vanc for line
   infection
          Stop IV vanc now and check trough in the am
          Will continue empiric C diff treatment with PO Vanc and
   Flagyl
          Will start Meropenem for UTI and await culture results
          Lines may need to be re-sited if cultures continue to return
   positive
          Initiation of Levophed caused tachycardia, thus will hold
   off for now.
          Continue dobutamine.
   Prior ID issues
   CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   - Given fevers
 will attempt to resite lines, and will also re-add PO
   Vanc given hx of Cdiff and diarrhea
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates.
          Continue to try and wean Dobutamine and follow lactates and
   mixed venous sats
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets are stable, coming back up slowly. HIT
   negative.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent.  Temp HD line placed
   and working well.  Continue to seek removal of fluid
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.
    Hyponatremia: Resolved
    Rhabdo: Resolved

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 479] is a 44-year-old female admitted with NSTEMI, complicated by a long hospital course. She is now experiencing improving multiorgan system failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has had various medical issues during her stay, including fevers, sepsis, line infection, urinary tract infection, CMV viremia, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and C. difficile infection. She also has cardiogenic shock, thrombocytopenia, renal failure requiring dialysis, tachycardia, thrombotic microangiopathy, altered mental status/CNS infarcts, respiratory failure, transaminitis, and a history of coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers and leukocytosis, suggesting a possible line infection. Empirical treatment with IV vancomycin has been initiated, but it needs to be confirmed whether the source of infection is indeed the line or urinary tract infection.

2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has positive urine culture results, indicating a UTI. Meropenem has been started for this infection, and cultures are being awaited.

3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has tested positive for C. difficile infection, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. He has been diagnosed with septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple interventions including vasopressors, antibiotics, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggests sepsis. This condition can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome: The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in liver function (elevated transaminase levels), kidney function (elevated creatinine levels), and coagulation (elevated PT/INR and D-dimer levels). These findings suggest dysfunction of multiple organs, which can be a complication of sepsis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate a possible acute kidney injury. This condition can be caused by sepsis-induced renal dysfunction or complications from the use of vasopressors.
4. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient's development of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB w/ RVR) after transitioning from dobutamine to levophed suggests the possibility"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever/Sepsis- ID: patient with fevers, hypotension and a
   leuckocytosis.  Etiologies include line infection (GPCs in clusters and
   pairs) or urinary, given recent UA.
          Patient has been put empirically on IV Vanc for line
   infection, trough elevated this morning, thus will hold doses for today
   and check trough in am
          Continue empiric C diff treatment with PO Vanc and Flagyl
          DC Meropenem given that UCx grew out yeast
          Will DC Foley
          CBC trending down today on broad spectrum abx
          Follow surveillance cultures & lines may need to be re-sited
   if cultures continue to return positive
          Initiation of Levophed caused tachycardia, thus will hold
   off for now.
          Continue dobutamine and attempt to wean by following
   lactates and mixed venous sat
          Cr slightly increased today.  Will attempt to run euvolemic
   if still showing signs of sepeis
   Prior ID issues
   CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates.
          Patient had trial of dobutamine wean and initiation of
   levophed for presumed sepsis, but she became tachycadic and was placed
   back on dobutamine.
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets decreased yesterday and have rebounded this
   morning.  Possible etiologies include sepsis, vancomycin.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent with increase in Cr
   today suggestive of decreased intravascular volume.
   - Will talk to renal regarding fluid balance for today
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and long hospital course, now with improving multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient presented with fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis, suggesting sepsis. Empirical treatment for line infection with IV Vancomycin was initiated, but the patient's trough levels were elevated, so the doses were held and will be checked tomorrow. The patient is also being treated for C. difficile infection with oral Vancomycin and Flagyl.

Her platelets have been decreasing, which could be due to sepsis or Vancomycin. The patient is being followed closely with surveillance cultures and may need to have her lines re-sited if the cultures continue to return positive. Dobutamine and an attempt to wean by following lactates and mixed venous saturation are ongoing. The patient's creatinine level is slightly increased, and euvolemic dialysis is being considered if signs of sepsis persist.

The patient has a history of CMV viremia, Acinetobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and C. difficile infection. Follow-up cultures for urine, blood, and sputum are planned. The patient is also being evaluated for possible"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP: 88/57 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR: 101 bpm), indicating possible septic shock. The low SpO2 level of 84% suggests inadequate oxygenation, which may be related to the patient's respiratory support through a tracheal mask. The presence of multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) in the heart rhythm further supports the possibility of systemic infection or sepsis.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a rising WBC count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium suggest potential kidney dysfunction. Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia with a low platelet count.

The patient's medical history is significant for an unknown allergy to sulfasalazine and previous antibiotic use, including meropenem, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The recent discontinuation of meropenem due to the growth of yeast in the urine indicates a potential fungal infection.

The patient's ongoing treatment includes the infusion of dobutamine to support cardiac function and heparin sodium to prevent clotting. Other medications include fentanyl for pain management and nutritional support with Renal (Full) formula.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever/Sepsis- ID: patient with fevers, hypotension and a
   leuckocytosis.  Etiologies include line infection (GPCs in clusters and
   pairs) or urinary, given recent UA.
          Patient has been put empirically on IV Vanc for line
   infection, trough elevated this morning, thus will hold doses for today
   and check trough in am
          Continue empiric C diff treatment with PO Vanc and Flagyl
          Follow surveillance cultures & lines may need to be re-sited
   if cultures continue to return positive
          Initiation of Levophed caused tachycardia, thus will hold
   off for now.
          Continue dobutamine and attempt to wean by following
   lactates and mixed venous sat
          Cr better today. Give back volume via HD/boluses as needed
   Prior ID issues
   CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates.
          Patient had trial of dobutamine wean and initiation of
   levophed for presumed sepsis, but she became tachycadic and was placed
   back on dobutamine.
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets decreased yesterday and have rebounded this
   morning.  Possible etiologies include sepsis, vancomycin.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent with increase in Cr
   today suggestive of decreased intravascular volume.
   - Will talk to renal regarding fluid balance for today
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and long hospital course with improving multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient presents with fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, and positive cultures for Gram-positive cocci in clusters and pairs. She was empirically started on intravenous vancomycin for line infection, but the dose was held due to elevated trough levels. She continues to receive oral vancomycin and Flagyl for C. difficile infection.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including CMV viremia treated with ganciclovir, Actinobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treated with ciprofloxacin, and Acinetobacter infection in sputum. All antibiotics have been stopped except for oral Flagyl for C. difficile.

Other issues include cardiogenic shock with low SvO2, thrombocytopenia, renal failure requiring dialysis, tachycardia of unclear etiology, thrombotic microangiopathy, altered mental status with possible CNS infarcts, respiratory failure, transaminitis, and a history of coronary artery disease with previous NSTEMI and bare metal stent placement in the right"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   44 y/o F w/asthma who presented to OSH [**7-22**] in respiratory distress,
   intubated after arrival. Ruled in by enzymes so transferred here to
   cath lab.  Had 100% distal RCA stenosis s/p BMS x2. subsequently
   developed thrombotic microangiopathy unclear etiology.
    shock/Sepsis:
   - Fevers (though afeb x 24hrs now), leukocytosis, HOTN, continued
   pressor requirement
   - Empirically on IV vanc for ? line infxn, dose by trough
   - Serial surveillance bcx
   - Empiric c. dif rx PO vanc & flagyl
   - Wean dobutamine as tolerated
   - Sig cardiac component given 4+MR [**First Name (Titles) 1988**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1989**] hemodyn status
   ? Cardiogenic shock
   -          4+MR
   -          -EF 45% - sig portion EF lost to backward flow
   -          Volume overload
   -          Low SvO2, inc lactate
   -          Remove volume as able
   -          Cont manage sepsis
   -          Hopefully as other factors managed, MR impact will decrease
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy
   -          unclear etiology
   -          Significantly improved though some markers c/w slow, ongoing
   process
   -          Heme following.  Appreciate their thoughts & input
   Dry Gangrene:
   - Continue heparin gtt once line is replaced.  Cont ASA, off plavix.
   - Vascular following
   - LE well demarcated

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the hospital in respiratory distress and was intubated. She was diagnosed with 100% distal RCA stenosis after having two previous stents placed. The patient subsequently developed thrombotic microangiopathy of unclear etiology. She is currently experiencing shock/sepsis, cardiogenic shock, thrombotic microangiopathy, dry gangrene, thrombocytopenia, tachycardia, renal failure, pain, and mental status changes.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 80/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheal mask. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is between 56-71%. The patient has received multiple transfusions and has a positive balance of 791 mL of fluids.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. The creatinine level is elevated at 1.9 mg/dL, and the blood glucose level is within normal range. The D-dimer level is significantly elevated at 6402 ng/mL, indicating a possible thrombotic event. The platelet count is low at 83 K/uL.

The patient's plan includes continuing empiric antibiotics for suspected line infection, weaning off dobut"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   44 y/o F w/asthma who presented to OSH [**7-22**] in respiratory distress,
   intubated after arrival. Ruled in by enzymes so transferred here to
   cath lab.  Had 100% distal RCA stenosis s/p BMS x2. subsequently
   developed thrombotic microangiopathy unclear etiology.
    shock/Sepsis:
   -Improving trend though still w/ fever and requiring dobutamine
   -Continue PO vanc/flagyl for C.diff will treat x 1 week post stopping
   antibiotics
   - Vanc IV f/u trough vanc for gram + Bacteremia
   - Serial surveillance bcx
   Dry Gangrene:
   - Continue heparin gtt once line is replaced.  Cont ASA, off plavix.
   - Vascular following
   - LE well demarcated
 plan for amputation once med stabilized.
   Renal failure:
   - cont dialysis
   - renal feels return of renal fxn unlikely
   Pain control
   - fentanyl patch started yesterday
   CHF
   - 4+MR
   - EF 45% - sig portion lost to backward flow

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress and was subsequently intubated. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, shock, dry gangrene, renal failure, pain control, congestive heart failure (CHF), and critical care needs.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Shock: The patient is still requiring dobutamine to support blood pressure, indicating ongoing shock. If not addressed, it can lead to further organ perfusion issues.
3. Dry gangrene: The patient has dry gangrene in the lower extremities. If not promptly treated, this can progress to tissue necrosis and potential limb amputation.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a low likelihood of returning to normal renal function. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
5. CHF: The patient has CHF with significant mitral regurgitation and a reduced ejection fraction. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening cardiac function.
6. Critical care needs: The patient requires ongoing intensive care support, including monitoring, mechanical ventilation, and hemodynamic monitoring. Failure to provide appropriate critical care may result"

   fungal vs AFB infection. Will fu stains and cultures from bm
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates.
          Patient had trial of dobutamine wean and initiation of
   levophed for presumed sepsis, but she became tachycadic and was placed
   back on dobutamine.
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets decreased yesterday and have rebounded this
   morning.  Possible etiologies include sepsis, vancomycin.
   - HIT Negative
   - re-started heparin gtt
   - appreciate hematology recs
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent with increase in Cr
   today suggestive of decreased intravascular volume.
   - Will talk to renal regarding fluid balance for today
   Remainder of plan unchanged from prior:
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - will continue heparin gtt for now (hold for line changes)
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
    Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status is improved
   dramatically over the weekend. She is continuing to respond to both yes
   and no questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to
   strokes and toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hand
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   - appreciate neuro recommendations.
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
   Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
   CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin today- discontinued plavix as above.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is currently experiencing multiorgan system failure. This condition may lead to cardiogenic shock due to cardiac dysfunction.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased, which may be caused by sepsis or vancomycin treatment. This condition can increase the risk of bleeding.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and dialysis dependent, indicating acute renal failure. This can lead to further complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

4. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient has evidence of this condition on the kidneys, skin, and DIC. It is unclear at this time, but possible etiologies include infectious processes or bone marrow necrosis.

5. Altered Mental Status/CNS Infarcts: The patient's mental status has improved but still shows signs of altered mental status and possible strokes.

6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tolerating tracheal mask ventilation, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition worsens.

7. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are stable, but there is a possibility of hepatic congestion contributing to transaminitis.

8. Central Venous Catheter Infection: The patient has been on multiple IV lines and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and long hospital course with multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), volume overload, and low systemic vascular oxygen saturation (SvO2). Dobutamine has been started to support cardiac output, and an echocardiogram will be repeated to reassess MR. The patient may be a candidate for valvular repair.

2. Fever: The patient has been experiencing fever, and C. difficile infection has been confirmed. Antibiotic treatment for C. difficile will continue for two weeks after the last dose of antibiotics. No evidence of ongoing infection has been found, and vancomycin has been discontinued.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is anuric and requires dialysis. Hemodialysis (HD) will be continued three times a week. 

4. Tachycardia/Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT): The etiology of tachycardia is unclear. The patient has severe MR on previous echocardiogram,"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 479**] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated hospital course, including multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection. Currently, she is showing signs of improvement but still faces several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Sepsis: The patient is experiencing fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis, indicating a potential septic condition. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin has been initiated for a suspected line infection. Surveillance cultures and possible re-siting of lines if cultures continue to return positive are recommended.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's condition suggests cardiogenic shock due to severe mitral regurgitation (MR), volume overload, and low SvO2. Dobutamine therapy should be continued to support cardiac function.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count decreased yesterday but rebounded today. Possible causes include sepsis and vancomycin toxicity. Hematology recommendations should be appreciated, and HIT status should be monitored.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), requiring dialysis. Anuria and increased creatinine levels indicate decreased intravascular volume. Hemodialysis sessions on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course, now presenting with improving multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock due to the presence of a 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR), volume overload, and low systemic vascular oxygen saturation (SvO2). Dobutamine has been weaned off, and lactates are stable. An echocardiogram (ECHO) showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%, dilated right atrium (RA), symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), grade III LV dysfunction, 4+ MR, and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation (TR).
2. Fever: The patient has ongoing fevers, despite no evidence of infection. C. diff treatment will continue for an additional two weeks after the last antibiotic exposure. All other antibiotics have been discontinued, except for oral Flagyl for C. diff. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures should be followed up, and a chest X-ray should be performed for an infiltrate given the growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-negative bacilli (GNB).
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), requiring dialysis due to anuria. Hemodialysis (HD) will continue on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The increase in creatinine suggests decreased intravascular volume.
4. Tachycardia/Multisystem Activated Trauma (MAT): The etiology of the tachycardia is unclear. High pressures on previous ECHO and normal chest X-rays indicate the absence of diffuse parenchymal disease. A repeat ECHO showed severe 4+ MR, similar to the previous findings.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count decreased yesterday but rebounded this morning. Possible causes include sepsis and vancomycin. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is negative. Hematology recommendations are appreciated, and tests for GCPD/anti-platelet antibodies are pending.
6. Thrombotic Microangiopathy: The patient exhibits evidence of this condition in the kidneys, skin, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A bone marrow biopsy showed necrosis, which can be seen in infections. HSV6 is negative, and anti-Yo and anti-Doctor Last Name antibodies are also negative. Plasmapheresis consultation and ADAMTS13 resend have been requested.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever- ID:  Patient febrile this morning and pancultured.
   - Will follow fever curve and hold on abx at this point.  If she spikes
   again will empirically add abx
   - RIJ may be source and will be removed
   - Continue c.diff treatment. Course to continue 2weeks after last
   antibiotic
   - No e/o ongoing infection; discontinued vanc. Follow for fevers
   Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume overload,
   and low SvO2, lactates.
   - Weaned off dobutamine and lactates stable
   - Aim to wean off  dobutamine today as trial, follow lactate and sv02
   - ECHO on [**2193-9-19**] w/ EF 45%, dilated RA, symmetric LVH, Grade III LV
   dysfunction, 4+MR, 2+ TR (increased from prior)
   Trach: patient apparently not able to speak with balloon deflated and
   rush of air heard with valve removed.  She has an 8.0 trach placed on
   [**2193-8-7**].
   - Will call thoracics to eval for trach downsizing
   Prior ID issues
   CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will f/u stains and cultures from bm
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent with increase in Cr
   today suggestive of decreased intravascular volume. HD M,W,F. unable to
   reach fluid goal on [**9-18**] secondary to tachycardia and hypotension
   - Plan to continue HD for now
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets decreased yesterday and have rebounded this
   morning.  Possible etiologies include sepsis, vancomycin.
   - HIT Negative
   - appreciate hematology recs
   GCPD/Antiplt Ab pending
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - heparin gtt discontinued [**9-18**]
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
   Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status has improved
   dramatically. She is continuing to respond to both yes and no
   questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to strokes and
   toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hande but this
   has plateaued
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
    Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
    CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin - discontinued plavix as above.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fever and has positive cultures for C. difficile, Acinetobacter, and other bacteria. There is also mention of CMV viremia and a history of previous infections such as actinobacter and Enterobacter ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). These infections may require further treatment and management.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, as indicated by the presence of a dilated right atrium, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and severe mitral regurgitation on echocardiography. This condition can be life-threatening and may require aggressive management with medications and possibly mechanical support.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a decreased platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Possible causes include sepsis, vancomycin use, or other underlying conditions. Monitoring and management of the platelet count is essential.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is dialysis-dependent and has an increase in creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. Appropriate management with hemodialysis and careful fluid balance is necessary.

5. Tachycardia: The patient has an unclear etiology of tachycardia, which may be related to cardiogenic shock, sepsis, or other factors. Close monitoring and evaluation are"

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has evidence of cardiogenic shock due to 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR), volume overload, and low SvO2. Cardiology recommendations suggest intraoperative monitoring with a swan-ganz catheter and consideration of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Close cardiac monitoring and appropriate interventions are crucial.

3. Thrombotic microangiopathy: The patient shows evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy involving the kidneys, skin, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Etiology is unclear, but possible causes include infection invading the bone marrow or a hypercoagulable state. Further evaluation and management are required to address this condition.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with anuria and dependence on dialysis. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes is essential to manage renal function effectively.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course, including multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient is febrile this morning, and a culture was taken. It is important to monitor her fever curve and hold on antibiotics at this point. If she spikes again, antibiotics will be added empirically. The right internal jugular (RIJ) may be a source of infection and may need to be removed.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to fluid shifts in the setting of dialysis. She was repleted with 2.5 liters and started on levophed, which she responded to appropriately. This does not appear to be due to an infectious cause.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock given her 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR), volume overload, and low systemic vascular oxygen saturation (SvO2). Cardiology recommends that she can do well with either dobutamine or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) during surgery.

4. Tracheostomy: The patient's tracheost"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated hospital course with multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently febrile, likely cardiogenic shock, and has been weaned off dobutamine. She also has an increased risk for thrombotic microangiopathy, altered mental status, respiratory failure, transaminitis, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and evidence of volume overload suggest possible cardiogenic shock, which requires close monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support.
3. Thrombotic microangiopathy: The presence of DIC, renal failure, and skin changes raises the concern for thrombotic microangiopathy, a condition that involves small blood clots forming in the microcirculation.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient has a confirmed case of C. difficile infection, which should be treated appropriately to prevent complications such as pseudomembranous colitis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's reliance on a tracheostomy and need for assisted ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure, which requires"

   - No e/o ongoing infection;
   - Patient currently on no antibiotics
   Hypotension/tachycardia: Likely due to fluid shifts in the setting of

   which she responded appropriately.  This didn
t appear to be due to an
   infectious cause.
   - Will discuss with renal CVVH vs HD in this patient
   ?Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume
   overload, and low SvO2, lactates.
   - Patient seen by cardiology and it was suggested that she would
   benefit from intraoperative monitoring, i.e. swan-ganz catheter.  An

   GCPD/Antiplt Ab pending
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no

Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, admitted with NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course, now presenting with improving multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's fever this morning led to panculturing. No ongoing infection was noted, and antibiotics were withheld at this point. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to fluid shifts following dialysis. She was repleted with 2.5 liters of fluid and started on levophed, which she responded to appropriately. This does not appear to be an infectious cause.

The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock given her 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR), volume overload, and low SvO2. Cardiology suggested intraoperative monitoring with a swan-ganz catheter and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). She was weaned off dobutamine, and her lactates remained stable.

The patient's tracheostomy (trach) appears to be malfunctioning, and she is unable to speak with the balloon deflated. She has an 8.0 trach placed on [Date]. Thoracics were called to evaluate for trach downsizing.

   Had delta MS and head CT/MRI showed multiple infarcts.  TEE [**8-2**]
   negative for vegetations.  [**7-30**] had worsening bronchospasm on vent so
   was empirically started on solumedrol with significant improvement in

   given thrombotic microangiopathy (plus fever, altered mental status,
   renal failure, thrombocytopenia) but Heme & Transfusion Medicine don't
   think so (also was on plavix which can cause TTP so that was stopped).
   Currently, there does not appear to be any ongoing thrombosis for a
   while--off heparin gtt now.
     More recently completed course of ceftaz for acinetobacter PNA.  Also
   has + CMV viral load was on ganciclovir but now off because role of CMV
   viremia unclear.  [**9-6**] new thrombocytopenia down to 24-? med effect,

   MS is improving.   Has developed MAT with occ PSVT up to 160s, now
   better on amio.  Low CvO2 and rising lactate, so started dobumatine for
   cardiogenic shock (echo shows 4+ MR) about 2 weeks ago.  At same time,
   getting amiodarone given her atrial irritability and risk of dobuta.
   She is back on HD and tolerating well and have been able to remove few

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the hospital in respiratory distress and was intubated. She was diagnosed with NSTEMI, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, ARF, sepsis, Acinetobacter PNA, and CMV viremia. The patient has undergone multiple medical interventions, including cardiac catheterization, tracheostomy, renal biopsy, and hemodialysis. She has also experienced thrombotic complications, including dry gangrene of both feet and digital ischemia of bilateral hands. The patient's current condition includes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), atrial fibrillation with mat, cardiogenic shock, thrombocytopenia, sepsis, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's heart is not pumping enough blood to meet the body's demands, leading to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Thrombotic microangiopathy: The patient has evidence of thrombosis in small blood vessels, which can lead to organ damage, particularly affecting the kidneys and brain.
3. Sepsis: The patient has had multiple episodes of infection, indicating an increased risk for sepsis and its associated complications, such as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning"

   HPI:
   44 y/o F w/asthma who presented to OSH [**7-22**] in respiratory distress,
   intubated after arrival. Ruled in by enzymes so transferred here to
   cath lab.  Had 100% distal RCA stenosis s/p BMS x2.  TTE with EF 45%.
   Had delta MS and head CT/MRI showed multiple infarcts.  TEE [**8-2**]
   negative for vegetations.  [**7-30**] had worsening bronchospasm on vent so
   was empirically started on solumedrol with significant improvement in
   lung exam but no change in fevers or mental status.  Transferred to
   MICU [**7-31**] given multiple ongoing noncardiac issues.  Rheum, ID, Derm,
   Neuro, Renal, Heme all have been consulted at one time or another.
   Developed ARF>>renal biopsy showed thrombotic microangiopathy.  Repeat
   MRI x2 showed expected evolution of prior infarcts.  EEG
   w/toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.   Had trach [**8-7**].  Due to worsening
   renal function and uremia, was begun on HD [**8-10**].  Had fever [**8-11**], blood
   cx w/coag neg staph so line was changed.  Has had rising CK (to 14000s)
   of unclear etiology - per rheum unlikely to be myositis, likely rhabdo,
   now down to [**2184**].  [**8-13**] her left 1st toe was purple, Derm did biopsy
   -> thrombotic microangiopathy.
    Treated with heparin given multiple thrombotic complications.   ? TTP
   given thrombotic microangiopathy (plus fever, altered mental status,
   renal failure, thrombocytopenia) but Heme & Transfusion Medicine don't
   think so (also was on plavix which can cause TTP so that was stopped).
   Currently, there does not appear to be any ongoing thrombosis for a
   while--off heparin gtt now.
     More recently completed course of ceftaz for acinetobacter PNA.  Also
   has + CMV viral load was on ganciclovir but now off because role of CMV
   viremia unclear.  [**9-6**] new thrombocytopenia down to 24-? med effect,
   stopped capto, ganciclovir, plt have recovered.   Off levophed.
   MS is improving.   Has developed MAT with occ PSVT up to 160s, now
   better on amio.  Low CvO2 and rising lactate, so started dobumatine for
   cardiogenic shock (echo shows 4+ MR) about 2 weeks ago.  At same time,
   getting amiodarone given her atrial irritability and risk of dobuta.
   She is back on HD and tolerating well and have been able to remove few
   liters almost every day which should help her cardiogenic shock.
   Dobutamine turned off 10/23and so far ok.
   [**9-20**], new fever, getting cultured, changing out CVL which she's had
   for a while to a PICC.
   Next steps include: distal amputations of feet for dry gangrene when
   vascular is ready, cards consulted today for pre-op eval but not much
   they can do about her 4+ MR, had rec peri-op dobuta.  Also needs
   PEG/PEJ placed by surgery.  After that, [**Hospital 2078**] rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma who presented to the hospital in respiratory distress. She was intubated and diagnosed with NSTEMI, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, sepsis with Acinetobacter pneumonia, and cytomegalovirus viremia. The patient underwent multiple interventions including cardiac catheterization, tracheostomy, hemodialysis, and amputation of both feet. She has been on various medications including dobutamine, amiodarone, heparin, and ganciclovir. The patient's current condition is improving, with resolution of cardiogenic shock and tolerance of tracheostomy. However, she still has ongoing issues such as thrombocytopenia, sepsis, renal failure, and DIC.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of platelet counts and signs of bleeding is essential.
2. Sepsis: Despite completing antibiotic courses, the patient remains at risk for recurrent or persistent sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and infection parameters is necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of renal function tests and"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 479**] is a 44 yo female with h/o asthma, gastric bypass surgery,
   admitted with NSTEMI, with complicated and long hospital course and now
   with improving multiorgan system failure with DIC and digital ischemia
   and C diff infection.
   Fever- ID:  Patient febrile this morning and pancultured.
   - Will follow fever curve and hold on abx at this point.  If she spikes
   again will empirically add abx
   - RIJ may be source and will be removed once PICC is placed after the
   weekend.
   - No e/o ongoing infection;
   - Patient currently on no antibiotics
   Hypotension/tachycardia: Likely due to fluid shifts in the setting of
   dialysis.  Patient was repleted with 2.5L and started on levophed, to
   which she responded appropriately.  This didn
t appear to be due to an
   infectious cause.
   - Will discuss with renal CVVH vs HD in this patient
   ?Cardiogenic Shock: Likely cardiogenic now given 4+ MR, volume
   overload, and low SvO2, lactates.
   - Patient seen by cardiology and it was suggested that she would
   benefit from intraoperative monitoring, i.e. swan-ganz catheter.  An
   IABP was also a thought although less desirable given hx of clots.
   - Weaned off dobutamine and lactates stable
   - ECHO on [**2193-9-19**] w/ EF 45%, dilated RA, symmetric LVH, Grade III LV
   dysfunction, 4+MR, 2+ TR (increased from prior)
   Trach: patient apparently not able to speak with balloon deflated and
   rush of air heard with valve removed.  She has an 8.0 trach placed on
   [**2193-8-7**].
   - Thoracics called to eval for trach downsizing
   Prior ID issues
   CMV viremia s/p gancyclovir (DC
d on [**9-5**]). Actinobacter and
   Enterobacter VAP s/p 8 days of Cipro.C diff positive from culture from
   [**8-27**]. Acinetobacter in sputum from [**8-29**].  All abx have been stopped
   except for Po Flagyl for C diff.
   - follow up all cultures
 Urine, Blood & Sputum cultures. f/u cxr for
   infiltrate given GNR and GNdc growth
   - C difficile:  Stopped Vanco given PLTs, currently on Flagyl PO
   - VAP: acinetobacter s/p Ceftazadine ([**Date range (1) 1677**]), Cipro 8 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 1287**])
   - CMV viremia: s/p Ganciclovir (Day 1: [**Date range (1) 1678**]), check q Friday
   viral loads. VL Pending
   - Bone marrow biopsy showing necrosis, which may be in the setting of
   fungal vs AFB infection. Will f/u stains and cultures from bm
   Renal Failure: ARF, anuric, dialysis dependent with increase in Cr
   today suggestive of decreased intravascular volume. HD M,W,F. unable to
   reach fluid goal on [**9-18**] secondary to tachycardia and hypotension
   - Plan to continue HD for now
   Tachycardia/MAT: unclear etiology of tachycardia. No lung disease.
   Pressure high on previous echo, but CXRs have not indicated diffuse
   parenchymal disease.
   - repeat ECHO on [**2193-9-4**]: severe 4+ MR, similar to prior
   - On amio PO now s/p amio gtt.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV prn
   Thrombocytopenia: platelets decreased yesterday and have rebounded this
   morning.  Possible etiologies include sepsis, vancomycin.
   - HIT Negative
   - appreciate hematology recs
   GCPD/Antiplt Ab pending
   Thrombotic Microangiopathy: Unclear etiology at this time. Patient has
   evidence of this on kidneys, skin, DIC also falls into this category.
   There are case reports of this in BMT and CMV viremia in setting of
   HSV6 infection, but HSV6 negative. It is possible to see this kind of
   picture with infectious process invading her bone marrow.
   - bone marrow biopsy:  showing necrosis, which can be seen in
   infection.
   - HSV6 negative, - anto Yo and anti [**Doctor Last Name **] negative
   - plasmapheresis consult: resend ADAMST13 per Transfusion Med, still no
   indication for pheresis
   - Plavix discontinued for association with microangiopathic thrombosis
   - heparin gtt discontinued [**9-18**]
   - vascular surgery will evaluate pt for possible surgery only after
   pressors are weaned off, awaiting wean of dobutamine
   Altered MS/ CNS Infarcts: patient
s mental status has improved
   dramatically. She is continuing to respond to both yes and no
   questions. Mouthing words to nursing. Likely secondary to strokes and
   toxic-metabolic. Appears to be slowly improving.
   - still unable to move right arm, +/- move some of left hande but this
   has plateaued
   - Fentanyl and ativan boluses for pain
   - anti VGKC, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Hm, anti HSV6
   Respiratory Failure: Patient tolerating trach mask.
    Transaminitis: LFTs now stable, may be hepatic congestion.
   - Continue to follow labs - RUQ u/s: showing alternating flow, that can
   be see in CHF and vented patients
   - Meds started around time of increasing LFTs were IV Vanco (off), PO
   Vanco now stopped
    CAD: admitted with NSTEMI on [**7-23**], s/p bare metal stent to RCA
   - restart aspirin - discontinued plavix as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known Last Name] is a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, gastric bypass surgery, and previous admission for NSTEMI. She has had a complicated and prolonged hospital course, including multiorgan system failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), digital ischemia, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Current Issues:
1. Fever - Patient is febrile, and cultures have been obtained. Antibiotics will be held for now, but may be added if the patient spikes a fever again.
2. Hypotension/tachycardia - Patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to fluid shifts related to dialysis. She has been repleted with fluids and started on levophed, which she responded to appropriately. This does not appear to be an infectious cause.
3. Cardiogenic Shock - Patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, given the 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR), volume overload, and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR). She has been seen by cardiology and it was suggested that she would benefit from intraoperative monitoring, such as a Swan-Ganz catheter.
4. Tracheostomy - Patient's tracheostomy is causing difficulty in speaking and air rushing through the valve. Thoracics have been called to evaluate for trach downsizing.
5. Previous ID Issues - Patient has had previous issues with CMV"
