","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old female admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. She has a history of asthma, fibromyalgia, and tobacco abuse. The patient is currently on 50% FiO2 and showing signs of an asthma exacerbation, possibly due to bacterial or viral pneumonia, influenza, or long-term tobacco use. Other potential causes include hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, bronchodilators, and steroids. Further tests are being conducted to determine the exact cause of the respiratory distress, such as flu swab, respiratory viral culture, sputum culture, and a chest X-ray. The patient also has chest pain, which could be related to pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, anxiety, or acute coronary syndrome. The patient is still a smoker and is advised to quit. She has fibromyalgia and complains of bilateral leg pain. She is also being treated for depression, GERD/gastroparesis, and vitamin D deficiency. The patient's condition is stable, and she is expected to continue receiving ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia, there is a risk of respiratory failure if oxygenation and ventilation parameters are not adequately managed.
2. Infection: The patient's symptoms may be indicative of an underlying infection, such as bacterial or viral pneumonia. It is"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 27-year-old female with multiple medical problems including asthma, fibromyalgia, and tobacco abuse. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The likely cause of her symptoms is an asthma exacerbation, possibly precipitated by bacterial or viral pneumonia, influenza, or long-term tobacco use. Other differential diagnoses include hypersensitivity pneumonitis and Pneumocystis pneumonia. The patient is currently on various medications including Levoquin, Advair, Flovent, Xopenex, and IV Prednisone. Her condition is being monitored with ABG analysis, CRP and ESR measurements, and plans for flu swab and sputum cultures. The patient's chest pain may be due to pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, GERD, anxiety, or acute coronary syndrome. She is still a smoker and is counseled to quit. She also has complaints of bilateral leg pain related to fibromyalgia. Other medical issues include depression, GERD/gastroparesis, vitamin D deficiency, and nicotine dependence. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   26 yo female with h/o Asthma, fibromyalgia and now admitted with
   exacerbation of Asthma.  This is in the setting of fevers, cough,
   sputum concerning for infectious trigger.  Patient does have sick
   contacts with young children and does have mold exposure in current
   living environment.  WBC count is elevated but without focal
   infiltrate.  Interestingly her HCO3- is elevated which argues for
   significant chronic ventilatory compromise in addition to Asthma.  This
   combination of likely viral trigger, chronic chest wall restruction
   with obesity and acute exacerbation of asthma is driving significant
   impairment in ventilation and respiratory distress.  In addition, there
   was significant hypoxemia at time of admission which has improved.
   Importantly she does have description
   1)Asthma-With exacerbation secondary to infectious trigger (possibly
   viral).  The notion of mold as trigger is significant and of concern.
   Pneumonia-
   -Sputum
sent, viral cultures pending and fungal sent as well
   -Infiltrates do seem unlikley to be varicella but may represent
   alternative viral sources including influenza, parainfluenza, adneno
   all possible
   -No Tamilflu given 3 days of symptoms and high resistance
   -Levofloxacin to continue
   -Will wean O2 as possible
   Asthma with Acute Exacerbation
   -Xoponex
   -Advair to continue
   -Solumedrol 125 today
move to po at 24 hours if stable
   -Will need to consider use of NIV is patient with worsening or fatigue

","The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of asthma, fibromyalgia, and currently admitted with an acute exacerbation of asthma. She is also presenting with pneumonia symptoms, such as fevers, cough, and sputum production. The patient has sick contacts with young children and is exposed to mold in her living environment. Her WBC count is elevated, indicating an infection. Her HCO3- level is elevated, suggesting chronic ventilatory compromise in addition to asthma. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7 C (98.7 F), a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/60 mmHg to 148/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on aerosol-cool delivery device. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 0.84. 

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, distant S2 heart sound, symmetric chest expansion with resonant percussion note, bilateral crackles and wheezes during expiration, soft and non-tender abdomen, absence of lower extremity edema, and attentive behavior with normal movement and tone. 

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 12.3 g/dL, white blood cell count of 390 K/u"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, fibromyalgia, tobacco abuse, and other comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress, which is likely due to an asthma exacerbation with possible bacterial or viral pneumonia as precipitating causes. Other differentials include hypersensitivity pneumonitis and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 82 bpm (with a normal range of 72-104 bpm), blood pressure of 119/56 mmHg (with a normal range of 87/44-132/102 mmHg), respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 9-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on 50% FiO2. The patient is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery with a fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 70%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 18.9 mEq/L, base excess of -7 mg/dL, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 95%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of MMP (multimodal pain management) including asthma, fibromyalgia, and tobacco abuse. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress. The initial assessment suggests a likely asthma exacerbation with precipitating causes such as bacterial or viral pneumonia, influenza, or long-term tobacco use. Other differentials include eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has been started on several medications including Singular, methylprednisolone, Xopenex, ipratropium bromide, fluticasone propionate, and fluticasone-salmeterol diskus. She is also receiving levofloxacin for possible community-acquired pneumonia or atypical pneumonia. The patient's urine culture shows gram-positive bacteria with alpha-hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or lactobacillus species. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is alert and oriented. She has diffuse expiratory wheezes without crackles, and her abdomen is soft and non-distended. The patient's labs show mildly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Imaging reveals poor penetration in the chest X-ray with clearance of the left lung field and blunting of the right costophrenic angle. The patient's assessment includes respiratory distress/hypoxia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of multiple medical problems including asthma, fibromyalgia, and tobacco abuse. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's current medications include Singular, methylprednisolone, ipratropium bromide, fluticasone, fluticasone-salmeterol diskus, and levofloxacin. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly low creatinine level. Urine culture results indicate the presence of gram-positive bacteria. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen. The patient's chest X-ray shows improvement in the left lung field but continues to show blunting of the right costophrenic angle. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory distress likely due to an asthma exacerbation with possible bacterial or viral pneumonia as precipitating factors. Other possible diagnoses include hypersensitivity pneumonitis and pulmonary embolism. The patient's other medical conditions such as fibromyalgia, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and vitamin D deficiency are also noted"

   Assessment and Plan
   27 yo female with history of Asthma now admitted with exacerbation of
   Asthma which has been more severe than any experienced before.  This is
   in the setting of sick contacts, mold exposure and has had slow trend
   to better in regards to bronchospasm.
   1)Asthma-With acute exacerbation-This is persistent at this time with
   continued bronchospasm noted thorugh to this morning with little
   improvement.  Do have a concern for possible impact from undiagnosed
   upper airway compromise with paradoxical vocal cord motion.  She may
   have significant imipact from relatively low lung volumers allowing
   persistence of expiratory airflow limitation.
   -Xoponex to continue
   -Viral screen without enough cells and will continue with culture
   across time
   -Singulair
   -Methylprednisolone
   -Xoponex at max dosing

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of asthma, now admitted with an acute exacerbation. She has been experiencing severe bronchospasm and has shown little improvement despite treatment. The patient has also been exposed to sick contacts and mold. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/90 to 129/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is overweight/obese and has trace edema in both lower extremities. Physical examination reveals prominent central expiratory wheezes, more monophonic than polyphonic, which raises the question of central airways involvement. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging shows decreased lung volumes on chest X-ray. The patient continues to receive Xoponex, Singulair, and methylprednisolone for asthma management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe bronchospasm and persistent wheezing suggest ongoing respiratory compromise, which could lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Chronic pneumonia: The patient's history of asthma exacerbation and persistent respiratory symptoms raise concerns about underlying chronic pneumonia, especially considering the decreased lung volumes seen on imaging"

","The patient is a 27-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, fibromyalgia, tobacco abuse, depression, GERD/gastroparesis, and central hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia, which is likely due to an asthma exacerbation with precipitating causes such as bacterial (atypical most likely) pneumonia, viral pneumonia, influenza, and long-term tobacco use. Other potential diagnoses include hypersensitivity pneumonitis and eosinophilic pneumonia, but these are less likely given the absence of peripheral eosinophilia and other signs of vasculitis.

The patient's current regimen includes Singular, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, Xopenex nebulizer, ipratropium bromide nebulizer, fluticasone propionate inhaler, and fluticasone-salmeterol diskus. She is also on Levoquin for possible community-acquired pneumonia or atypical pneumonia. Respiratory viral cultures are pending, and an ABG will be done if the patient declines clinically. The oxygen should be weaned as tolerated, and the patient should be encouraged to ambulate. Broadening coverage may be considered if there is no clinical improvement, along with the possibility of a bronchoscopy. Pulmonary edema from the 2 liters of normal saline received in the emergency department should also be considered, and Lasix may be considered.

The plan is to continue with the current regimen, follow up on respiratory viral cultures, perform an ABG if clinically declines, wean oxygen as tolerated, encourage ambulation, consider broadening coverage if no clinical improvement, and consider a bronchoscopy.

In addition to the respiratory issues, the patient has other medical concerns such as tobacco abuse, fibromyalgia, depression, GERD/gastroparesis, chest pain, central hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and thrush. Each of these conditions requires ongoing management and follow-up.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and medical history include worsening respiratory distress, infections due"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 27-year-old female with multiple medical problems including asthma, fibromyalgia, tobacco abuse, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The leading differential for her respiratory distress is asthma exacerbation with viral pneumonia. Other possible etiologies include bacterial (atypical) pneumonia, influenza, eosinophilic PNA, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. The patient has shown significant improvement with the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and continues to be weaned off oxygen. 

The patient's current medications include Singular, Xopenex Neb, Ipratropium Bromide Neb, Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus, Levoquin, and steroids. The plan is to wean down the steroids and continue with a long-term regimen of inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. 

The patient is still a smoker and counseling has been provided to quit smoking. She is also being given nicotine patches. 

The patient complains of bilateral leg pain related to fibromyalgia and will continue with home Percocet and Lyrica. Her depression is stable and she will continue with home Cymbalta and Valium. 

She has ongoing issues with GERD/gastroesophageal reflux disease and will continue with home pantoprazole, ranitidine, and ondansetron if needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of asthma presenting with an acute exacerbation. She has been receiving various medications including bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, but she has persistent bronchospasm with prominent expiratory monophonic wheezes. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin T levels. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's persistent bronchospasm and wheezing indicate ongoing respiratory issues. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: Although the troponin T levels are elevated, there is no clear indication of an acute coronary syndrome. However, the patient may be at risk for cardiovascular complications like arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection. The pending viral cultures will help identify the causative agent, and appropriate antibiotics may need to be initiated based on the results.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), especially considering her immobility and use of anticoagulant prophylaxis.
5. Medication Reactions: Given the patient's code"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a medical history of asthma, fibromyalgia, tobacco abuse, and possibly depression. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The leading differential diagnosis includes asthma exacerbation with viral pneumonia, atypical bacterial pneumonia, influenza, eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and possibly Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to steroid use. The patient's condition has improved significantly with oxygen supplementation and she is being weaned off it. Current medications include Singular, Xopenex Neb, Ipratropium Bromide Neb, Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus, and Levoquin. Blood cultures have shown gram-positive bacteria consistent with alpha hemolytic colonies, likely alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp. The respiratory viral culture is pending, and the respiratory viral antigen screen was uninterpretable due to lack of cells. A chest X-ray showed no relevant change and ruled out pneumonia. The patient's lab results indicate mild elevation in CRP and ESR, making vasculitis unlikely. Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient is currently still a smoker and is being counseled to quit. She also has ongoing issues with fibromyalgia, depression, GERD/gastroperesis, chest pain, central hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and thrush. The patient's care plan"

","The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of MMP (likely meaning multiple medical problems), including asthma, fibromyalgia, and tobacco abuse. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis for her respiratory distress includes asthma exacerbation, viral pneumonia, bacterial (atypical) pneumonia, influenza, eosinophilic pneumonia, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 139/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheezes and a significantly prolonged expiratory phase, but no other significant findings.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 16.1 to 22.5 K/uL, elevated hematocrit levels between 37.2% and 39.5%, and a slightly elevated platelet count ranging from 357 to 424 K/uL. The creatinine level is within normal range at 0.6-0.9 mg/dL. Blood cultures are pending, while urine culture shows the presence of Gram-positive bacteria consistent with alpha-hemolytic colonies, possibly alpha-streptococcus or Lactobacillus species.

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-year-old female with a history of asthma, currently admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation. The patient's condition has shown substantial improvement. She is receiving various medications including Advair, Atrovent, Singulair, levofloxacin, Xoponex, and prednisone. The plan is to continue these medications and taper the prednisone over 7-10 days based on the patient's symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of asthma and current respiratory support indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure.
2. Chronic Pneumonia: The presence of chronic symptoms and possible infection may increase the risk of pneumonia.
3. Other: The note does not specify any other potential complications.
4. Dyspnea (Shortness of Breath): Given the patient's asthma history and ongoing treatment, dyspnea could still be a concern.
5. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed appropriately.
6. Nutrition and Glycemic Control: As the patient is in the ICU, there is a need for careful monitoring and management of nutrition and blood sugar levels.
