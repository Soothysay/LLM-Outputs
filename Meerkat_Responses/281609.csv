 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
   43 year old man with end-stage liver disease admitted with altered
   mental status, thought to be [**2-3**] hepatic encephalopathy
   #) Sepsis  - Elevated white count/lactate/hypotension
 Likely due to
   an infection on top of severely decompensated liver disease.  Unclear
   as to the etiology of the infection.  Peritoneal tap and CXR were
   reassuring.  UA bland, Blood cultures negative to date.   Distended
   abdomen with increased gas in bowel suggesting the abdomen may be the
   source.
   - surveillance cultures
   - U/A
   - Cdiff
   - CXR
   - follow white count
   - empiric treatment with Flagyl and Ceftriaxone
   - consider imaging if strong suspicion for a source
   - follow liver enzymes
   - trend lactate
   - guaic stools for possible ischemia
   #) Altered Mental Status: Acute change in mental status per wife.
   Ammonia level very elevated, + asterixis when not sedated. Very likely
   that the source of his sepsis picture instigated his altered mental
   status.
   - infection work up as above
   - correct electrolyte abnormalities
   - continue lactulose 30-60mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin
   - on ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily for SBP prophylaxis
   #) Hypotension - Pt has been hypotensive to 80s systolic this morning,
   responsive to aggressive fluid resucitation.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been secondary
   to his underlying illness and exacerbated by propofol.   Avoid propofol
   for sedation.  Consider fentanyl bolus if sedation required.
   - Continue IVF.
   - Neo drip if needed.
   - Aline for blood pressure monitoring and control
   #) Acute on chronic renal failure- Baseline 2.0.  Creatinine trend
   3.3--> 3.4 --> 3.9 --> 4.7.  Minimal urine output.   UOP not responsive
   to MAP of 70 (which he has maintained both with and without fluid
   resucitation).  Also  concern for hepatorenal syndrome.  Urine sodium
   of 10 consistent with poor perfusion and hepatorenal.
   -continue IV fluids , maintain MAP > 60
   -hold midrodine for now, will touch base with liver
   - renally dose meds
   #) Anemia
 drop in Hct from 31.9 to 26.  [**Month (only) 51**] be [**2-3**] to volume.  Assess
   for GI blood loss as well as hemolysis.
   - f/u haptoglobin, direct bili
   - stool guaic
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/[**Name (NI) 4404**] - Pt has has MELD score of 30 with high 30 day
   mortality.  If pt is not a candidate for transplant, which he has not
   been to this point, due to malnutrition and poor compliance, aggressive
   measures would not have great benefit.  GI will readdress with
   transplant team regarding possibility of being added to the transplant
   list, if he can improve from his currest state.

   #. Respiratory: On ventilator for airway protection. Doing well on
   CPAP.  He has been overbreathing with TV of 1L, improves with
   sedation.  Plan was to maintain intubation for airway protection until
   MS improves, however, pt was off propofol for 12 hrs without
   improvement in MS.   Sedation was restarted due to difficulty managing
   pt comfort and blood gases while on vent.   High fluid volume may
   impair weaning capability when mental status improves.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease and altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. He was admitted with an altered mental status and is now intubated for airway protection. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple issues, including sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, hypotension, anemia, and potential complications related to his underlying liver disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, which could lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated further, indicating acute kidney injury on top of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, toxic buildup of waste products, and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: Given the patient's liver disease and worsening renal function, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) should be considered. HRS is a type of kidney failure specifically associated with advanced liver disease and can occur when the liver's ability to produce proteins that regulate blood flow to the kidneys is impaired.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction may continue to cause altered mental status and hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by confusion, disorientation, and other neurological symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease admitted with altered mental status, believed to be hepatic encephalopathy. He has a history of multiple admissions for hepatic encephalopathy and no signs of urinary tract infection or other infection on chest X-ray.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Altered mental status with elevated ammonia levels and asterixis, but no clear precipitant.
- Hypotension in the 80s systolic, responsive to aggressive fluid resuscitation.
- ETOH cirrhosis with a MELD score of 30 and high 30-day mortality.
- Acute-on-chronic renal failure with increasing creatinine levels and minimal urine output.
- Respiratory distress requiring ventilator support for airway protection.
- Hypokalemia likely due to poor oral intake.
- Severe malnutrition.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: Continue lactulose 30-60mL TID titrated to bowel movement per day, rifaximin, ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily for SBP prophylaxis, and correct electrolyte abnormalities.
2. Hypotension: Hold off propofol, consider fentanyl bolus if sedation required. Continue IVF, Neo drip if needed, and consider a line for access and titration.
3. ETOH cirrhosis/MELD score of 30: If"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock.
   # Septic Shock: continued leukocytosis with lactic acidosis and now
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.  Patient has been pan-cultured with
   unclear etiology of infection.  To date, most likely source is lung as
   patient was recently treated for PNA, now with copious thick yellow
   secretions and blossoming LLL infiltrate on CXR.
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin,
   ceftriaxone and flagyl pending culture and gram stain results
   - consider abdominal imaging to eval. for infectious source in setting
   of bloody NG aspirate, rising LFT
s and distended abdomen, with
   distended bowel apparent on CXR
   - continue fluid boluses and pressor support for MAP > 65, add
   vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 4.7 with minimal UOP despite substantial fluid
   resuscitation and pressor support likely representing hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   - d/w renal addition of midodrine for HRS
   - renally dose all medications
   # Anemia: HCT initially trending down with blood NGT aspirate now s/p 2
   units PRBC
s with appropriate bump.  Of note, platelets also continue
   to trend down with increasing TBili, FDP and coags suggesting early
   DIC.  Patient is not candidate for EGD at this time per Liver. Patient
   placed on octreotide drip for bloody NGT aspirate
    Bloody NG aspirate may have resulted from irritation from NGT as it
   has resolved.
   - trend with TID CBC / coags to evaluate for developing DIC and
   transfuse to goal HCT > 23 and platelets > 50,000
   - guiac stool
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - set up family meeting with transplant (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] for discussion of
   prognosis as this will likely govern future management
   #. Respiratory: patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Sedation was up-titrated with
   minimal success.  This is likely physiologic response to underlying
   metabolic acidosis.
   - continue PSV at 5/5 and daily RSBI
   #. Nutrition: patient very cachetic with history of poor nutritional
   compliance
   - consider TPN vs. TF depending on bowel and absorption
   - continue megestrol and reglan
   # FEN: IVF, [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes with repletion, NPO for now pending

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who presented with altered mental status and asterixis. He has been treated for pneumonia but now has a worsening lung infection with copious thick yellow secretions and increased left lower lobe infiltrate on CXR. The patient is experiencing septic shock, requiring pressor support and fluid boluses. He also has acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, and possible early disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition is complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, which is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin. He has a MELD score of 30 and is not currently a transplant candidate. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is overbreathing on the ventilator. He is cachectic and may require nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening lung infection: The patient has an increased left lower lobe infiltrate on CXR, indicating a worsening lung infection. This could potentially lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Septic shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, which are signs of septic shock. If not appropriately managed, septic shock can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is exhibiting signs of hepatic en"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock.
   # Septic Shock: continued leukocytosis with lactic acidosis and now
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.  Patient has been pan-cultured with
   unclear etiology of infection.  To date, most likely source is lung as
   patient was recently treated for PNA, now with copious thick yellow
   secretions and blossoming LLL infiltrate on CXR.
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin,
   ceftriaxone and flagyl pending culture and gram stain results
   - consider abdominal imaging to eval. for infectious source in setting
   of bloody NG aspirate, rising LFT
s and distended abdomen, with
   distended bowel apparent on CXR
   - continue fluid boluses and pressor support for MAP > 65, add
   vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 4.7 with minimal UOP despite substantial fluid
   resuscitation and pressor support likely representing hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   - d/w renal addition of midodrine for HRS
   - renally dose all medications
   # Anemia: HCT initially trending down with blood NGT aspirate now s/p 2
   units PRBC
s with appropriate bump.  Of note, platelets also continue
   to trend down with increasing TBili, FDP and coags suggesting early
   DIC.  Patient is not candidate for EGD at this time per Liver. Patient
   placed on octreotide drip for bloody NGT aspirate
    Bloody NG aspirate may have resulted from irritation from NGT as it
   has resolved.
   - trend with TID CBC / coags to evaluate for developing DIC and
   transfuse to goal HCT > 23 and platelets > 50,000
   - guiac stool
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - set up family meeting with transplant (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] for discussion of
   prognosis as this will likely govern future management
   #. Respiratory: patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Sedation was up-titrated with
   minimal success.  This is likely physiologic response to underlying
   metabolic acidosis.
   - continue PSV at 5/5 and daily RSBI
   #. Nutrition: patient very cachetic with history of poor nutritional
   compliance
   - consider TPN vs. TF depending on bowel and absorption
   - continue megestrol and reglan

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status. The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, with the development of septic shock. He is experiencing hypotension, requiring pressor support, along with leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, and an unclear etiology of infection. The patient's lungs appear to be the most likely source of infection, given his recent pneumonia treatment and current worsening left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.

The patient is also showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by asterixis and confusion. Infection workup and empirical treatment have been initiated. The patient's renal function has worsened, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome, and he requires close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance.

Additionally, the patient has anemia with a decreasing hemoglobin concentration and is receiving packed red blood cells (PRBCs). There are concerns about developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as indicated by the increasing fibrin degradation products (FDP), thrombocytopenia, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient's liver disease is likely causing portal hypertension, leading to splenomegaly and subsequent thrombocytopenia.

The patient's nutritional status is poor, and he requires further evaluation for enteral or parenteral nutrition. His respiratory status is stable"

   # Septic Shock: continued leukocytosis with lactic acidosis and now
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.  Patient has been pan-cultured with
   unclear etiology of infection.  To date, most likely source is lung as
   patient was recently treated for PNA, now with copious thick yellow
   secretions and blossoming LLL infiltrate on CXR.
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin,
   ceftriaxone and flagyl pending culture and gram stain results
   - consider abdominal imaging to eval. for infectious source in setting
   of bloody NG aspirate, rising LFT
s and distended abdomen, with
   distended bowel apparent on CXR
   - continue fluid boluses and pressor support for MAP > 65, add
   vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 4.7 with minimal UOP despite substantial fluid
   resuscitation and pressor support likely representing hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   - d/w renal addition of midodrine for HRS
   - renally dose all medications
   # Anemia: HCT initially trending down with blood NGT aspirate now s/p 2
   units PRBC
s with appropriate bump.  Of note, platelets also continue
   to trend down with increasing TBili, FDP and coags suggesting early
   DIC.  Patient is not candidate for EGD at this time per Liver. Patient
   placed on octreotide drip for bloody NGT aspirate
    Bloody NG aspirate may have resulted from irritation from NGT as it
   has resolved.
   - trend with TID CBC / coags to evaluate for developing DIC and
   transfuse to goal HCT > 23 and platelets > 50,000
   - guiac stool
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - set up family meeting with transplant (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] for discussion of
   prognosis as this will likely govern future management
   #. Respiratory: patient continues to substantially overbreathe

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) presenting with altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing asterixis (involuntary finger-like movements of the hands) and taking extra doses of lactulose. He also reported some vomiting the previous night but no other symptoms. The patient had recently been discharged on September 30th with similar symptoms and was treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin. A CT head was performed, which was negative, and a chest X-ray overnight showed an increasing left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate.

The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, with the following notable events:

1. Central line and arterial line placement.
2. Bloody NGT (nasogastric tube) aspirate with dropping hematocrit levels, requiring transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
3. Trending down platelet count, elevated FDP (fibrin degradation products), and increasing coagulation INR, suggesting early disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Consultation with the liver team, who do not feel endotracheal intubation is appropriate given the current level of illness.
5. Family meeting with GI (gastrointestinal) team regarding poor prognosis but wanting full care, and considering re-evaluation after meeting with transplant (Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 1174] in the morning).
6. Patient becoming hypotensive, started on levo-dopamine (Levo) drip for mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65.
7. Started on empiric vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with blossoming LLL infiltrate.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
- Heart rate: 128 bpm
- Blood pressure: 113/57 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 32 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

- White blood cell count: 19.2 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 26.0 g/dL
- Platelet count: 112 K/uL
- Creatinine: 4.7 mg/dL

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock.
   # Septic Shock: continued leukocytosis with lactic acidosis and now
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.  Patient has been pan-cultured with
   unclear etiology of infection.  To date, most likely source is lung as
   patient was recently treated for PNA, now with copious thick yellow
   secretions and blossoming LLL infiltrate on CXR.
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin,
   ceftriaxone and flagyl pending culture and gram stain results
   - consider abdominal imaging to eval. for infectious source in setting
   of bloody NG aspirate, rising LFT
s and distended abdomen, with
   distended bowel apparent on CXR
   - hold off on fluid boluses this AM and use pressor support for MAP >
   60, add vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 4.7 with minimal UOP despite substantial fluid
   resuscitation and pressor support likely representing hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   - add midodrine for HRS as it may support pressures and help renal
   function
   - renally dose all medications
   # Anemia: HCT initially trending down with blood NGT aspirate now s/p 2
   units PRBC
s with appropriate bump.  Of note, platelets also continue
   to trend down with increasing TBili, FDP and coags suggesting early
   DIC.  Patient is not candidate for EGD at this time per Liver. Patient
   placed on octreotide drip for bloody NGT aspirate.  Bloody NG aspirate
   may have resulted from irritation from NGT as it has resolved.
   - trend with TID CBC / coags to evaluate for developing DIC and
   transfuse to goal HCT > 23 and platelets > 50,000
   - guiac stool
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - set up family meeting with transplant (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] for discussion of
   prognosis as this will likely govern future management
   #. Respiratory: patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Sedation was up-titrated with
   minimal success.  This is likely physiologic response to underlying
   metabolic acidosis.
   - titrate up PEEP on PSV as recruitment maneuver
   #. Nutrition: patient very cachetic with history of poor nutritional
   compliance
   - consider TPN vs. TF depending on bowel and absorption
   - discontinue megestrol and reglan

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) presenting with altered mental status, likely septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction. The patient has been treated for pneumonia and is now showing worsening lung infiltrates. The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, with signs of hepatic encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's prognosis is poor, and the family is considering a transplant evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to an underlying infection, which can lead to hypotension, organ failure, and death if not promptly treated.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction and characterized by confusion, asterixis, and other neurological symptoms.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, which can be a result of hepatorenal syndrome in the setting of ESLD.
4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's decreasing platelet count, increased fibrin degradation products, and elevated INR suggest the development of DIC, a serious condition involving widespread activation of clotting factors and subsequent bleeding.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory alkalosis and worsening lung"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo male with history of cirrhosis and now with admission with sepsis
   and worsening liver and renal failure.  He has hospital course
   complicated by worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia and now has
   pressor requiring septic shock.
   1)Sepsis-We have likely pulmonary or abdominal source but no orienting
   culture results.  He has striking pulse pressure variation with
   respiratory cycle which may be a marker for continued hypovolemia and
   fluid responsiveness going forward.  He may well be faced with
   persistent decrease in splanchnic SVR
   -CTX/Flagyl/Cipro/Vanco to continue
   -Levophed as needed, may benefit from vasopressin if there is
   additional benefit in regards to splanchnic contribution to decreased
   SVR.
   _Will maintain HCT at stable levels and target closer to 30
   -Fluid bolus as needed today
   -Will attempt to keep CVP at >6 as needed and will move to pressors as
   primary mode of support if MAP decrease is seen
   -
   2)Respiratory Failure-Patient with respiratory alkalosis in recent past
   and has been maintained with PSV at this time in the setting of now
   left sided pneumonia
   -Continue with PSV
   -Maintain PEEP=5
10 in the setting of altered chest wall mechanics
   -Mental status and worsening sepsis and worsening renal failure all
   prevent any consideration of extubation
   3)Renal Failure-
   -Renally dose all medication
   -Na+ <10 in urine concerning for hepatorenal and we have done
   optimization of fluid balance
   -Bladder pressure to check for possible contribution to renal failure
   -Will continue Midodrine/Octreotide for contribution from hepato-renal
   syndrome
   -ATN likely playing a role and will work to minimize with stabilization
   of perfusion.
   4)Anemia-
   -OCtreotide/PPI
   -Follow HCT
   -Concern for GI losses
   5)Thrombocytopenia-[**Month (only) 51**] be contribution from DIC and contribution from
   splenic sequestration
   -Continue supportive care
   6)Acidosis--Anion gap acidosis in the setting of mild lactate elevation
   and renal failure and no-gap acidosis as well
   -HCO3- in fluids as reasonable
   7)Cirrhosis
   -Rifax, Lactulose
   -Family needs frank discussion of patient
s continued and unchanging
   clinical decline in the setting of cirrhosis and unavailability for
   transplant.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, who has been admitted to the ICU with sepsis and worsening liver and renal failure. He has experienced complications such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, renal failure, and acidosis. The patient's condition remains critical, and there is a discussion regarding the continued clinical decline in the setting of cirrhosis and the unavailability for transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Liver Failure: The patient has worsening liver failure, which can result in impaired liver function and the accumulation of toxins in the body.
3. Renal Failure: The patient also has renal failure, which can lead to decreased kidney function and the buildup of waste products in the body.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock.
   # Septic Shock: continued leukocytosis with lactic acidosis and now
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.  Patient has been pan-cultured with
   unclear etiology of infection.  To date, most likely source is lung as
   patient was recently treated for PNA, now with copious thick yellow
   secretions, 4+ gram positive cocci on sputum gram stain, and CXR
   showing new left sided and perihilar consolidations suggestive of an
   aspiration PNA given rapidity of evolution.
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vancomycin ( for GPCs),
   ciprofloxacin and flagyl (gram negs and anaerobes for aspiration
   event), and ceftriaxone (SBP prophylaxis)
   - hold off on fluid boluses this AM and use pressor support for MAP >
   60, add vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 4.7 with minimal UOP despite substantial fluid
   resuscitation and pressor support likely representing hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   - add midodrine for HRS as it may support pressures and help renal
   function
   - renally dose all medications
   # Anemia: HCT initially trending down with blood NGT aspirate now s/p 2
   units PRBC
s with appropriate bump.  Of note, platelets also continue
   to trend down with increasing TBili, FDP and coags suggesting early
   DIC.  Patient is not candidate for EGD at this time per Liver. Patient
   placed on octreotide drip for bloody NGT aspirate.  Bloody NG aspirate
   may have resulted from irritation from NGT as it has resolved.
   - trend with TID CBC / coags to evaluate for developing DIC and
   transfuse to goal HCT > 23 and platelets > 50,000
   - guiac stool
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - set up family meeting with transplant (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] for discussion of
   prognosis as this will likely govern future management
   #. Respiratory: patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Sedation was up-titrated with
   minimal success.  This is likely physiologic response to underlying
   metabolic acidosis.
   - titrate up PEEP on PSV as recruitment maneuver
   #. Nutrition: patient very cachetic with history of poor nutritional
   compliance
   - consider TPN vs. TF depending on bowel and absorption
   - discontinue megestrol and reglan
   # FEN: IVF, [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes with repletion, NPO for now pending

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who presented with altered mental status and is now likely in septic shock. He has leukocytosis with lactic acidosis and hypotension requiring pressor support. The source of infection is unclear, but it is suspected to be in the lungs as the patient had a recent pneumonia and now has copious thick yellow secretions, along with new left-sided and perihilar consolidations on chest X-ray suggestive of an aspiration pneumonia.

The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacteria, and anaerobes respectively. Ceftriaxone is also being given for prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient has decompensated liver disease with severely altered mental status, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy triggered by the underlying infection. He is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 now elevated to 4.7. This is likely hepatorenal syndrome, supported by low urine output and sodium levels. Midodrine is being added to support renal function.

The patient has anemia with a decreasing hematocrit and has received "

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock.
   # Septic Shock: continued leukocytosis with lactic acidosis and now
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.  Patient has been pan-cultured with
   unclear etiology of infection.  To date, most likely source is lung as
   patient was recently treated for PNA, now with copious thick yellow
   secretions, 4+ gram positive cocci on sputum gram stain, and CXR
   showing new left sided and perihilar consolidations suggestive of an
   aspiration PNA given rapidity of evolution.
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vancomycin ( for GPCs),
   ciprofloxacin and flagyl (gram negs and anaerobes for aspiration
   event), and ceftriaxone (SBP prophylaxis)
   - hold off on fluid boluses this AM and use pressor support for MAP >
   60, add vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   #. Respiratory: Patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Currently is on pressure
   support with PEEP of 10, FiO2 of 40%.  Most recent ABG is
   .  Unclear what is driving his minute ventilation up; does have
   underlying metabolic acidosis, however likely has superimposed
   respiratory alkalosis; could be triggering breaths due to spasmodic
   facial grimacing/biting.  Sedation was up-titrated with some success.
   - Based on most recent gas, would continue PSV and increase sedation as
   necessary.
   -
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 4.7 with minimal UOP despite substantial fluid
   resuscitation and pressor support likely representing hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   - add midodrine for HRS as it may support pressures and help renal
   function
   - renally dose all medications
   # Anemia: HCT initially trending down with blood NGT aspirate now s/p 2
   units PRBC
s with appropriate bump.  Of note, platelets also continue
   to trend down with increasing TBili, FDP and coags suggesting early
   DIC.  Patient is not candidate for EGD at this time per Liver. Patient
   placed on octreotide drip for bloody NGT aspirate.  Bloody NG aspirate
   may have resulted from irritation from NGT as it has resolved.
   - trend with TID CBC / coags to evaluate for developing DIC and
   transfuse to goal HCT > 23 and platelets > 50,000
   - guiac stool
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - set up family meeting with transplant (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] for discussion of
   prognosis as this will likely govern future management
   #. Respiratory: patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Sedation was up-titrated with
   minimal success.  This is likely physiologic response to underlying
   metabolic acidosis.
   - titrate up PEEP on PSV as recruitment maneuver
   #. Nutrition: patient very cachetic with history of poor nutritional
   compliance
   - consider TPN vs. TF depending on bowel and absorption
   - discontinue megestrol and reglan
   # FEN: IVF, [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes with repletion, NPO for now pending

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and altered mental status.
- He is currently in septic shock, likely due to a lung infection, as evidenced by the presence of gram-positive cocci on sputum gram stain and new left-sided and perihilar consolidations on chest X-ray.
- The patient has been pan-cultured, indicating an unclear etiology of infection.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as anaerobes, in anticipation of an aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient's respiratory alkalosis is being managed by adjusting sedation levels and using pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 40%.
- The patient's altered mental status is attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin.
- The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely representing hepatorenal syndrome, with a creatinine level of 4.7.
- Anemia is being treated with red blood cell transfusions, and there are concerns about early disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to trends in coagulation studies.
- The patient has ESLD secondary to alcohol abuse, with a MELD score of 30, making him not a candidate for transplantation at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock.
   # Septic Shock: continued leukocytosis with lactic acidosis and now
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.  Patient has been pan-cultured with
   unclear etiology of infection.  To date, most likely source is lung as
   patient was recently treated for PNA, now with copious thick yellow
   secretions, 4+ gram positive cocci on sputum gram stain, and CXR
   showing new left sided and perihilar consolidations suggestive of an
   aspiration PNA given rapidity of evolution.  However, given high fevers
   this AM and onset of convulsions, need to consider other sources.
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vancomycin ( for GPCs),
   ciprofloxacin and flagyl (gram negs and anaerobes for aspiration
   event), and ceftriaxone (SBP prophylaxis)
   - hold off on fluid boluses this AM and use pressor support for MAP >
   60, add vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   - Given high fevers and convulsions:  obtain head CT  and then LP if
   not at risk for herniation, consult neurology.   Start empirical
   coverage for viral and bacterial meningitis (start acyclovir,
   ampicillin) in addition to abx regimen.
   - Obtain body CT in addition to head CT per above to look for other
   infectious sources including abscesses, biliary pathology;
   - Skin exam to look for ulcers, other lesions
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Convulsions usually last < 30 seconds and resolve
   spontaneously.  If seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy (BUN is 118), infectious
   (meningitis), ischemic.
   -Head CT today followed by LP
   -Bedside EEG
   -Versed drip PRN convulsions
   -Consult neurology
   -Consider MRI to r/o ischemic causes however would be difficult to do
   this practically given respiratory status
   .
   #. Respiratory: Patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Currently is on pressure
   support with PEEP of 10, FiO2 of 40%.  Could be triggering breaths due
   to spasmodic facial grimacing/biting.  Sedation was up-titrated with
   some success although given persistent respiratory distress, switched
   to Assist control.
   -Continue on assist: most recent gas shows improvement in alkalosis.
   Increase sedation as necessary to reduce overbreathing.
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 6.2 in short period with minimal UOP despite substantial
   fluid resuscitation and pressor support concerning for hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   -          added midodrine yesterday but creatinine continues to
   worsen.  Need to improve renal perfusion; can give albumin and increase
   pressor support to increase MAP > 10
   -          Trend creatinines, ensure that renal is following
   #Thrombocytopenia
   Initially we were concerned with DIC picture given dropping platelets
   however they have since come back up to 110; fibrinogen levels are
   normal and FDP are low 10
 40.  Most likely cause of acute platelet
   drop is worsening of liver disease; no need to transfuse plaetelets.
   INR is stable at 2.5
 2.6.  HCTS are stable and not actively
   bleeding.   Check coags and platelets daily.
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - family meeting yesterday; family continues to pursue aggressive tx
   even though Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] has told them about poor prognosis.  Meeting with
   family again today to discuss further worsening of his prognosis given
   deteriorating renal function, liver function and neurological status.

His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH 7.57, PaCO2 18 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 290, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 16 mEq/L.

Laboratory findings reveal leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.0 K/uL, hyponatremia with sodium (Na+) level of 104 mg/dL, elevated liver enzymes including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 81 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 29 U/L, decreased platelet count of 91 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 6.2 mg/dL, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 118 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes ESLD, acute on chronic renal failure, and chronic thrombocytopenia. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, for suspected sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. Other medications include pantoprazole, fentanyl, and octreotide.

The patient's prognosis is poor due to deteriorating renal function, liver function, and neurological status. A family meeting was held to discuss the worsening prognosis and the limitations of aggressive treatment options."

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo male with history of cirrhosis and now with admission with sepsis
   and has been with continued clinical decline seen represented by
   worsening sepsis, persistent respiratory failure and concern for
   intermittent fever and persistent tachycardia.  The patient has had
   persistent fever and hypotension concerning for persistent sepsis
   despite optimal medical treatment.  In addition he now has right sided
   rhythmic activity which has expanded and he has rightward nystagmus
   concerning for evolution of signficant cerebral insult and possible
   edema.  He has worsening renal failure which has progressed despite
   maximal therapy at this time.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with left lower lobe pneumonia.  He has
   persistent dense alteration of mental status.  He has ongoing need for
   full ventilatory status.
   -Continue with A/C support
   -Continue with PEEP today at elevated pressures
   -Will continue to follow pH and mitigate respiratory alkalosis.
   2)Sepsis-Likely source has been pulmonary source with infiltrate and
   sputum with gram positive cocci seen and with sudden onset of
   infiltrate aspiration is of concern.  In terms of alternative
   sources
SBP has been considered and Cipro is in place.  With new onset
   seizure activity concern for meningitis is significant and will have to
   consider LP for evaluation but this will be a challenge in the setting
   of coagulopathy with additional concern for cerebral edema.
   _CTX/Cipro/Flagyl/Vanco in place
   -Levophed
   -Will expand to meningitis dosing for CTX, add acyclovir
   -Patient with CVL in place for 2 days
no positive blood cultures and
   will continue to follow
   -Will continue with coverage for SBP
   -Do not seen evidence of LAE
s to suggest cholecystitis but do have a
   concern for possible acalculous cholecystitis
   -Will have to be non-contrast study today given concern for renal
   failure and inability to tolerate po intake
   3)Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions
they do appear to
   be quite focal events with seizure threshold altered in the setting of
   acute illness.  It does raise the concern for a focal deficit as this
   has been clearly seen to evolve over past 12-24 hours.  Although there
   is risk to movement we will need to pursue imaging this morning.
   -CT this morning
   -EEG this morning
   -Will need neurology consultation to aid in evaluation and treatment
   -Will broaden antibiotics
   -Will move to Rx with Benzo if they are persistent
   4)Cirrhosis-
   -Lactulose
   -Thiamine/MVI
   -Appreciate support of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] and GI service
   5)Acute Renal Failure-Appears to be hepatorenal or pre-renal and
   hepatorenal is of greatest concern.
   -Midodrine/Octreotide
   -Fluids to remain volume replete
   -Would not consider dialysis appropriate in this setting of continued
   clinical decline in all other organ systems
   -We have maintained adequate MAP >65
   -Midodrine not able to be absorbed with po pathway
is on levophed at
   this time.
   -Will use albumin for fluid support today.
   -Appreciate renal input

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis. He was admitted with sepsis and has been experiencing a continuous clinical decline, represented by worsening sepsis, persistent respiratory failure, intermittent fever, and persistent tachycardia. The patient also has right-sided rhythmic activity, which has expanded, along with rightward nystagmus, concerning for a significant cerebral insult and possible edema. Additionally, he has worsening renal failure that has progressed despite maximal therapy.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent dense alteration of mental status and ongoing need for full ventilatory status. It is important to continue with assisted ventilation support and monitor pH levels to mitigate respiratory alkalosis.

2. Sepsis: The likely source of sepsis is a pulmonary source with an infiltrate and sputum with gram-positive cocci seen. There is a concern for meningitis, especially with new-onset seizure activity. Considering the coagulopathy and concern for cerebral edema, a lumbar puncture for evaluation will be challenging.

3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: These convulsions appear to be quite focal events with an altered seizure threshold in the setting of acute illness. There is a concern for a focal deficit as it has evolved over the past 12-24 hours. Imaging (CT) and electro"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. He has persistent fever, hypotension, worsening renal failure, and altered mental status with intermittent convulsions. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics (CTX/Cipro/Flagyl/Vanco), vasopressor (Levophed), and others. The patient's condition has been declining despite maximal therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a decline in oxygenation or if the ventilator settings need to be adjusted.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly. There is a risk of multiple organ dysfunction due to sepsis.
3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate further, leading to increased frequency and severity of convulsions.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, resulting in further fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance may become more unstable, requiring careful monitoring and management.
6. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's liver function may worsen due to cirrhosis and sepsis, leading to hepatic encephal"

   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock.
   # Septic Shock: continued leukocytosis with lactic acidosis and now
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.  Patient has been pan-cultured with
   unclear etiology of infection.  To date, most likely source is lung as
   patient was recently treated for PNA, now with copious thick yellow
   secretions, 4+ gram positive cocci on sputum gram stain, and CXR
   showing new left sided and perihilar consolidations suggestive of an
   aspiration PNA given rapidity of evolution.  However, given high fevers
   and onset of convulsions, need to consider other sources.  PNA is
   likely given CT and Xray findings today.  Elevated fever may have
   central etiology also.
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vancomycin ( for GPCs),
   ciprofloxacin and flagyl (gram negs and anaerobes for aspiration
   event), and ceftriaxone (SBP prophylaxis)
   - hold off on fluid boluses this AM and use pressor support for MAP >
   60, add vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   - LP deferred given brain edema and high INR and technical difficulty
   given seizures.   CT  and then LP if not at risk for herniation,
   consult neurology.   Start empirical coverage for viral and bacterial
   meningitis (start acyclovir, ampicillin, meningitis dosed ceftriax) In
   addition to abx regimen.
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Convulsions usually last < 30 seconds and resolve
   spontaneously.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy (BUN is 118), infectious
   (meningitis), ischemic.
   -Bedside EEG
   -Versed drip PRN convulsions
   -Continue Keppra per neurology (bolused on [**10-10**])
   - Ischemia also on differential - however head MRI would not change
   management at this time
   #. Respiratory: Patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Currently is on pressure
   support with PEEP of 10, FiO2 of 40%.  Could be triggering breaths due
   to spasmodic facial grimacing/biting.  Sedation was up-titrated with
   some success although given persistent respiratory distress, switched
   to Assist control.
   -Continue on assist: most recent gas shows improvement in alkalosis,
   given new respiratory acidosis.  Increase sedation as necessary to
   reduce overbreathing.
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.   Now presents
   with whole brain edema.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 6.6 in short period with minimal UOP despite substantial
   fluid resuscitation and pressor support concerning for hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.  UOP of 275 cc
   daily.
   -          added midodrine yesterday but creatinine continues to
   worsen.  Need to improve renal perfusion; can give albumin and increase
   pressor support to increase MAP > 10
   -          Trend creatinines
   -          [**Month (only) 51**] require dialysis as renal function could be clouding his
   mental status inadditon to above
   #Thrombocytopenia
   Initially we were concerned with DIC picture given dropping platelets
   however they have since come back up to 110; fibrinogen levels are
   normal and FDP are low 10
 40.  Most likely cause of acute platelet
   drop is worsening of liver disease; no need to transfuse plaetelets.
   INR is stable at 2.5
 2.6.  HCTS are stable and not actively
   bleeding.   Check coags and platelets daily.
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - talked to wife yesterday she says she just wants to wait.  Mother
   will decide his code status and make final decisions.
   - Meeting with family again today to discuss further worsening of his
   prognosis given deteriorating renal function, liver function and
   neurological status.
   #. Nutrition: patient very cachetic with history of poor nutritional
   compliance
   - no TF as bowel isn't working
   - consult nutrition and start TPN
   # FEN: IVF, [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes with repletion, TPN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) presenting with multiple medical complications. The patient's current conditions include:

1. Seizure: The patient has been experiencing convulsions, which are likely secondary to underlying hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy, infectious etiology, or ischemic causes.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output despite fluid resuscitation. This may be due to hepatorenal syndrome, supported by urine sodium levels less than 10.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypokalemia. These imbalances can contribute to the patient's overall condition.

4. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis suggests a systemic infection. The likely source of infection is pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia given the findings on chest X-ray and sputum gram stain showing gram-positive cocci.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient initially presented with acute change in mental status and asterixis, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy. Now, the patient has whole brain edema, which may be contributing to the altered mental status.

6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to overbreathing on the ventilator. There is a need for pressure support and adjustment of sedation to reduce overbreathing.

7. Acute on Chronic Liver Failure: The patient's liver function has significantly deteriorated, as indicated by elevated bilirubin levels and impaired synthetic function (evidenced by low albumin). The patient is also experiencing hepatic encephalopathy.

8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had a drop in platelet count, initially concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but now appears to be related to worsening liver disease. There is no need for platelet transfusion at this time.

9. Ethanol Cirrhosis/ESLD: The patient has a history of ethanol cirrhosis and ESLD, with a MELD score of 30. The patient is currently not a transplant candidate.

10. Nutrition: The patient is cachectic with a history of poor nutritional compliance. TPN (total parenteral nutrition) should be initiated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory distress, infections, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and further deterioration of liver function. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to address these complications and improve the patient's prognosis."

 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock.
   # Septic Shock: Pt has leukocytosis with improving  lactic acidosis and
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.   PNA is evident given CT and Xray
   findings today.  Elevated fever may have central etiology also.
   - continue broad spectrum abx with vancomycin ( for GPCs),
   ciprofloxacin and flagyl (gram negs and anaerobes for aspiration
   event), and ceftriaxone (SBP prophylaxis)
   - avoid fluid boluses this AM and use pressor support for MAP > 60, add
   vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   - LP deferred given brain edema and high INR and technical difficulty
   given seizures.   On empirical coverage for viral and bacterial
   meningitis (start acyclovir, ampicillin, meningitis dosed ceftriax) In
   addition to abx regimen.
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Convulsions usually last < 30 seconds and resolve
   spontaneously.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy (BUN is 118), infectious
   (meningitis), ischemic.  Started on Keppra, and seizures have
   improved.
   - f/u EEG
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   -Continue Keppra per neurology (started on [**10-10**])
   - Ischemia also on differential - however head MRI would not change
   management at this time
   #. Respiratory: Patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Currently is on Assist support
   with PEEP of 10, FiO2 of 40%.  Could be triggering breaths due to
   spasmodic facial grimacing/biting.   Improved respirations with current
   settings.
   -Continue on assist: most recent gas shows improvement in alkalosis,
   given new respiratory acidosis.
   - avoid sedation
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.   Now presents
   with whole brain edema.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above until more
   definitive data available
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   - currently not having BM despite lactulose enema
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 6.6 in short period with minimal UOP despite substantial
   fluid resuscitation and pressor support concerning for hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.  UOP of 275 cc over
   last 24hr
   -  Added midodrine but creatinine continues to worsen.
   - Albumin was given at doses for hepatorenal.
   -  Trend creatinines
   -  Dialysis not indicated renal function believed to be [**2-3**] to renal
   disease
   -  Holding off diuretics given requirement of pressors
   #Thrombocytopenia
   Initially we were concerned with DIC picture given dropping platelets
   however they have since come back up to 110; fibrinogen levels are
   normal and FDP are low 10
 40.  Most likely cause of acute platelet
   drop is worsening of liver disease; no need to transfuse plaetelets.
   INR is stable at 2.5
 2.6.  HCTS are stable and not actively
   bleeding.   Check coags and platelets daily.
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - Family currently wants to pursue aggressive care.
   - Daily updates to family
   #. Nutrition: patient very cachetic with history of poor nutritional
   compliance
   - no TF as bowel isn't working
   - consult nutrition and start TPN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) presenting with several acute issues. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status, and acute-on-chronic renal failure. 

The patient's condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy, and possible septic meningitis. The patient has a history of ESLD, which may have contributed to his current complications.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, indicating septic shock. The respiratory status is critical, with respiratory alkalosis and the need for ventilator support. The patient's renal function is severely impaired, with elevated creatinine levels and signs of hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's coagulation profile reveals thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 101,000/mm3, but the platelets are not actively bleeding. The INR is elevated at 3.7, indicating impaired liver function.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Empiric treatment for meningitis has also been initiated due to the suspicion of central nervous system involvement.

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to the severity of his illness and the underlying ESLD. The family has expressed a desire for aggressive care,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple health complications. These include respiratory failure, sepsis, worsening renal failure, liver failure, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired health maintenance, malnutrition, and liver function abnormalities. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been treated for pneumonia. He also has altered mental status with intermittent convulsions and is being followed by neurology. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to pneumonia and the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the pneumonia worsens or if there are complications with the mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing sepsis, which is a systemic infection that can lead to organ failure. There is a risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing additional complications.
3. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, leading to acute renal failure. This can result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid accumulation, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, leading to liver failure. This can cause complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and the inability to metabolize medications properly.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-10**]
   - continued to have convulsions in AM
   - concern for infectious process, started on meningitis dose
   antibiotics.
   - CT head showed marked edema, hypoattenuation of thalami - hypoxia.
   - CT abdomen - new LLL consolidation, already on abx
   - CT sinus - no sinusitis
   - Neuro consulted - started Keppra, EEG monitoring.  Recommended LP and
   MRI/MRV to look for other etiologies of new onset seizure.
   - U/A dirty on panculture with bacteria and yeast.  Replaced foley,
   resent U/A
   - - Renal function worsened started on hepatorenal dosing of albumin.
   - No new liver recs
   - d/c'd SQH given elevated INR and low platelets.
   [**10-11**]
   -Neuro says still having seizures - recommend changing Keppra from 500
   [**Hospital1 7**] to 750 mg [**Hospital1 7**].  Also advised that the presence of continued
   seizures makes the prognosis increasingly poor.
   -Noted by nurse to have decerebrate posturing during the day.
   -Lactulose enemas not working, now with decreased PO residuals -
   changed lactulose regimen to PO.

   pneumonia.
   CT abdomen:
   CONCLUSION:
   1. There is new mild small bowel dilatation. The wall is not thickened.
   A
   transition point is not seen. This is most likely due to ileus. The
   colon is
   decompressed.
   2. Extensive ascites as before, with evidence of cirrhotic liver and
   portal
   hypertension with splenomegaly.
   3. Left lower lobe consolidation, which is new since the previous CT.
   head CT:
   IMPRESSION: Marked interval increase of white and [**Doctor Last Name **] matter
   differentiation, with significant hypoattenuation of the thalami,
   highly
   concerning for hypoxic injury.
   Microbiology: [**10-10**]: Respiratory Culture:  Klebsiella (sensitive to
   bactrim, gent, meropenem) + coag + staph
   urine cultures:  yeast
   blood cultures: pending
   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock.
   # Septic Shock: Pt has leukocytosis with improving  lactic acidosis and
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.   PNA is evident given CT and Xray
   findings today.  Elevated fever may have central etiology also.
   -  Current abx regimen:  Vanc + amp + ceftriaxone + acyclovir (day 3)
   for meningitis coverage and cipro + flagyl (day 5) for coverage of
   aspiration PNA.  Klebsiella not being covered (sensitive to meropenem,
   gentamycin, and bactrim only).  Urine cultures show yeast, also not
   being covered (5 WBCs on UA).  Could simplify regimen by starting
   meropenem to replace cipro + flagyl.  Start fluconazole.
   - avoid fluid boluses this AM and use pressor support for MAP > 60, add
   vasopressin next if neo is not sufficient
   - LP deferred given brain edema and high INR and technical difficulty
   given seizures.   On empirical coverage for viral and bacterial
   meningitis (start acyclovir, ampicillin, meningitis dosed ceftriax) In
   addition to abx regimen.
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Convulsions usually last < 30 seconds and resolve
   spontaneously.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Started on Keppra, and seizures have improved although since
   continue, increased Keppra yesterday.
   - f/u EEG
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   -Continue Keppra per neurology (started on [**10-10**])
   - Ischemia also on differential - however head MRI would not change
   management at this time
   #. Respiratory: Patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Currently is on Assist support
   with PEEP of 10, FiO2 of 40%.  Could be triggering breaths due to
   spasmodic facial grimacing/biting.   Improved respirations with current
   settings.
   -Continue on assist: most recent gas shows improvement in alkalosis,
   given new respiratory acidosis.
   - avoid sedation
   # Altered Mental Status: patient initially presented with acute change
   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.   Now presents
   with whole brain edema.
   - Steroids could help with edema but would hold as could worsen
   infectious source.
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above until more
   definitive data available
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   - currently not having BM despite lactulose enema
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 6.6 in short period with minimal UOP despite substantial
   fluid resuscitation and pressor support concerning for hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.  UOP of 275 cc over
   last 24hr
   -  Added midodrine but creatinine continues to worsen.
   - Albumin was given at doses for hepatorenal.
   -  Trend creatinines
   -  Dialysis not indicated renal function believed to be [**2-3**] to renal
   disease
   -  Holding off diuretics given requirement of pressors
   #Thrombocytopenia
   Initially we were concerned with DIC picture: platelets have dropped
   over last 24 hours to 42; could be secondary to worsening liver disease
   although DIC still possible.  Fibrinogen levels are normal and coags
   are relatively stable.
   -Check platelets and coags this evening
   -Check FDP
   -No need to currently transfuse given no overt bleeding
   #. ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - continue treatments for hepatic encephalopathy as discussed above
   - Family currently wants to pursue aggressive care.
   - Daily updates to family
   #. Nutrition: patient very cachetic with history of poor nutritional
   compliance
   - no TF as bowel isn't working
   - consult nutrition and start TPN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who presented with acute changes in mental status, asterixis, and signs of septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and meningitis, and there is evidence of hypoxic injury on the head CT scan. The patient has leukocytosis with improving lactic acidosis and hypotension, requiring pressor support. The patient's respiratory alkalosis has improved with current ventilator settings.

Plan:
1. Simplify antibiotic regimen by starting meropenem to replace ciprofloxacin and Flagyl.
2. Start fluconazole due to yeast in urine culture.
3. Avoid fluid boluses and use pressor support for mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, adding vasopressin if needed.
4. Delay lumbar puncture (LP) due to brain edema and high INR, as well as technical difficulties caused by seizures.
5. Continue empirical coverage for viral and bacterial meningitis (acyclovir, ampicillin, and meningitis dosed ceftriaxone).
6. Increase Keppra dose for seizures.
7. Follow up with EEG.
8. Use Ativan PRN for convulsions, with caution.
9. Continue Keppra per neurology.
10. Consider head MRI to rule out ischemia, but it would not change the current management.
11. Continue assist support"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis. He was admitted with sepsis, worsening renal failure, respiratory alkalosis, and liver failure. The patient continues to have evidence of seizure activity and has been treated for pneumonia, possible meningitis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is on mechanical ventilation and has been off pressors since this morning. The patient's mental status remains altered, and he is experiencing intermittent convulsions. His respiratory failure has improved, but he still shows signs of sepsis. The patient has acute renal failure that has not improved, and his electrolytes and fluid balance are disturbed. He also has hypernatremia, gastrointestinal bleeding, impaired health maintenance, malnutrition, liver function abnormalities, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a decline in his lung function or if he develops new complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress if there is no effective control of the infection source or if his immune system weakens further.
3. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, leading to an increase in fluid retention, electrolyte imbalances, and accumulation of waste products in the body.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function may continue to decline, resulting in the"

   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on Keppra
   - f/u EEG - still pending
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   - Continue Keppra per neurology (started on [**10-10**])
   - Ischemia also on differential - however head MRI would not change
   management at this time
   - LP deferred given brain edema.
   #. Respiratory: Patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Currently is on Assist support
   with PEEP of 10, FiO2 of 40%.  Could be triggering breaths due to
   spasmodic facial grimacing/biting.   Improved respirations with current
   settings.

   in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
   triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.   Now presents
   with whole brain edema.
   - Steroids could help with edema but would hold as could worsen
   infectious source
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above until more
   definitive data available
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   #Hematuria
 started overnight, continues to have bloody urine.  Ddx is
   trauma, stones, carcinoma, spontaneous bleed.  Will wait to see if
   urine clears.  Hold off on additional testing in acute setting.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and altered mental status. He is currently septic, in shock, and experiencing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and he is on ventilator support. He has renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and thrombocytopenia. His nutritional status is poor, and he is at risk for infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of severe infection, which can lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and he is dependent on ventilator support. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease is causing alterations in mental status and neurological function. This condition can worsen if not managed properly.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding.
6. Malnutrition: The patient has a history of poor nutritional compliance and is cachectic. Malnutrition can further impair his recovery and immune function.
7. Infections: The patient is at increased risk of infections due to ESLD, immunosuppression"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who has been admitted with sepsis, worsening renal failure/hypersensitivity reaction syndrome (HRS), respiratory alkalosis/respiratory failure, and liver failure. The patient's condition is described as critically ill.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Respiratory Failure/Sepsis: The patient has been treated for lower lobe lung pneumonia with antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone). His respiratory alkalosis is stable, and he is off pressors.
2. Sepsis: The patient was previously on pressors but has been off them since yesterday morning.
3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: The patient has a head CT showing loss of grey/white matter differentiation and diffuse edema. He is given Ativan as needed for convulsions.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient is receiving lactulose, thiamine, and multivitamins for his cirrhosis.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is being treated with midodrine and octreotide for his acute renal failure.
6. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, which may be due to Foley trauma. It will be monitored for now.

The patient's overall prognosis is very poor, and it is recommended to meet with the family in the next 1-2"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal
   syndrome, with overall poor prognosis..
   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: patient initially presented
   with acute change in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic
   encephalopathy triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   Now presents with whole brain edema.  Neuro exam slightly improved.
   - Steroids could help with edema but would hold as could worsen
   infectious source
   - infection work up and empiric treatment for meningitis  as discussed
   below  until more definitive data available
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Neuro recs: prognosis for meaninful recovery low
   - Family currently wants to pursue aggressive care.
   - Daily updates to family
   - Daily neuro exams
   # Septic Shock: Pt has leukocytosis with improving  lactic acidosis and
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.   PNA is evident given CT and Xray
   findings today.  ? UTI?  All blood cultures negative/NGTD.
   -  Known Klebsiella and MRSA PNA.  ? Meningitis given fevers and new
   onset seizure.
   - Current abx regimen:  Vanc + amp + ceftriaxone (day 3) for meningitis
   coverage and  meropenem (day 1) for coverage of Klebsiella PNA.  Vanco
   also covering MRSA PNA.   D/c Acyclovir.
   - consider Bactrim to cover Klebsiella PNA and MRSA PNA.
   -  Urine + Yeast, after changed foley.....
   - avoid fluid boluses in favor of pressor support for MAP > 60
   - LP deferred given brain edema and high INR and technical difficulty
   given seizures.   On empirical coverage for bacterial meningitis
   (ampicillin, meningitis dosed ceftriax)
   - Off pressors x48hrs
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who presented with acute changes in mental status, asterixis, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy, and septic shock. He has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including ETOH cirrhosis, ESLD, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. He has been treated for various infections including Klebsiella pneumoniae and MRSA pneumonia, as well as meningitis. The patient's current condition is complicated by whole brain edema, seizures, hepatorenal syndrome, hypernatremia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe infection, low blood pressure, and organ dysfunction. Immediate management includes aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressor support.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and asterixis suggest hepatic encephalopathy. This condition requires treatment with lactulose and rifaximin.
3. Whole Brain Edema: The patient has developed whole brain edema, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration. Close monitoring and management of intracranial pressure are necessary.

   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: patient initially presented
   with acute change in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic
   encephalopathy triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   Now presents with whole brain edema.
   - Steroids could help with edema but would hold as could worsen
   infectious source
   - infection work up and empiric treatment as discussed above until more
   definitive data available
   - continue lactulose 30-60 mL TID titrated to [**4-7**] BM per day and
   rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Neuro recs: prognosis for meaninful recovery low
   - Family currently wants to pursue aggressive care.
   - Daily updates to family
   - Daily neuro exams
   # Septic Shock: Pt has leukocytosis with improving  lactic acidosis and
   hypotension requiring pressor support in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.   PNA is evident given CT and Xray
   findings today.  ? UTI?  All blood cultures negative/NGTD.
   -  Known Klebsiella and MRSA PNA.  ? Meningitis given fevers and new
   onset seizure.
   - Current abx regimen:  Vanc + amp + ceftriaxone (day 3) for meningitis
   coverage and  meropenem (day 1) for coverage of Klebsiella PNA.  Vanco
   also covering MRSA PNA.   D/c Acyclovir.
   - consider Bactrim to cover Klebsiella PNA and MRSA PNA.
   -  Urine + Yeast, after changed foley.....
   - avoid fluid boluses in favor of pressor support for MAP > 60
   - LP deferred given brain edema and high INR and technical difficulty
   given seizures.   On empirical coverage for bacterial meningitis
   (ampicillin, meningitis dosed ceftriax)
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on Keppra.  Had
   increased seizure activity [**10-14**] x2, improved with 1mg Ativan
   - f/u EEG - still pending

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who presented with acute mental status changes and asterixis, suggesting hepatic encephalopathy. He is now septic shock, with leukocytosis and improving lactic acidosis. The patient has a history of ESLD and alcohol cirrhosis, with a MELD score of 30, making him not a candidate for transplant. He has multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including respiratory alkalosis, acute kidney injury (AKI), thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is characterized by hypotension and organ dysfunction. Immediate management includes aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Pressor support may be required to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status and asterixis, indicating hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment involves lactulose to reduce ammonia levels and rifaximin to reduce bacterial production of ammonia.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output, suggesting AKI. Hepatorenal syndrome is a possible cause, given the patient's ESLD. Management includes fluid restriction, diuretics, and consideration of dialysis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis. He has been admitted with sepsis, worsening renal failure/hypersensitivity reaction syndrome (HRS), respiratory alkalosis/respiratory failure, liver failure, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired health maintenance, malnutrition, and liver function abnormalities.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure/sepsis, altered mental status with intermittent convulsions, acute renal failure, cirrhosis, hypernatremia, and a very poor overall prognosis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been treated with multiple antibiotics and medications to manage his conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to decreased oxygenation and potential respiratory arrest.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, resulting in further kidney damage or complete renal failure.

4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and other complications associated with liver dysfunction.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: There is a risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's cirrhosis and impaired health maintenance.

6. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition can wors"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal
   syndrome, with overall poor prognosis..
   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: patient initially presented
   with acute change in mental status and asterixis suggesting hepatic
   encephalopathy triggered by underlying infection, now septic shock.
   Now presents with whole brain edema.  Neuro exam slightly improved.
   -decrease Keprpra, add fosphenytoin in bolus (rec 20mg/kg, initially
   given 2mg/kg, corrected with additiona of 18mg/kg) and [**Hospital1 7**] and check
   level in am
   - Continuing empiric treatment for meningitis
   - continue decreased dose of lactulose 30 mL TID for hepatic
   encephalopathy
   - Neuro recs: poor prognosis
   - Family currently wants to pursue aggressive care.
   - Daily updates to family
   - Daily neuro exams
   # Septic Shock: Pt has WBC count trending up, continued hypotension
   requiring levophed in setting of severely decompensated liver
   disease.   PNA is evident given CT and Xray findings today.  ? UTI?
   All blood cultures negative/NGTD.
   -  For pneumonia:  known Klebsiella PNA + MRSA PNA however should be
   considered a ventilator acquired PNA so should be double covering for
   pseudomonas, especially in face of worsening WBC, increased pressor
   support, and worsening CXR.  Currently on vanc (day 6) and [**Last Name (un) 614**] (day 3)
   specifically to cover MRSA and Klebs but should add cipro (gent
   contradinx w/ such bad renal disease)
   - For meningitis coverage, continue vanc, amp and ceftriaxone (day 6).
   deferring LP as likely to be low yield since been on abx already 6 days
   - Urine repeat cx growing yeast, add fluconazole (or another drug that
   is not hepatically cleared or has hepatic insult)
   - avoid fluid boluses in favor of pressor support for MAP > 60
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on Keppra.  Had
   increased seizure activity [**10-14**] x2, improved with 1mg Ativan
   - f/u EEG - still pending
   -Neuro recs: med changes to decrease Keprpra, add fosphenytoin in bolus
   (rec 20mg/kg, initially given 2mg/kg, corrected with additiona of
   18mg/kg) and [**Hospital1 7**] and check level in am;
   prognosis for meaningful recovery low
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   # ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 30, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - tx for hepatic encephalopathy with laculose po tid titrate to [**3-5**]  BM
   daily, + enemas if not meeting goal  (400cc output yesterday)
   #. Respiratory: Patient continues to substantially overbreathe
   ventilator with respiratory alkalosis.  Currently is on Assist support
   with PEEP of 10, FiO2 of 40%.  Could be triggering breaths due to
   spasmodic facial grimacing/biting.   Improved respirations with current
   settings.
   -Continue on assist: most recent gas shows improvement in alkalosis,
   given AG metabolic acidosis (likely from renal failure)
   # Anemia - Hct stable.  No obvious bleeding.   Hct 27.3
   - PM Hct
   - Goal Hct > 21
   - Active T&S
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  prior Cr baseline of 2.0 now
   elevated to 7 in short period with minimal UOP despite substantial
   fluid resuscitation and pressor support concerning for hepatorenal
   syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.  UOP of 390cc over
   last 24hr
   -  On octreotide and midodrine but creatinine continues to worsen.
   -  Albumin was given at doses for hepatorenal [**10-12**].  Repeat albumin
   infusion, especially in setting of hypotension.
   -  Trend creatinines
   -  Dialysis not indicated renal function believed to be [**2-3**] to renal
   disease
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium increased to 152 yesterday, this am 153
   - Free water bolus 150cc q4hr, titrate up to 200 cc q4 hrs
   - Decreased lactulose but would not decrease further given continued
   encephalopathy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who presented with acute changes in mental status, asterixis, and hepatorenal syndrome. He was initially treated for suspected meningitis and septic shock, but now presents with worsening pneumonia, likely ventilator-associated. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with new whole brain edema, altered mental status, and poor prognosis. He requires aggressive care, and the family is aware of the daily updates and potential neurological deterioration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and increased pressor support suggest ongoing septic shock. Continued treatment for pneumonia, including coverage for MRSA and Klebsiella, is necessary. 
2. Convulsions: The patient has experienced seizures, which could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy, infectious meningitis, or ischemic causes. Medication adjustments have been made to manage these seizures.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to overbreathe on the ventilator, causing respiratory alkalosis. Adjustments to the assist support and PEEP settings may be needed.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but further evaluation and management are required.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened, indicating possible hepatorenal syndrome. Treatment with octreotide and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis. He has been admitted with sepsis, worsening renal failure/hypersensitivity reaction syndrome (HRS), respiratory alkalosis/respiratory failure, and liver failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. It is important to continue current ventilator management and treat the underlying cause, which is suspected to be pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has worsened, and he is back on pressors after receiving a dose of fosphenytoin. Antibiotics should be continued as prescribed, and cultures should be monitored.
3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: The patient is experiencing altered mental status with intermittent convulsions. Lorazepam (Ativan) is being administered as needed, and other antiepileptic medications like keppra and fosphenytoin are also being used.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, and management includes lactulose, thiamine, and multivitamins. Midodrine is also being administered.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure. Measures such as midodrine and octreotide are being taken to stabilize urine output and acid-base balance.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and currently admitted with sepsis, worsening renal failure/Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HRS), respiratory alkalosis/respiratory failure, and liver failure. The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Current ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and compliance of 36.7 cmH2O/mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided in the note, but the respiratory support plan is to continue current ventilator management.

2. Sepsis: The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and meropenem) for suspected meningitis. Pressors have been restarted after a dose of fosphenytoin. The patient's white blood cell count is trending up, indicating an ongoing infection. Culturing will continue to identify the causative organism.

3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: The patient is receiving lorazepam (Ativan) as needed for seizures"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and current admission for sepsis, worsening renal failure/Hepatic Respiratory Syndrome (HRS), respiratory alkalosis/respiratory failure, and liver failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, hypernatremia, seizure, acute renal failure, electrolyte & fluid disorder, severe sepsis, altered mental status, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired health maintenance, malnutrition, and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. It is important to monitor and adjust ventilator settings as needed to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which is a severe systemic infection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and cultures should be monitored for any signs of worsening infection.
3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: The patient's mental status is altered, and there are intermittent convulsions. Seizure management should continue with lorazepam as needed, and other antiepileptic medications may be considered.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which requires specific management including lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, thiamine supplementation, multivitamins, and midodrine.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) presenting with acute change in mental status, asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy, likely septic shock, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and overall poor prognosis. The patient has a history of ETOH (Ethanol) cirrhosis and ESLD, with a MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score of 30, currently not a transplant candidate.

Medical Complications:

1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which could be due to prolonged bed rest or decreased mobility.
2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has high levels of sodium in the blood, indicating hypernatremia. This could be caused by dehydration or excessive intake of sodium-rich fluids.
3. Seizure, Without Status Epilepticus: The patient experienced seizures, which could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infection (meningitis), or ischemic causes. Seizures have improved since starting on Keppra.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Kidney Injury, AKI): The patient has acute kidney injury, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome in the setting of ESLD.
5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder, Other: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) who presented with acute change in mental status, asterixis suggesting hepatic encephalopathy, and now likely septic shock. He has whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and overall poor prognosis. The patient's condition includes impaired skin integrity, hypernatremia, seizure, acute renal failure, electrolyte & fluid disorder, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, altered mental status, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and gastrointestinal bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization and decreased skin perfusion.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration, neurological symptoms, and seizures if not managed properly.
3. Seizure: The patient's seizure activity may continue or recur, potentially causing further neurological damage or injury.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys may continue to fail, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and buildup of waste products in the body.
5. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: Imbalances in electrolytes and fluids can occur due to ongoing renal dysfunction, leading to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and electrolyte disturbances.
6. Severe sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's infection may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, sepsis, worsening renal failure/hypersensitivity reaction syndrome (HRS), respiratory alkalosis/respiratory failure, and liver failure. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis, altered mental status with intermittent convulsions, gastrointestinal bleeding, impaired health maintenance, malnutrition, liver function abnormalities, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the respiratory failure worsens or if there are complications related to the ventilator, it may lead to further respiratory distress or pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. If the infection spreads or if the immune system weakens, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially multiple organ failure.

3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: The patient's altered mental status and intermittent convulsions may be a result of various factors such as electrolyte imbalances, liver failure, or sepsis. If left untreated or if it progresses, it can lead to permanent neurological damage or status epilepticus.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which is a chronic liver disease. Complications of cirrh"

   and a family freiend.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] led meeting and explained that he has
   had no improvement since last week.  His neurologic issues have also
   been an additional problem that has developed since then.  We
   reiterated to them that his chance of meaningful recovery is
   negliible.  They asked appropriate questions and would like to discuss
   with Mr. [**Known lastname 10751**] mother.  Their hopes are that Mr. [**Known lastname 9090**] has some
   inmprovement in neurological function to express his own wishes but the
   chances of this are also exceedingly slim.  For now, he remains full
   code but are they considering the information that we gave them CPR
   would be quite traumatic and unlikely to produce a meaningful result.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, sepsis, worsening renal failure, respiratory alkalosis, liver failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, and malnutrition.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a need for ongoing ventilator management.
2. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing pressor requirements due to multifactorial infections and liver failure.
3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: The patient is being treated empirically for meningitis, including viral causes, and a repeat head CT is recommended.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient is receiving lactulose, thiamine, MVI, and midodrine for cirrhosis management.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is at risk of worsening acidemia and electrolyte abnormalities with the drop in urine output. Midodrine/Octreotide is being used to manage this condition.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are a concern, and fluid repletion is being increased.

Overall, the patient's prognosis is very poor, and further discussion with the family is planned to update them on the patient's condition. The patient remains in the ICU for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and septic shock. The patient's prognosis is poor, with multiple organ dysfunction including hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, and potential complications such as seizures. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function that occurs as a result of severe liver disease. Symptoms include altered mental status, confusion, and changes in behavior.
2. Infection: The patient is on empirical antibiotics for suspected meningitis and septic shock. The presence of GPC in sputum culture indicates a possible bacterial infection.
3. Seizures: The patient has experienced seizures, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy, infection, or ischemic causes. An EEG is pending to further evaluate the cause.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 7.6. This could be related to hepatorenal syndrome secondary to ESLD.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to worsening liver disease. DIC labs are negative, ruling"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal
   syndrome, with overall poor prognosis.
   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: likely multifactorial including
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection including concern for herpatic
   encepalopathy from CT head.
   - Continuing empiric treatment for meningitis
   - continue  lactulose 30 mL TID for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Daily neuro exams
   - f/u neuro re recs for prognosis
   # Septic Shock: Pt has WBC count trending up, continued hypotension
   requiring levophed in setting of severely decompensated liver
   disease.   Sputum culture with GPC in pairs.  On Acyclovir day 4.
   Antibiotics for bacterial meningitis stopped,which is unlikely given no
   improvment on abx.
   - Urine repeat cx growing yeast, consider addition of  fluconazole if
   symptoms worsen
   - avoid fluid boluses in favor of pressure support for MAP > 60
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on  Keppra 500IV [**Hospital1 7**],

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) presenting with altered mental status and likely septic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications including whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient is also experiencing convulsions, and there is concern for hepatic encephalopathy and potential infections such as meningitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status/Cerebral Edema: The patient's altered mental status and new-onset whole brain edema may be multifactorial, including hepatic encephalopathy and infection. It is important to continue lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, monitor daily neuro exams, and follow up with neuro recommendations for prognosis.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has a trending up WBC count, continued hypotension requiring levophed, and severely decompensated liver disease. Sputum culture shows GPC in pairs. Antibiotics for bacterial meningitis have been stopped, as there has been no improvement. Consider adding fluconazole if symptoms worsen. Avoid fluid boluses in favor of pressure support for MAP > 60.

3. Convulsions: The patient is experiencing seizures that may be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infection (meningitis), or ischemic causes."

The plan includes continuing empiric treatment for meningitis, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, daily neuro exams, and following neuro recommendations for prognosis.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has a rising WBC count and continued hypotension requiring levophed due to severely decompensated liver disease. The sputum culture shows Gram-positive cocci in pairs. Antibiotics for bacterial meningitis were stopped as they did not show improvement. Additionally, there is a yeast infection in the urine, and fluconazole may be considered if symptoms worsen. Fluid boluses should be avoided in favor of pressure support for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

3. Convulsions: The patient experiences seizures that could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infectious (meningitis), or ischemic causes. Seizures have improved since starting on Keppra and fosphenytoin. Antiepileptics should be continued, and Ativan can be used as needed for convulsions"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal
   syndrome, with overall poor prognosis.
   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: likely multifactorial including
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection including concern for herpatic
   encepalopathy from CT head.
   - Continuing empiric treatment for meningitis
   - continue  lactulose 30 mL TID for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Daily neuro exams
   - f/u neuro re recs for prognosis
   # Sepsis: Pt has WBC count trending up, continued hypotension requiring
   levophed in setting of severely decompensated liver disease.   Sputum
   culture with GPC in pairs.  On Acyclovir day 4.  Antibiotics for
   bacterial meningitis stopped,which is unlikely given no improvment on
   abx.
   - Urine repeat cx growing yeast, consider addition of  fluconazole if
   symptoms worsen
   - avoid fluid boluses in favor of pressure support for MAP > 55
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on  Keppra 500IV [**Hospital1 7**],
   fosphenytoin 100mg Q12h
   - continue antiepileptics
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   # Anemia - Hct stable 24 today.  No obvious bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 7**]  Hct
   - Goal Hct > 21
   - Active T&S
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr 7.9 with minimal UOP. Likely
   hepatorenal syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.  Not
   offered dialysis given prognosis.  UOP yesterday with albumin, on
   octreotide and midodrine but creatinine continues to worsen.
   -  restart albumin?
   -  Trend creatinine
   # Hypernatremia: now improved with iL D5W yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   #Thrombocytopenia- Likely [**2-3**] to worsening liver disease.  DIC labs
   negative
   -Plaletets stable; follow daily
    # ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 45, currently not a
   transplant candidate.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to altered mental status, suspected septic shock, whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and a poor prognosis. The patient's medical history includes ESLD, altered mental status, new-onset seizures, anemia, acute-on-chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD.

Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Altered Mental Status/Cerebral Edema: The patient's altered mental status and new-onset seizures indicate a possibility of cerebral edema. This can be multifactorial, including hepatic encephalopathy and infection, such as herpes encephalopathy. Close monitoring of neurologic exams and daily neurologic recommendations are necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a WBC count trending up and continued hypotension requiring levophed in the setting of severely decompensated liver disease. Sputum culture with gram-positive cocci in pairs suggests a bacterial infection. Antibiotics for bacterial meningitis have been stopped, but further evaluation and treatment may be required.

3. Convulsions: The patient experienced seizures, primarily on the right side of the face accompanied by right-sided nystagmus of the eyes, which evolved"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal
   syndrome, with overall poor prognosis.
   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: likely multifactorial including
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection including concern for herpatic
   encepalopathy from CT head.
   - Continuing acyclovir (on day 4 of 10 day course)
   - continue  lactulose 30 mL TID for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Daily neuro exams
   - f/u neuro re recs for prognosis
   # Sepsis: Pt has WBC count up over last couple days (13.8 -> 13.6)
   continued hypotension requiring levophed in setting of severely
   decompensated liver disease.   Sputum culture with GPC in pairs, but no
   fevers, no findings on CXR suggestive of underlying PNA.
   - avoid fluid boluses in favor of pressure support for MAP > 55
   - Continue acyclovir; prior PNA abx course for Klebs + MRSA complete
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on  Keppra 500IV [**Hospital1 7**],
   fosphenytoin 100mg Q12h
   - continue antiepileptics
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   -goal phenytoin level of 20; check pheny level tomorrow given
   fluctuations in renal fnx
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr 7.9 -> 8.2; with minimal UOP.
   Likely hepatorenal syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   Not offered dialysis given prognosis.  On octreotide and midodrine but
   creatinine continues to worsen.
   -  Trend creatinine
   # Anemia - Hct stable 24 today.  No obvious bleeding.
   - daily  Hct
   - Goal Hct > 21
   - Active T&S
    # ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 45, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   - tx for hepatic encephalopathy with laculose po tid titrate to [**3-5**]  BM
   daily, + enemas if not meeting goal  (>1L output yesterday)

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) presenting with altered mental status, likely septic shock, whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and overall poor prognosis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 93/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 31 cmH2O and plateau pressure (Pplat) at 28 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases (ABG) show a pH of 7.8 g/dL, PaCO2 of 12 mEq/L, and HCO3- of 24.0%.

The patient's laboratory results reveal a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.8 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 80 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 7.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 105 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 12 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.9 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 24.0 %, and albumin of 4.0 g/dL. The patient's liver function tests show elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as elevated bilirubin levels. The patient's prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) are also elevated.

The patient's medical history includes ESLD, alcohol use disorder, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including acyclovir, lactulose, levophed, antiepileptic drugs (Keppra and fosphenytoin), and octreotide.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of altered mental status/cerebral edema, sepsis, convulsions, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, ESLD, and other conditions such as FEN (fluid, electrolytes, nutrition), prophylaxis against pneumoboots, bowel regimen, and code status. The patient's access is via an internal jugular vein, and the family has been informed of the patient's condition through a scheduled meeting.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening hepatic encephalopathy, further deterioration of renal function, development of additional infections, persistent seizures, and worsening respiratory status due to the underlying ESLD and multiorgan dysfunction."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, sepsis, worsening renal failure, respiratory alkalosis, and liver failure. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, ineffective coping, acute renal failure, altered mental status with intermittent convulsions, and cirrhosis.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation for respiratory support, and his vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but low oxygen saturation levels. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, meropenem, ampicillin, vancomycin, and acyclovir, indicating an ongoing infection.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, bilirubin, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and lactate, indicating liver and kidney dysfunction. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while platelet count is low.

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis, and the physical examination reveals abdominal distension and no peripheral edema. Neurological examination shows no attentiveness, inability to follow simple commands, and no movement or tone assessment.

The patient's plan of care includes continued respiratory support, management of sepsis, treatment for altered mental status with convulsions, and care for cirrhosis. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention."

   lungs, and brain.  We spent some time discussing his neurologic injury
   and the extremely poor prognosis for neurologic recovery.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 9090**]
   would like to understand his neurological evaluation better and see
   documentation of findings.  Patient Relations has been contact[**Name (NI) **] to

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, sepsis, worsening renal failure (acute renal failure), respiratory alkalosis, respiratory failure (not ARDS), and liver failure. He is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. The patient has ineffective coping, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, altered mental status with intermittent convulsions, cirrhosis, and oliguric acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a need for continued monitoring and management of respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently off pressors but remains at risk for further infection and sepsis-related complications.
3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: The patient has altered mental status and intermittent convulsions, which may require further evaluation and management.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis and requires ongoing management of associated complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal failure, and there is a need for ongoing monitoring and management of renal function.
6. Liver Failure: The patient has liver failure, and there is a need for ongoing monitoring and management of liver function.
7. DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) Order: The patient's family has agreed to a DNR order, indicating that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should not be performed in the event of arrest.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information from other sources may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal
   syndrome, with overall poor prognosis.
   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: likely multifactorial including
   hepatic encephalopathy high free phenytoin and holding Dilantin for 2
   doses, no chance of neurologic recovery better than persistent
   vegetative state also infection including concern for herpatic
   encepalopathy from CT head.
   - Continuing acyclovir (on day 5 of 10 day course)
   - continue  lactulose 30 mL TID for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Daily neuro exams
   #. Hyperkalemia: K 5.9, EKG without evidence of changes, given Ca and
   kayexalate
   - recheck in 4hrs
   # Sepsis: Pt has WBC count up but trending down, hypotension improved
   not requiring pressors.   Sputum culture with GPC in pairs, but no
   fevers, no findings on CXR suggestive of underlying PNA.
   - avoid fluid boluses in favor of pressure support for MAP > 55
   prior PNA abx course for Klebs + MRSA complete
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on  Keppra 500IV [**Hospital1 7**],
   fosphenytoin 100mg Q12h.
   - Hold dilantin as above x2 doses
   - continue antiepileptics
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   - phenytoin level goal [**10-13**]
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr 7.9 -> 8.2; with minimal UOP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is experiencing altered mental status, likely septic shock, whole brain edema, and hepatorenal syndrome. He has a poor prognosis and is not a candidate for liver transplantation. The patient has several medical complications including hyperkalemia, convulsions, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, ESLD, and ethanol cirrhosis. He is currently on various medications and treatments to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status/Cerebral Edema: The patient's altered mental status and new whole brain edema may be multifactorial, including hepatic encephalopathy, high free phenytoin levels, and infection.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a potassium level of 5.9, which is higher than the normal range. This could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which suggests an infection. He also has hypotension that has improved but may still be at risk for septic shock.
4. Convulsions: The patient is experiencing seizures that could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infection (meningitis), or ischemic causes.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are worsening,"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal
   syndrome, with overall poor prognosis.
   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: likely multifactorial including
   hepatic encephalopathy high free phenytoin and holding Dilantin for 2
   doses, no chance of neurologic recovery better than persistent
   vegetative state also infection including concern for herpatic
   encepalopathy from CT head.
   - Continuing acyclovir (on day 5 of 10 day course)
   - continue  lactulose 30 mL TID for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Daily neuro exams
   #. Hyperkalemia: K 5.9, EKG without evidence of changes, given Ca and
   kayexalate
   - bicarb gtt
   - recheck in 4hrs
   # Sepsis: Pt has WBC count up but trending down, hypotension improved
   not requiring pressors.   Sputum culture with GPC in pairs, but no
   fevers, no findings on CXR suggestive of underlying PNA.
   - avoid fluid boluses in favor of pressure support for MAP > 55
   prior PNA abx course for Klebs + MRSA complete
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on  Keppra 500IV [**Hospital1 7**],
   fosphenytoin 100mg Q12h.
   - Hold dilantin as above x2 doses
   - continue antiepileptics
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   - phenytoin level goal [**10-13**]
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr 7.9 -> 8.2; with minimal UOP.
   Likely hepatorenal syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   Not offered dialysis given prognosis.  On octreotide and midodrine but

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, likely septic shock, whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and poor prognosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a high white blood cell count and sputum culture showing Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive. This suggests a possible infection in the respiratory tract.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment includes continuing lactulose and daily neuro exams.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 5.9. This requires further management with calcium and kayexalate, and rechecking in 4 hours.
4. Sepsis: Although the patient's hypotension has improved without the need for pressors, there is still concern for sepsis due to the elevated white blood cell count. Monitoring and close observation are necessary.
5. Convulsions: The patient has been experiencing seizures, which could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infection (meningitis), or ischemic causes. Antiepileptic medications should be continued, and phenytoin levels should"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, sepsis, worsening renal failure (acute renal failure), respiratory alkalosis/respiratory failure, and liver failure. The patient's prognosis is extremely poor, as communicated in the family meeting yesterday. The patient has now made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) decision.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is ongoing management of respiratory failure, but it remains a critical issue.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which is likely contributing to multiple organ dysfunction. Off pressors at the moment, indicating that the septic shock may be under control temporarily.

3. Altered Mental Status with Intermittent Convulsions: The patient is experiencing altered mental status with intermittent convulsions. He is being given Ativan as needed, Keppra, fosphenytoin, and acyclovir due to temporal lobe hypodensities seen on the latest CT scan.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, and measures are being taken to manage this condition, including lactulose, thiamine, and MVI.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is worsening, with acid"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is experiencing altered mental status, septic shock, whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and a poor prognosis. The patient's condition is multifactorial and includes hepatic encephalopathy, worsening cerebral edema, and infection. 

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and IV levetiracetam (Keppra) for convulsions. The seizures are believed to be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infectious (meningitis), or ischemic causes. 

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome, with minimal urine output. Dialysis has not been offered due to the patient's poor prognosis. The patient is being treated with octreotide and midodrine but continues to worsen. 

The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit (Hct) of 24% today. No obvious bleeding is present. The patient's MELD score is 45, and they are not a transplant candidate. 

The patient's medical team plans to continue with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, fosphenytoin for seizures, and daily monitoring of the Hct. The patient's code status is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 43-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) presenting with altered mental status, likely septic shock, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and overall poor prognosis.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, worsening cerebral edema, and infection.
- The patient experienced convulsions, which could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infection, or ischemic causes. Seizures have improved since starting on Keppra and fosphenytoin.
- The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 9.5, likely hepatorenal syndrome. Dialysis was not offered due to the patient's prognosis.
- The patient has anemia with a stable Hct (hematocrit) level of 24%.
- The patient has ESLD with a MELD score of 45 and is currently not a transplant candidate.
- The patient's electrolytes are being monitored and repleted as needed. TPN (total parenteral nutrition) is being administered.
- Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots, bowel regimen, and PPI (proton pump inhibitor).
- The patient has an IJ (internal jugular) line and a DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate) code status.
- The patient's family has been informed and a family meeting will be held tomorrow.
- The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving appropriate care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status/Cerebral Edema: The patient's altered mental status and worsening cerebral edema pose a significant risk of neurological decline or persistent vegetative state.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's WBC count is trending down, the presence of sepsis still carries a risk of further organ dysfunction and potential mortality.
3. Convulsions: The patient's seizures could be secondary to multiple factors such as hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infection, or ischemic causes. Continued seizure activity may lead to further neurological damage.
4. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure/Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's worsening renal function, indicated by the increasing creatinine level, may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
5. Anemia: The patient's stable Hct level indicates ongoing monitoring and management of anemia to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
6. ESLD/ETOH Cirrhosis: The patient's ESLD with a MELD score of 45 indicates a high risk of complications and poor prognosis. Liver transplantation may be considered if the patient becomes a suitable candidate.
7. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to ESLD, increasing the risk of infections, including bacterial, viral"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels and minimal urine output. This may be due to hepatorenal syndrome, a condition commonly seen in patients with advanced liver disease.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation in the ICU, indicating respiratory failure. The cause of this failure is not specified as ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), but further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has evidence of liver dysfunction, likely secondary to ESLD. This is indicated by abnormal liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin levels and liver enzymes such as AST and ALT.

4. Altered Mental Status/Cerebral Edema: The patient is experiencing altered mental status and has developed whole brain edema. This could be due to hepatic encephalopathy or cerebral edema, and it is associated with a poor prognosis.

5. Sepsis: The patient had a previous pneumonia and received antibiotic treatment. Although his blood pressure has improved and he no longer requires pressors, there is still a concern for ongoing infection.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition is critical, with multiple complications and poor prognosis.

1. Altered Mental Status/Cerebral Edema: The patient has altered mental status and whole brain edema. The cause is likely multifactorial, including hepatic encephalopathy, worsening cerebral edema, or infection. Lactulose was discontinued due to the lack of reversal of encephalopathy.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count that is trending down, indicating a potential improvement in infection. However, the patient remains hypotensive and requires vasopressors. Antibiotic courses for prior pneumonia have been completed.

3. Convulsions: The patient experiences seizures, primarily on the right side of the face accompanied by right-sided nystagmus. These seizures could be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infection (meningitis), or ischemic causes. The patient is currently receiving Keppra 500IV and fosphenytoin 100mg Q12h. It is recommended to continue fosphenytoin and monitor phenytoin levels with a goal of 10-13 mcg/mL. Fosphenytoin should be continued, and the neurology team should be followed up"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and altered mental status, who is likely experiencing septic shock.
- The patient has a history of ethanol cirrhosis and ESLD, with a MELD score of 45, making him an unsuitable candidate for transplantation at this time.
- The patient's condition includes ineffective coping, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and liver function abnormalities.
- The patient's prognosis is poor, with potential complications such as altered mental status/cerebral edema, convulsions, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure (likely hepatorenal syndrome).
- The patient has been prescribed various medications including lactulose, fosphenytoin, Keppra, and midodrine, among others.
- The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are provided in the progress note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status/Cerebral Edema: The patient may continue to experience altered mental status and cerebral edema due to hepatic encephalopathy, worsening cerebral edema, or infection. This can lead to persistent vegetative state or coma.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's WBC count is trending down, there is still a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is necessary.
3. Convulsions: The patient has experienced seizures,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) and altered mental status, likely experiencing septic shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and overall poor prognosis. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status/cerebral edema, convulsions, acute on chronic renal failure (hepatorenal syndrome), anemia, ETOH (Ethanol) cirrhosis/ESLD, and FEN (not specified). The patient's current treatment plan includes medications such as Reglan, morphine sulfate, fosphenytoin, and pantoprazole. The patient is intubated and sedated, with clear lungs anteriorly but distended and tense abdomen. The patient also has bilateral leg edema and unresponsive neurologic status. The patient's lab results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, TCO2, glucose levels, liver enzymes, and electrolytes. The patient's prognosis is poor, and they have been placed on DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate) status."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including altered mental status, whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, septic shock, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/43-111/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, indicating renal dysfunction. Liver function tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. The patient also has deranged electrolytes, including low sodium and potassium levels.

The patient's condition is described as poor prognosis, with altered mental status likely due to multifactorial causes including hepatic encephalopathy, worsening cerebral edema, and possible infection. The patient is currently on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, Keppra for seizures, and fosphenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with worsening creatinine levels despite being on octreotide and midodrine. Hepatorenal syndrome is suspected, and the patient is not offered dialysis due to their prognosis.

The patient also has anemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal
   syndrome, with overall poor prognosis.
   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: likely multifactorial including
   hepatic encephalopathy, worsening cerebral edema, vs infection: no
   chance of neurologic recovery better than persistent vegetative state
   - lactulose d/c'd (encephalopathy is not going to reverse at this
   point)
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on  Keppra 500IV [**Hospital1 7**],
   fosphenytoin 100mg Q12h.
   - continue fosphenytoin
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr 7.9 -> 9.7; with minimal UOP.
   Likely hepatorenal syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   Not offered dialysis given prognosis.  On octreotide and midodrine but
   creatinine continues to worsen.
   -  Creatinines continuing to worsen; check daily lytes
   # Anemia - Hct stable 24 today.  No obvious bleeding.  Can continue to
   follow daily HCT.
   - daily  Hct
   - Goal Hct > 21
   - Active T&S
   # ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD: patient with MELD score of 45, currently not a
   transplant candidate.
   # FEN: TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots,  bowel regimen, [**Hospital1 7**] PPI
   # Access: IJ
   # Code: DNR/DNI, no further agggressive care indicated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and altered mental status, who is now likely experiencing septic shock. The patient's condition has worsened, with new whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and overall poor prognosis. The patient's altered mental status may be multifactorial, including hepatic encephalopathy, worsening cerebral edema, or infection. The patient's convulsions are improving since starting on Keppra and fosphenytoin. The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome, supported by urine electrolytes with UNa < 10. The patient is not offered dialysis given the prognosis. The patient has anemia with stable Hct, no obvious bleeding, and can continue to follow daily Hct. The patient has ESLD secondary to ETOH cirrhosis with a MELD score of 45, currently not a transplant candidate. The patient requires TPN, prophylaxis for pneumoboots, bowel regimen, and PPI. The patient has an IJ line, DNR/DNI code status, and no further aggressive care indicated. The patient's family has been informed about the situation."

    # Acute on chronic renal failure:
   - creat rising - 10.1 today
   -minimal UOP
   -presumed HRS
   #Anemia
   -hct slowly trending down
   -consider transfusion if falls further depending on level of
   aggressiveness desired going forward

The patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), sepsis, and cerebral edema. He is unresponsive and in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/43-91/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, distended abdomen, cool skin, and sedation. Neurological examination shows no attentiveness, no follow-up of commands, and non-assessment of movement or tone. Lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, abnormal renal function tests, elevated white blood cell count, and electrolyte imbalances.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is currently experiencing altered mental status, likely septic shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and an overall poor prognosis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications including acute pain, ineffective coping, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, and liver function abnormalities.

The patient has a history of ESLD associated with alcohol use disorder and has a MELD score of 45, making him not a transplant candidate. The patient's current treatment plan includes providing comfort care, withdrawing all medications apart from antiepileptics and lactulose, discontinuing blood tests as no added care would be provided, and involving social work and palliative care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and treatment plan include further deterioration of mental status and neurological function, worsening of liver function and hepatorenal syndrome, increased risk of infections due to immunosuppression, and potential complications related to the administration of antiepileptic medications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, neurologic status, liver and kidney function, and overall comfort level to ensure that the comfort care plan is effectively managing the patient's symptoms and providing appropriate support for the patient and the family."

 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
   43 yom with ESLD a/w with altered mental status and now likely septic
   shock, reduced mental status, new whole brain edema, hepatorenal
   syndrome, with overall poor prognosis.
   # Altered Mental Status/Cerebral edema: likely multifactorial including
   hepatic encephalopathy, worsening cerebral edema, vs infection: no
   chance of neurologic recovery better than persistent vegetative state
   - lactulose d/c'd (encephalopathy is not going to reverse at this
   point)
   # Convulsions -  Most prominent in right side of face accompanied by
   right sided nystagmus of the eyes, at times evolving downward to
   include right upper extremity and right lower extremity in Jacksonian
   [**Month (only) **] type pattern.  Seizures could be secondary to overlying hepatic
   encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/ uremia, infectious (meningitis),
   ischemic.  Seizures have improved since started on  Keppra 500IV [**Hospital1 7**],
   fosphenytoin 100mg Q12h.
   - continue fosphenytoin
   - Ativan PRN convulsions (use in caution)
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr 7.9 -> 9.7; with minimal UOP.
   Likely hepatorenal syndrome, supported by urine lytes with UNa < 10.
   Not offered dialysis given prognosis.  On octreotide and midodrine but
   creatinine continues to worsen.
   -  Creatinines continuing to worsen; check daily lytes
   # Anemia - Hct stable 24 today.  No obvious bleeding.  Can continue to
   follow daily HCT.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who presents with altered mental status, likely septic shock, whole brain edema, hepatorenal syndrome, and overall poor prognosis. The patient's condition includes acute pain, ineffective coping, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and liver function abnormalities.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Altered mental status/cerebral edema: This is likely multifactorial, including hepatic encephalopathy, worsening cerebral edema, versus infection. The patient has been given lactulose to address encephalopathy, but it is not expected to reverse at this point.
2. Convulsions: These are characterized by seizures that could be secondary to underlying hepatic encephalopathy, renal encephalopathy/uremia, infection (meningitis), or ischemic causes. The patient has been started on Keppra 500IV and fosphenytoin 100mg Q12h, and it is recommended to continue fosphenytoin and use Ativan PRN for convulsions.
3. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have worsened from 7.9 to 9.7, with minimal urine output. This is likely hepatorenal syndrome, supported by urine electrolytes with UNa < 10. Dialysis is not offered due to the"
