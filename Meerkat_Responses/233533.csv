","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to chronic kidney disease. She presented to the hospital with high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and acute renal failure. 

The patient has been paced at 70 bpm and is hemodynamically stable. The cause of the block is unclear, but it may be related to calcified aortic stenosis and mitral annular calcification. Other possible causes such as hyperkalemia, myocarditis, or medication overdose have been ruled out.

The patient is also experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated, suggesting a possible infection. However, no clear source of infection has been identified. Given her immunocompromised state and history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection (UTI), she has been empirically treated with meropenem and vancomycin. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause of her symptoms.

Other ongoing concerns include acute on chronic renal failure, which may be due to rejection/acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her creatinine level is elevated, and she is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation improved to mild MR on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post liver and kidney transplantation.

The patient presented to the hospital with high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and acute renal failure. She has been diagnosed with complete heart block and is currently being paced at 70 beats per minute. The cause of the block is unclear, but possible contributing factors include calcified aortic stenosis and mitral annular calcification. The patient's hyperkalemia can also potentially cause AV block, although her serum potassium level is not above 6.3.

The patient is also experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. No recent antibiotic use has been reported, but her immunocompromised state increases the likelihood of infection. She has a history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection (UTI) in the past. Empirically, she is being treated with meropenem and vancomycin.

Her recent labs show a white"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation improved to mild MR on TEE, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and end-stage renal disease who underwent liver and kidney transplantation 7 months ago. The patient presented to Hospital1 with high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular block and acute renal failure. The patient had a syncopal episode and was found to have a heart rate of 20-30's at OSH. A transvenous pacemaker was placed, and the patient is being paced at 70 beats per minute. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, but the cause of the block is unclear. The patient has calcified aortic stenosis and mitral annular calcification that could contribute to AV block. There is no evidence of myocarditis or overdose, and hyperkalemia can cause AV block but usually requires serum K levels > 6.3.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications:
   - High-degree 2:1 atrioventricular block
   - Calcified aortic stenosis and mitral annular calcification
   - Myocarditis
   - Overdose

2. Renal Complications:

- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, dilated cardiomyopathy, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation improved to mild MR on TEE, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post liver and kidney transplantation.
- The patient presented to Hospital1 with high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and acute renal failure.
- The patient has been paced at 70 beats per minute and is hemodynamically stable. The cause of the block is unclear, but there is no evidence of acute myocarditis or overdose. Calcified aortic stenosis and mitral annular calcification could contribute to AV block. Hyperkalemia can also cause AV block, but usually serum potassium needs to be > 6.3.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.1, slight improvement. Lactate is 2.2, and the patient is afebrile but had a temperature of 100.0 on admission.

The cause of the block is unclear, but potential causes include calcified aortic stenosis and mitral annular calcification, as well as hyperkalemia. The patient's serum potassium level is currently normal, so this is less likely to be the cause.

The patient also has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with baseline creatinine levels of 0.8-1.2.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, dilated cardiomyopathy, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation improved to mild MR on TEE, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and end-stage renal disease status post liver and kidney transplant. The patient presented to the hospital with high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and acute renal failure. She was found to have a syncopal episode and had a transvenous pacemaker placed at the other hospital (OSH), which is being paced at 70 beats per minute. The patient is hemodynamically stable, but the etiology of the high-degree AV block is unclear.

The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.3, fever, and an elevated creatinine level of 2.3. The urine culture at OSH showed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) klebsiella, and the patient complains of suprapubic abdominal discomfort. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed no new abdominal or pelvic fluid, but there is gas within the collecting system of the transplant kidney, likely due to refluxed air from the urinary bladder rather than infection.

The patient has a history of splenic vein thromb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent liver and kidney transplantation. She presented to the hospital with a high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular block and acute renal failure. The patient has been in the ICU since then and has had several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and her current rhythm is ventricular-paced. She is being monitored on telemetry and will continue with the transvenous pacer. It is recommended to hold Coreg (metoprolol succinate) and perform an electrophysiology study (EP study). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is also suggested.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 0.8-1.2, but it improved to 1.2. It is less likely to be rejection or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given the rapid improvement. Overdiuresis is the most likely cause. The differential diagnosis includes no evidence of thrombosis, possible infection, and obstructive uropathy. Tacrol"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone liver and kidney transplantation. The patient presented to the hospital with high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and acute renal failure.

The patient was found to have a syncopal episode and was discovered to have a heart rate of 20-30 bpm at the outside hospital (OSH). She was likely experiencing a high-degree 2:1 AV block or complete heart block. A transvenous pacemaker was placed at the OSH, and she is being paced at 70 bpm. The patient is hemodynamically stable, but the cause of the block remains unclear. Coronary artery disease has been ruled out, and there is no evidence of acute myocarditis.

The patient's electrolytes show hyperkalemia, which can potentially cause AV block. However, the serum potassium levels are below the typical threshold for this effect. Calcified aortic stenosis and mitral annular calcification could contribute to AV block. No evidence of thrombosis or infection is observed, so the cause of acute renal failure is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient's chief complaint is abdominal pain, along with a fever of 101.6°F. The CT abdomen/pelvis showed no obvious cause for the abdominal pain but revealed air in the bladder and kidney, likely due to a Foley catheter. The patient's renal input/output goals were set, and diuretics and ACE inhibitors were held. The patient also has a history of constipation, and bowel regimen was increased. Hematuria was noted, and the patient had a bowel movement without relief in pain. The patient uses CPAP at home for OSA, and a respiratory consult was requested.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of fever, along with potential urinary tract infection indicated by hematuria, may suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal input/output goals and the presence of air in the bladder and kidney raise concerns about potential kidney injury.
3. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation and increased bowel regimen indicate the need for careful monitoring to prevent complications related to constipation.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF), moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) improved to mild MR on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post liver and kidney transplant. The patient presented to the hospital with a high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition includes being paced at 70 due to a syncopal episode and a suspected high-degree 2:1 AV block. The cause of the block is unclear, but the patient has calcifications in the aortic valve and mitral annulus that could contribute to AV block. There is also evidence of hyperkalemia, which can cause AV block, but serum potassium levels are not significantly elevated.

The patient's renal function has improved from baseline post-transplant of 0.8-1.2 to 1.2, making rejection or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) less likely. The most probable cause of the elevated creatinine is overdiuresis. The differential diagnosis includes no evidence of thrombosis, possible infection,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, dilated cardiomyopathy, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and end-stage renal disease who presented with high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular block and acute renal failure. She underwent transvenous pacing at the outside hospital and is currently being paced at 70 beats per minute. The etiology of the atrioventricular block is unclear but most likely due to calcification of the AV and mitral valves. Other possible etiologies include Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, excessive AV nodal blockade, or endocarditis, although these are less likely. The patient has a history of kidney transplant six months ago with baseline creatinine levels of 0.8-1.2, which improved to 1.2 and is likely not due to rejection or acute tubular necrosis. Overdiuresis is the most probable cause. The patient is immunocompromised and at risk of opportunistic infections. She also has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.3 and fever, along with suprapubic abdominal discomfort. Urine culture at the outside hospital showed ESBL klebsiella. The patient's electrolytes are stable, and she has a slightly elevated lactate level of 2"

   peristalsis/focal collapse. However, correlation is advised to
   determine if
   there are epigastric clinical symptoms.
   4. Stable right adrenal mass most likely representing a myelolipoma.
   5. Left adnexal cyst, unchanged since prior CT.

   CXR ([**2-4**]):
   There is no pneumothorax. Right internal jugular approach transvenous
   pacing
   wire is unchanged in position, tip probably in the region of the

   sinus. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Small right pleural
   effusion
   and associated right basilar atelectasis is unchanged. There is new
   minimal
   left basilar atelectasis as well.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, dilated cardiomyopathy (improved from moderate-severe to mild mitral regurgitation after transplant), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post liver and kidney transplantation. She presented to the hospital with a high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and acute renal failure.

The patient's current medical conditions and interventions include:

1. Rhythm: The patient experienced a syncopal episode and was found to have a heart rate of 20-30 beats per minute. She is being paced at 70 beats per minute due to a transvenous pacemaker placed at the outside hospital (OSH). The etiology of the high-degree 2:1 AV block is unclear but is likely due to AV and mitral valve calcification. Lyme serology is negative, and other etiologies such as sarcoidosis, excess AV nodal blockade, or endocarditis are unlikely. The patient is unable to tolerate being off the pacemaker, so an electrophysiology (EP) study and pacemaker placement have been recommended.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level after kidney transplant was 0"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, dilated cardiomyopathy, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation improved to mild MR on TEE, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post liver and kidney transplant. She presented to the hospital with high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and acute renal failure.

The patient underwent a pacemaker placement yesterday and is currently in the ICU for monitoring. She has been experiencing suprapubic abdominal discomfort and is found to have an ESBL Klebsiella infection in her urine culture. Her leukocyte count is trending down. The source of infection is likely the Foley catheter, which is causing chronic bladder spasm and abdominal pain.

The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 10.3 g/dL, likely due to hematuria from the Foley catheter. Her hematocrit is trending down, and she requires transfusion if it falls below 21%. The Foley catheter should be removed if she is not passing clots, as it is worsening her abdominal pain.

The patient has chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine level of 0.8-1.2. Her current creatinine level is 2.3"

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and end-stage renal disease who presented to the hospital with high-degree 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and acute renal failure. She underwent pacemaker placement yesterday and tolerated the procedure well.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.8-1.2, which improved to 1.2. This improvement suggests that the cause of renal failure is not rejection or acute tubular necrosis but more likely overdiuresis. The differential diagnosis includes no evidence of thrombosis, possible infection, or obstructive causes. The plan includes checking tacrolimus levels and adjusting dosing, continuing prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil, and monitoring electrolytes.

2. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be due to chronic bladder spasm, possibly exacerbated by a urinary tract infection. The plan includes a urology outpatient follow-up appointment in three weeks and continuing oxycodone for pain control.

3. Anemia/Down-trending Hematocrit (Hct): The patient has hematuria, likely traumatic"
