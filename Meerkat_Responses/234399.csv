   Chief Complaint
   Over the past 24 hours, there  was a dramatic change in mental status
   from somnolent to agitated and paranoid.  Respiratory status improved
   significantly as the patient is not satting over 95% on RA.  The
   patient has been extremely paranoid all night, thinking that ""everyone
   is trying to kill her"" constantly screaming, in soft restraints x2.
   She was tring to pull the lines.   Re-started patient
s Abilify and
   Risperidal, which were held perio-operatively.  The patient aslo got
   total 1.75mg Haldol O/N for agitation.  Oxybutinin was held due for
   anti-chol effects and concerns for delirium.
   Lovenox was discontinued per Heme recs due to poor renal function and
   the pt. was started on IV Heparin for anticoagulation bridge to
   Coumadin for post-operative prophylaxis x 3 weeks with INR goal
   1.8-2.2.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of dementia, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage III, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She was admitted for an elective left total knee replacement but was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing dramatic changes in mental status over the past 24 hours, transitioning from somnolent to agitated and paranoid. She is currently on soft restraints and receiving antipsychotic medications such as Abilify, Risperdal, and Haldol. Her respiratory status has improved significantly, with oxygen saturation above 95%. The patient has also been receiving IV heparin for anticoagulation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which was most likely due to opioids. She received Narcan but still requires close monitoring for any respiratory distress or hypoxia.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, ranging from somnolent to agitated and paranoid. It is essential to continue monitoring her cognitive function and address any potential causes such as medication side effects or metabolic imbalances.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 135 mEq/L. This could be related to her history of diabetes insipidus secondary to lithium"

   significantly as the patient is not satting over 95% on RA.  The
   patient has been extremely paranoid all night, thinking that ""everyone
   is trying to kill her"" constantly screaming, in soft restraints x2.
   She was tring to pull the lines.   Re-started patient
s Abilify and
   Risperidal, which were held perio-operatively.  The patient aslo got
   total 1.75mg Haldol O/N for agitation.  Oxybutinin was held due for
   anti-chol effects and concerns for delirium.
   Lovenox was discontinued per Heme recs due to poor renal function and
   the pt. was started on IV Heparin for anticoagulation bridge to
   Coumadin for post-operative prophylaxis x 3 weeks with INR goal
   1.8-2.2.

   Assessment and Plan
   73y/o with Dementia, Parkinsons, Schizophrenia vs Schizo-affective
   disorder, HTN CKD III, h/o DVT admitted [**9-16**] for elective left total
   knee replacement.  Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] due to somnolence and acute
   respiratory failure, which has since resolved.
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure: Resolved, currently satting well on RA,
   breathing without any labor.
   - F/u ABG now that the respiratory failure has resolved to assure
   resolved hypercarbia.
   - Encourage incentive spirometry
   - Oxygen NC as needed
   .
   #  Agitation:  Pt. currently agitated, likely a combination of baseline
   dementia and Schizophrenia, with held antipsychotic meds, and delirium
   (post-operative vs. UTI). The patient is currently refusing to take her
   PO meds.  Since delirium may have been precipitated by UTI, will start
   treatment for complicated UTI in this elderly woman with IV Ceftriaxone
   for 7 days.  Will not use Cipro due to high risk of QTc prolongation.
   - Low dose Ulltram for pain control
   - Appreciate psych recs
   - Zyprexa IM standing and PRN for agitation
   - F/u EKG QTc
   - Restart home antipsychotic meds as soon as possible
   - IV Ceftriaxone for UTI
   - F/u Urine Culture
   .
   # Left knee replacement: dressing changed today
   - f/u ortho recs
   - CPM 0-60
   -Transfuse 1 units pRBC with IV access
   .
   # Dementia/MDD/Parkinsons:
   - restart home meds when the patient
s agitation has resolved
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  History of DI secondary to Lithium.  Hypernatremia
   has resolved.
   - Continue to trend Na
   - Switch IVF to D51/2NS at 75 cc/hr
   .
   # ? Afib/HTN/history of PE:  Currently in sinus rhythm, but
   hypertensive
   - Use IV Hydralazine PRN to control blood pressure while the pt. is
   refusing PO meds.
   - Continue anticoagulation with coumadin with INR goal 1.8-2.2 for 3
   weeks post-operatively.  D/c IV Heparin at this point as the patient is
   therapeutic on Coumadin.
   -Re-start home Lisinopril and Metoprolol whenever the patient is
   accepting PO meds.
   .
   # CKD:  Recent Cr baseline 1.9.  Continues to slowly trend up to 2.7.
   Will check urine lytes to determine etiology and re-check kidney
   function in PM.
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins/trend

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of dementia, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage III, and a history of deep vein thrombosis. She was admitted on [9-16] for an elective left total knee replacement. She was transferred to the ICU due to somnolence and acute respiratory failure, which has since resolved. The patient currently has agitation, likely due to a combination of her baseline dementia and schizophrenia, as well as possible post-operative delirium or urinary tract infection. She is refusing to take her oral medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation: The patient is currently agitated, which could be due to her underlying conditions such as dementia and schizophrenia, as well as possible post-operative delirium or urinary tract infection. She is at risk for falls or injury due to her agitated state.
2. Delirium: The patient may be experiencing delirium, which is characterized by an acute change in mental status. It is important to identify and treat any underlying causes, such as infection or medication side effects.
3. Respiratory failure: Although the patient's acute respiratory failure has resolved, she may still be at risk for further respiratory complications, especially if she continues to refuse incentive spirometry or oxygen therapy.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is being treated for a complicated UTI, which is a common infection"

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of dementia, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia vs schizo-affective disorder, hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage III, and a history of deep vein thrombosis. She was admitted for an elective left total knee replacement but was transferred to the ICU due to altered mental status and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing paranoia, agitation, and pulling at her lines. She has a full code status and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which could be due to opioids. She received Narcan but still requires assistance with breathing. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and ABG results is necessary. Further investigations such as a chest X-ray or CT pulmonary embolism should be considered to rule out other causes of respiratory distress.

2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient exhibits signs of AMS, which may be related to her dementia, medication effects, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying conditions. It is crucial to avoid narcotics that may worsen her respiratory status and to trend her sodium levels due to a history of diabetes insipidus secondary to lithium. Frequent reassessment of her mental status and hydration status is essential.

3. Left Knee Replacement: The patient was admitted for an elective left total knee replacement. It is important to follow the recommendations of the orthopedic team regarding her postoperative"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status. They have a history of psychosis and are currently experiencing agitation, paranoia, and refusing all oral medications. The patient has a background of chronic respiratory failure, and there are concerns about possible aspiration pneumonia. They also have hypernatremia, renal insufficiency, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is currently on multiple medications including narcotics, haloperidol, and possibly zyprexa for psychiatric evaluation. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and requires nutritional support. The patient's condition is critical, and they have a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure could worsen due to factors such as narcotics-induced hypoventilation, aspiration pneumonia, or thromboembolic disease.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient is at risk for hypoxemia due to hypoventilation, aspiration pneumonia, or thromboembolic disease.
3. Psychosis: The patient's underlying psychiatric disease may worsen, potentially leading to further delirium or psychosis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia needs close monitoring and management to avoid complications such as seizures or neurological damage.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency should be managed carefully to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE --  Acute on chronic failure.  Improved.
   attributed to narcotics, atalectasis on background of chronic lung
   disease.  Need to consider possibility of aspiration pneumonitis.
   Monitor RR, SaO2, ABG as indicated.  Use BiPAP as indicated to maintain
   ventilation.
   HYPOXEMIA --  attributed to hypoventilation.  Need to consider
   thromboembolic disease.  Check LENIVS once dressing removed.  Monitor
   SaO2, maintain 89-92%.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 attributed to medications (narcotics) and
   hypercapnia.
   PSYCHOSIS
 Marked worsening overnight.  Underlying Psychiatric disease
   (off medications), although at risk for post-operative delerium, ICU
   psychosis.  Psychiatry Evaluation in progress.  Using prn Haldol for
   management, prn zyprexa as per Psychiatry.  Hopefully will improve with
   reinstitution of usual medications.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic.  Provide iv maintenance fluid.
   HYPERNATREMIA
 free water deficit.  Improved with free water
   repletion, monitor Na, goal to <148.
   RENAL INSUFFICIENCY
 chronic, baseline creatinine.
   LEFT TKR -- Orthopedics Team to follow.  Monitor for bleeding.
   Optimize pain regimen.  Per Hematology and Ortho, continue coumadin
   (may need heparin if unable to take PO and PT INR falls below goal
   1.8-2.0) for DVT prophylaxis in post-op period.
   h/o DVT, RECURRENT

   Assessment and Plan
   73y/o with Dementia, Parkinsons, Schizophrenia vs Schizo-affective
   disorder, HTN CKD III, h/o DVT admitted [**9-16**] for elective left total
   knee replacement.  Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] due to somnolence and acute
   respiratory failure, which has since resolved.
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure: Resolved, currently satting well on RA,
   breathing without any labor.
   - F/u ABG now that the respiratory failure has resolved to assure
   resolved hypercarbia.
   - Encourage incentive spirometry
   - Oxygen NC as needed
   .
   #  Agitation:  Pt. currently agitated, likely a combination of baseline
   dementia and Schizophrenia, with held antipsychotic meds, and delirium
   (post-operative vs. UTI). The patient is currently refusing to take her
   PO meds.  Since delirium may have been precipitated by UTI, will start
   treatment for complicated UTI in this elderly woman with IV Ceftriaxone
   for 7 days.  Will not use Cipro due to high risk of QTc prolongation.
   - Low dose Ulltram for pain control
   - Appreciate psych recs
   - Zyprexa IM standing and PRN for agitation
   - F/u EKG QTc
   - Restart home antipsychotic meds as soon as possible
   - IV Ceftriaxone for UTI
   - F/u Urine Culture
   .
   # Left knee replacement: dressing changed today
   - f/u ortho recs
   - CPM 0-60
   -Transfuse 1 units pRBC with IV access
   .
   # Dementia/MDD/Parkinsons:
   - restart home meds when the patient
s agitation has resolved
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  History of DI secondary to Lithium.  Hypernatremia
   has resolved.
   - Continue to trend Na
   - Switch IVF to D51/2NS at 75 cc/hr
   .
   # ? Afib/HTN/history of PE:  Currently in sinus rhythm, but
   hypertensive
   - Use IV Hydralazine PRN to control blood pressure while the pt. is
   refusing PO meds.
   - Continue anticoagulation with coumadin with INR goal 1.8-2.2 for 3
   weeks post-operatively.  D/c IV Heparin at this point as the patient is
   therapeutic on Coumadin.
   -Re-start home Lisinopril and Metoprolol whenever the patient is
   accepting PO meds.
   .
   # CKD:  Recent Cr baseline 1.9.  Continues to slowly trend up to 2.7.
   Will check urine lytes to determine etiology and re-check kidney
   function in PM.
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins/trend

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old with a medical history of dementia, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia vs schizo-affective disorder, hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage III, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and diabetes insipidus secondary to lithium. The patient was admitted on [**9-16**] for an elective left total knee replacement and later transferred to the ICU due to somnolence and acute respiratory failure, which has since resolved.

The patient is currently agitated and experiencing hypercarbia, likely due to baseline dementia and schizophrenia, as well as post-operative delirium and a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is refusing to take oral medications. Therefore, treatment for complicated UTI has been initiated with IV Ceftriaxone for 7 days, avoiding Cipro due to its high risk of QTc prolongation. Low-dose Ultram has been prescribed for pain control, and Zyprexa IM standing and PRN has been ordered for agitation. An electrocardiogram (EKG) is needed to monitor the QTc interval.

The patient's left knee replacement dressing has been changed, and continuous passive motion (CPM) has been recommended. Additionally, a blood transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (pRBC) is needed with IV access.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition has shown improvement in several areas. The respiratory status has improved, with no signs of respiratory failure. Psychosis has also improved, and the patient is better controlled. Agitation has improved, and the patient is more cooperative. Blood pressure is also better controlled.

However, there are still some potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient still requires consideration for thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of their hypoxemia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen levels is necessary.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is attributed to medications (narcotics) and hypercapnia. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust medication dosages accordingly.

3. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent both underhydration and overhydration. The goal is to maintain euvolemia.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have improved but should still be monitored. Free water repletion has been initiated, and the goal is to maintain a sodium level below 148.

5. Renal Insufficiency: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, and baseline creatinine levels should be regularly monitored.

6. Left Total Knee Replacement (TKR): The patient's left TKR requires close monitoring for any signs of bleeding or infection. Pain management should be optimized, and the orthopedic team will follow"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of psychosis. The patient's respiratory status has improved and is no longer experiencing respiratory failure. Psychosis has also improved significantly. The patient is more cooperative and taking all oral medications as prescribed.

The patient's blood pressure has improved as well. The review of systems shows no abnormalities in any of the major organ systems. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of overweight or obesity. The patient's cardiovascular examination is unremarkable with normal heart rhythm.

The patient's extremities show trace edema in the right lower extremity and 2+ edema in the left lower extremity, but there is no cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination indicates that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. There are no abnormal findings in terms of muscle tone or strength.

Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal limits. The creatinine level is slightly elevated, indicating some degree of renal insufficiency. Other lab values such as glucose, potassium, sodium, and calcium are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include the following:
- Respiratory failure: Improved but practice cautious use of narcotics.
- Hypoxemia: Attributed to hypoventilation, need to consider thromboembolic disease. Excellent ABG.
- Altered mental status: Attrib"
