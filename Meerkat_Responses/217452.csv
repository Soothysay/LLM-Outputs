   Assessment and Plan
   44 yoF with recent diagnosis of probable SCLCA, s/p brain bx, now
   planned for WBR, transferred for close neurologic monitoring in setting
   of initiation of XRT.
   .
   #. Lung/CNS/adrenal/renal lesions: In setting of patient's
   constitutional symptoms, smoking history and weight loss, these
   findings are highly suspicious for primarily lung cancer with wide
   metastatic spread. An infectious etiology is also possible, but much
   less likely given lack of fevers, normal WBC at time of admission,
   negative culture data to date.
   -s/p brain bx; follow-up results
   -WBR planned for later today; will need q1 hour neuro checks after
   wards
   -oncology consult
   -neuro/neuro oncology to follow
   -continue dexamethasone for now, transitioning to PO
   -continue Keppra
   .
   #. Elevated blood pressure: Pt without diagnosis of HTN, but with
   elevated blood pressures since admission. Started on hydralazine
   several days ago. Reasonable to continue this for now while trending
   BPs, however would likely transition to a better long term medication
   (such as an ACEi or CCB) at discharge.
   .
   #. Elevated blood sugars: Blood sugars in the low to mid 100s since
   initiations of steroids, which are likely a major contributing factor.
   -continue ISS
   -continue to trend
   .
   #. Nausea/vomiting: Have now resolved. Likely related to metastatic CNS
   disease. Will monitor closely.
   .
   #. Asthma: No currently an active issue. Continue to monitor lung exam.
   .
   #. Anemia: Normocytic, normal RDW. Fe studies from [**2184-5-25**] essentially
   normal. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to malignancy versus menstrual status. Continue

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of probable small cell lung cancer (SCLC). She underwent a brain biopsy and is planned for whole brain radiation therapy (WBR). The patient was transferred to the ICU for close neurological monitoring during the initiation of radiation therapy.

The patient has lung, CNS, and renal lesions, which are highly suspicious for primarily lung cancer with wide metastatic spread. She is currently being treated with dexamethasone for possible metastatic CNS disease and Keppra for seizures.

The patient also has elevated blood pressure despite not having a known history of hypertension. She was started on hydralazine, and it is reasonable to continue this medication for now while trending blood pressures. A better long-term medication (such as an ACE inhibitor or calcium channel blocker) may be considered at discharge.

Additionally, the patient has elevated blood sugars in the low to mid 100s since the initiation of steroids, which are likely a major contributing factor. It is recommended to continue intravenous insulin (ISS) and closely monitor blood sugar levels.

The patient's nausea and vomiting have now resolved, but this may be related to metastatic CNS disease. Her asthma is currently not an active issue, and it is important to continue monitoring the lung exam.

The patient's anemia is normocytic with a normal RDW, and fe studies from [**2184-5-25**] were essentially normal. It"
