 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH)
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   55 yo man with large intracranial hemmorhage - R thalamic,
   intraventricular bleed with midline shift.  It appears that he was down
   at home for some time given the pressure ulcers on his L side.  His
   prognosis is very poor in light of timecourse, severity of bleed, and
   poor neuro exam.  Appreciate neurosurgical and neurology input - agree
   that any neurological intervention at this time would not change the
   outcome for this unfortunate gentleman.
   1. ICH: Cont to monitor BP to keep MAP < 110.  Do not overcorrect
   sodium to quickly.  Keep pCO2 in low 30s if possible
   2. Hypernatremia: Check frequently, correct only slowly.
   3. Acute Renal Failure: Cont to montior
   4. Respiratory Failure: Cont current vent settings
   5. GI Bleed: Trend Hcts
   Will need to confirm his identity definitively so we can address goals
   of care.  Have consulted social work.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man with a large intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), specifically in the right thalamus with intraventricular bleed and midline shift. He also has hyperglycemia and impaired skin integrity. The patient's prognosis is very poor due to the severity of the bleed, poor neurologic examination, and prolonged time course.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The presence of an intracranial hemorrhage can lead to increased ICP, which can further compromise cerebral perfusion and potentially result in herniation.

2. Seizures: Intracranial hemorrhages can trigger seizures due to the disruption of brain tissue and the release of excitatory neurotransmitters.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, but there is a risk of developing hyponatremia if the sodium levels are corrected too quickly.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest impaired renal function, which may be due to decreased perfusion or the effects of the hemorrhage.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation to support his respiratory function. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory infection due to prolonged intubation.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present, and now with
   maroon stool overnight. BUN elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated
   secondary to dehydration. Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown
   past medical history is broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**]
   tear, lower GI bleed, diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's (q6 hr)
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - replace free water (D5 at 200cc/h) as well as through TF flushes
   - q6h lytes
   - recheck urine lytes, ? evolving additional DI etiology
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Consider surgery c/s for debridement pending family discussion
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown medical history who was found unresponsive and brought to the ICU. The patient has several significant conditions, including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and possible NSTEMI/Troponin leak.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, and concerns for herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurological deterioration and further bleeding are potential complications.
2. Respiratory failure: Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to the patient's underlying lung condition and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and there is a risk of worsening renal failure. Fluid management and careful monitoring of electrolyte levels are crucial to prevent further renal damage.
4. Hypothermia: The patient is at risk of developing hypothermia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and multiorgan dysfunction.
5. GI bleeding: Continued bleeding and the need for endoscopic interventions or surgery to identify and manage the source of bleeding are potential complications.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need careful management"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift. Concerns in the
   setting of IPH include herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm.
   Neurology and neurosurgery saw the patient in the emergency room and
   did not recommend interventions. Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is
   difficult to interpret.  He had some response to pain yesterday,
   although this morning, off propofol he is not responding.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1 hours
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - repeat head CT tomorrow in am
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present. BUN
   elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated secondary to dehydration.
   Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown past medical history is
   broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**] tear, lower GI bleed,
   diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   # Hypernatremia: Na 164 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - Slowly replace free water (D5NS at 100cc/h)
   - q4h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - Send urine lytes
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK
   .
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Consider surgery c/s for debridement
   .
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown medical history who was found unresponsive and brought to the ICU. The patient has several medical complications including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis.

The patient has a right thalamic bleed with intraventricular hemorrhage and hydrocephalus, midline shift. There are concerns about herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. The neurologic exam is difficult to interpret due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

The patient was intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure. An ABG showed a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 49, and PaO2 of 510. The chest X-ray is clear. The plan is to decrease FiO2 and wean the ventilator as tolerated.

The patient is also hypothermic, and possible reasons include central hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, which may contribute to the hypothermia.

There is evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the differential includes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, esophageal tear, lower GI bleed, diverticulosis, or arteriovenous malformation. The patient has a high hematocrit level likely due to dehydration.

The patient also has hypernatremia, with a serum sodium level of 164, likely secondary to hypovolemic hypernatremia. The free water deficit is approximately 7.2L.

The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, with an unknown baseline creatinine. Rhabdomyolysis is suspected, contributing to renal failure, and there may also be a component of pre-renal etiology.

The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), indicating rhabdomyolysis. It is likely secondary to being down for an unknown period of time.

There is evidence of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with troponin leak, but the EKG does not show evidence of ST changes.

The patient has sacral ulcers with eschars on the left back and coccyx and heel, suggesting that the patient was down for several days.

The patient's identity needs to be confirmed, and efforts are being made to locate the patient's brother's contact information.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   .
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: Preliminary read of CTA of head
   indicated right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline
   shift. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret due to sedation from propofol
   and paralysis with vecuronium.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - Stop propofol to assess neuro status
   - will not continue the dilantin, as dilantin can interfere with
   platelet function
   - neuro checks q1 hours
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - repeat head CT tomorrow in am
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - stroke consult service recommendations
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Frequent ABG's
   - Place a-line
   .
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR huggers
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   .
   # GI bleeding: Guaiac positive in ED, with oozing present. BUN
   elevated, but hct of 44 is likely elevated secondary to dehydration.
   Differential for GIB in this pt with unknown past medical history is
   broad, including gastritis, PUD, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 241**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37**] tear, lower GI bleed,
   diverticulosis, AVM.
   - Active T+S
   - PPI
   - Serial hct's
   - Consider GI c/s once other issues stabilize if GIB continues
   - Obtain OSH/PCP records once identity established
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na 164 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.
   - Slowly replace free water (1/2NS at 100cc/h)
   - q4h lytes
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - Send urine lytes
   - f/u u/o
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK
   .
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   .
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Wound care c/s
   .
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown medical history who was found unresponsive and brought to the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient is currently sedated and paralyzed, making neurologic examination difficult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift. This can lead to herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret due to sedation from propofol and paralysis with vecuronium.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection/respiratory failure. ABG showed a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 49, and PaO2 of 510. Frequent ABG's, decrease FiO2, place a-line, and check for any signs of improvement or deterioration.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is 35.0 degrees Celsius. Possible reasons for hypothermia include central hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. Use BAIR huggers, check TSH, blood, urine cultures, and maintain BP's.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a large intracranial hemorrhage, specifically in the right thalamus with intraventricular bleed and midline shift. He has been unresponsive and unable to provide any history. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight increase in heart rate. He is on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results show hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated troponin levels. He also has impaired skin integrity with pressure ulcers on his left side.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) - The patient's large intracranial hemorrhage is a critical concern. Monitoring his blood pressure to keep mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 110 mmHg is important to prevent further bleeding.
2. Hypernatremia - The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration and neurological complications. It is crucial to monitor his fluid repletion and correct the sodium levels appropriately.
3. Acute renal failure - The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Respiratory failure - The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation to support his breathing. Adjustments"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal
   - transfuse 2 units hct
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - proctoscopy to evaluate possibility of distal lesion (sugery vs
   proctoscopy)
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   - discuss goals of care w/ family for possible EGD
   - DDVAP for uremic platelets in setting of bleed and possible procedure
   # goals of care
   - family came in yesterday. Brother apparently wants [**Name (NI) 580**], but father
   unsure. Family to return today.
   - must obtain ICU consent
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 on admission likely due to hypovolemic
   hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167.
   Free water deficit is approximately 7.2L.  Na to 150 this AM
   - decrease free water repletion rate to D5 at 75/hr to prevent overly
   rapid correction particularly as hypertonicity may be protective in
   setting of brain bleed
   - no NS for now as getting blood
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely that
   rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding.
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   - Repeat CT head per [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   .
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal
   - Transfuse 2 units hct
   - active t+s
   - GI consult
   - Continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   - discuss goals of care w/ family for possible EGD
   .
   # goals of care
   - family came in yesterday. Brother apparently wants [**Name (NI) 580**], but father
   unsure. Family to return today
   - must obtain ICU consent
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR is clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Hypernatremia: Na 162 likely due to hypovolemic hypernatremia.
   Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. Free water
   deficit is approximately 7.2L.   Na to 150 this AM
   - replace free water (D5 at 200cc/h) as well as through TF flushes
   - q6h lytes
   - recheck urine lytes, ? evolving additional DI etiology
   # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine. Suspect that
   rhabdomyolysis (CK 850) contributing to renal failure, also likely a
   component of prerenal etiology.
   - resend urine lytes as above
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes.
   - Trend CE
   - Serial EKG's
   - Telemetry
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   # Identification: Call pt's father again in am to obtain pt's brother's
   phone number. Father was unable to locate number in the middle of the
   night as he is elderly.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown past medical history. He presents with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Herniation: Due to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage, there is a concern for herniation, especially in the setting of increased intracranial pressure.

2. Hydrocephalus: The presence of hydrocephalus can further increase intracranial pressure and may require intervention.

3. Vasospasm: In the case of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, vasospasm can occur, leading to further ischemia and potential neurological deterioration.

4. GI bleeding: The patient has experienced significant GI bleeding, which may continue or recur, potentially leading to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is suspicion of rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure. Aggressive fluid management and close monitoring of renal function are necessary.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely secondary to hypovolemic hypernatremia. Rapid correction of sodium levels should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to severe pneumonia. The patient's family is still deciding on the goals of care. His sodium levels are being optimized. The patient underwent surgical debridement of wounds with silk sutures placed to control bleeding, which will be removed on [**5-2**]. He experienced bright red blood from the flexiseal and a stat Hct was sent, with 2 units ordered for transfusion. The patient has an infection with gram-negative bacilli in his blood culture.

The patient is receiving various medications including insulin, pantoprazole (Protonix), propofol, fentanyl, and other ICU medications. His allergies include vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/67 to 205/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent bleeding event. His flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of 7,075 mL total in, 2"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has experienced an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with a thalamic bleed and midline shift, hypernatremia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Expansion of the intracranial hemorrhage, leading to increased intracranial pressure and further neurological deterioration.
2. Worsening of hypernatremia, potentially leading to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
3. Rebleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, causing continued blood loss and potential development of coagulopathy.
4. Progression of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney injury and systemic complications.
5. Failure to wean off mechanical ventilation, resulting in prolonged respiratory support and associated risks.
6. Development of pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, leading to wound infections and potential systemic infection.
7. Deterioration of renal function, causing electrolyte disturbances and accumulation of waste products.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition and promptly address any emerging complications to provide the best possible care."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old man with a large intracranial hemorrhage, including a thalamic bleed and intraventricular bleed with midline shift. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypernatremia, gastrointestinal bleed, rhabdomyolysis, ineffective coping, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), hyperglycemia, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.9°C (100.2°F), current temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate (HR) of 101 bpm with a range of 81-102 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 124/67 mmHg to 205/111 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute with a range of 16-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient is mechanically ventilated.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 30.0% to 35.0%, platelet count (Plt) of 294 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 3.2 mg/dL to 4.4 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging"

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

The patient experienced a significant gastrointestinal bleed, indicated by large amounts of bright and dark red blood per rectum. Surgery and GI consulted on the case, and a tagged RBC scan showed active bleeding in the sigmoidal area. The patient was taken for interventional radiology (IR) angio but did not intervene as the patient was actively bleeding. The patient received 2 units of blood transfusion in the morning, with Hct relatively stable at 28-30 on multiple Hct checks. Levophed was started for hypotension and tachycardia around 4 pm, and the patient was notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 pm, a large clot passed per rectum, followed by blood spilling out. Hct was ordered, and the patient received another 2 units of blood. The pressures came up on their own, and the patient is now off pressures.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/83 to 157/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has received various medications including insulin, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and other ICU medications. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations.
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday, IR
   felt unable to intervene on clot
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
   # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - decrease free water repletion rate to D5 at 75/hr to prevent overly
   rapid correction particularly as hypertonicity may be protective in
   setting of brain bleed
   - no NS for now as getting blood
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days.
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown past medical history who presented after being found down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient's current condition includes a right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, and concerns about herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. The patient's neurological exam is difficult to interpret, and there is no evidence of hydrocephalus on the latest head CT. The patient also has a large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and passed a large clot yesterday. Active t+s were observed, and the patient was transfused with a total of 4 units yesterday. The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with intubation for airway protection. The patient has bacteremia with GNR on outside hospital labs, hypernatremia with a sodium level of 147 from 162 on admission, acute renal failure that is resolving, and rhabdomyolysis with a rising CK level. The patient also has sacral ulcers, NSTEMI/Troponin leak, and hypothermia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Herniation: Due to the intraparenchymal hemorrhage and midline shift, the patient is at risk of herniation, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention.
2. Hydrocephalus: The presence of IVH and hydrocephalus increases the risk of complications such as increased intracranial pressure, impaired cerebral perfusion, and further neurological deterioration.
3. Vasospasm: Vasospasm can occur as a complication of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and may lead to decreased cerebral blood flow and potential ischemic injury.
4. GI bleeding: The ongoing GI bleeding poses a risk of hypotension, shock, and potential rebleeding.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires ongoing support with mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteremia increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
7. Hypernatremia: Rapid correction of hypernatremia can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, cerebral edema, and seizures.
8. Acute renal failure: Continued renal dysfunction may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for dialysis.
9. Rhabdomyolysis: Severe rhabdomyolysis can result in kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, and compartment syndrome.
10. Sacral ulcers: These ulcers may become infected and could potentially lead to cellulitis or osteomyelitis.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a large intracranial hemorrhage, resulting in poor neurological examination. He has been unresponsive and unable to provide history. The patient's goals of care do not align with aggressive treatment, as discussed with the family. The patient's condition includes hypernatremia, gastrointestinal bleed, gram-negative bacteremia, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH): The large intracranial hemorrhage with midline shift indicates a serious brain injury. The patient's poor neurological examination suggests a high risk of further neurological deterioration or even death.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 147 mmol/L, indicating hypernatremia. This can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed properly.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has experienced a significant gastrointestinal bleed, resulting in anemia. Continued bleeding may lead to hypovolemic shock and require additional interventions such as blood transfusions.
4. Gram-negative bacteremia: The presence of gram-negative bacteremia increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock. Timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is crucial to prevent further complications.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. If left untreated, this can progress to chronic kidney disease and require renal"

1. ICH (Intracerebral Hemorrhage): The patient's poor neurological exam and lack of improvement suggest that the ICH may be severe and life-threatening.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 147, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to dehydration and neurological complications.
3. GI Bleed/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss, resulting in anemia. Further bleeding can be life-threatening.
4. GNR Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by Gram-negative organisms. If not effectively treated, it can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential renal failure. This condition can be associated with decreased urine output and accumulation of waste products in the blood.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, indicating respiratory failure. Improper ventilation settings or complications like ventilator-associated pneumonia can"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations and neurosurgery recs
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday,
   tagged RBC scan showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on
   clot. Hemodynamically stable.
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - Transfusion goal >25
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
    # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   - F/u with family re: CMO status, whether they would appreciate hospice
   care.
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - f/u vanc level this morning
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - change to half-normal saline--free water repletion rate to D5 1/2NS
   at 75/hr
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days, GNRs in blood
   culture
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday; no plan for further debridement
   - Continue on vanc/zosyn
   - F/u vanc level this AM and resume if low
   - F/u culture data
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown past medical history. He presented to the hospital after being found down with several conditions, including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a right thalamic bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, and repeat CT showing stable to slightly worse progression. Concerns include herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery did not recommend interventions.
2. Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret due to propofol sedation. The patient initially responded to pain but is now not responding. The new head CT does not show evidence of hydrocephalus.
3. GI bleed: The patient has large amounts of melena/brb output per flexi seal and passed a large clot yesterday. He was transfused with 4 units of blood and a tagged RBC scan showed sigmoid bleeding. The interventional radiologist (IR) was unable to intervene on the clot. The patient is hemodynamically stable.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection/respiratory failure. ABG showed pH 7.31, PaCO2 49, and SaO2 510. The chest X-ray remains clear.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has a GNR infection on outside hospital labs. Further speciation is needed. Cultures are pending.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level has decreased from 162 on admission to 147 due to hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for hyperglycemia is 167. A free water deficit of approximately 7.2L was calculated, and the sodium level was corrected to 147.
7. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal failure is resolving, with an unknown baseline creatinine. It is unlikely that rhabdomyolysis contributed to renal failure given the relatively low level, and it is more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
8. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level is rising (600->800) likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis after being down for an unknown period of time.
9. Sacral ulcers: Large eschars on the patient's L back and coccyx suggest that he was down for several days. GNRs were cultured from blood.
10. NSTEMI/Troponin leak: The patient had a troponin I level of 0.06 at the outside hospital. The EKG does not show evidence of ST changes, and CKs are attributed to rhabdo. No longer an active issue.
11. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia could be due to central hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency. BAIR hugger is used as needed, now off since yesterday. The patient's TSH will be checked, along with blood and urine cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient's condition may worsen due to herniation, hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurologic deterioration and increased intracranial pressure are potential complications.
2. GI bleeding: Continued bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract could lead to further blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient may develop ventilator-associated pneumonia or complications related to long-term intubation, such as vocal cord edema or tracheal stenosis.
4. Bacteremia: The infection could spread to other organs, leading to sepsis or septic shock.
5. Hypernatremia: Rapid correction of sodium levels could lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient may develop worsening renal function or require dialysis.
7. Rhabdomyolysis: Myoglobinuria and acute kidney injury"

   24 Hour Events:
   Pt w/ very large amount of bright and dark RBPR since early AM. Surgery
   and GI consulted. Pt went for tagged RBC scan which showed active
   sigmoidal bleed. Went to IR angio but they did not intervene as Pt was
   actively bleeding. Transfused 2 units in AM, Hct relatively stable
   28--30 on multiple Hct checks. Started on Levophed for hypotension,
   tachycardia around 4pm. Pt notably diaphoretic. At 9:30 PM passed very
   large clot per rectum and blood spilling out afterwards. Hct ordered.
   Transfused 2 more units. Pressures came up on his own. Now off
   pressures.
   Discussions held with [**Name (NI) 434**] brother and father throughout the day.
   Brother expressed desire to move Pt towards CMO. Father more reluctant
   to do so, but seems to be considering and may make CMO in AM. Pt DNR
   now.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  CTA of head indicated right thalamic
   bleed with IVH and hydrocephalus, midline shift, with repeat CT stable
   to slightly worse. Concerns in the setting of IPH include herniation,
   hydrocephalus, and vasospasm. Neurology and neurosurgery saw the
   patient in the emergency room and did not recommend interventions.
   Dilantin was DC
d.  Neurologic exam is difficult to interpret.  He had
   some response to pain yesterday, although this morning, off propofol he
   is not responding. Initial read of new head CT does not show any
   evidence of hydrocephalus.
   - f/u final read of this morning
s head CT: progression of bleed and ?
   cerebellar lesion
   - Appreciate neurology recommendations and neurosurgery recs
   - neuro checks q1-2 hours per discussion
   - keep HOB > 30 degrees
   - BP control keep SBP between 120-160, MAP < 110
   - no antiplatelet agents, no hepSubQ for 48-72 hours
   - Obtain FLP, HgA1c, trend CEs
   - Tylenol PRN for normothermia
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday,
   tagged RBC scan showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on
   clot. Hemodynamically stable.
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - Transfusion goal >25
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
    # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   - F/u with family re: CMO status, whether they would appreciate hospice
   care.
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - f/u vanc level this morning
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - change to half-normal saline--free water repletion rate to D5 1/2NS
   at 75/hr
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days, GNRs in blood
   culture
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday; no plan for further debridement
   - Continue on vanc/zosyn
   - F/u vanc level this AM and resume if low
   - F/u culture data
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown past medical history who presented with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO) and is currently on a morphine drip.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has large eschars on his L back and coccyx, suggesting possible prolonged immobility. This increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers and subsequent infections. Additionally, the presence of GNRs in the blood culture indicates a possible bacterial infection.

2. Respiratory distress: Although the patient was extubated yesterday, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to underlying lung issues or complications from previous respiratory support.

3. Bleeding: The patient had a large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and passed a large clot, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring renal function and providing appropriate supportive care is essential.

5. Hypothermia: The patient has a low body temperature of 36.2°C. Hypothermia can lead to various complications, including cardiovascular instability, impaired cellular metabolism, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   Per discussion with family made comfort measures only on Friday [**4-30**].
   # Comfort: patient appears comfortable
    - continue morphine drip
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot yesterday, transfused total of 4 units yesterday,
   tagged RBC scan showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on
   clot. Hemodynamically stable.
   - active t+s, type and cross as well
   - GI consulted, appreciate recs
   - Transfusion goal >25
   - continue protonix
   - 3 large bore IVs
    # goals of care
   - family discussions pending, patient currently made DNR, considering
   CMO
   - F/u with family re: CMO status, whether they would appreciate hospice
   care.
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - Decrease FiO2
   - Continue on vent for airway protection
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - call for further speciation
   - will follow cultures here which are all still NGTD
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - f/u vanc level this morning
   # Hypernatremia: Na now 147 from 162 on admission likely due to
   hypovolemic hypernatremia. Adjusted serum sodium level for
   hyperglycemia is 167. Free water deficit was approximately 7.2L. Na to
   147 this AM
   - change to half-normal saline--free water repletion rate to D5 1/2NS
   at 75/hr
   - q6h lytes
   # Acute renal failure: Resolving, unknown baseline creatinine. Unlikely
   that rhabdomyolysis contributing to renal failure given relatively low
   level, more likely a component of prerenal etiology.
   - f/u u/o
   # Rhabdomyolysis: CK is rising (600->800) likely secondary to
   rhabdomyolysis after being down for unknown period of time.
   - Continue IVF
   - Trend CK [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days, GNRs in blood
   culture
   - Follow wound care recs
   - Debrided by surgery yesterday; no plan for further debridement
   - Continue on vanc/zosyn
   - F/u vanc level this AM and resume if low
   - F/u culture data
   - Appreciate [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   - sutures need to be removed [**5-2**]
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - BAIR hugger prn, now off since yesterday
   - Will hold on checking [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for now as pt maintaining BP's
   - Check TSH, blood, urine cultures
   # Identification:
   [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 14108**]
   - Picked up at: [**Location (un) 14111**]. [**Apartment Address(1) **], [**Name (NI) 880**], MA
   Father: [**Name (NI) 31**] [**2106**]
   Brother: [**Name (NI) 1053**]
   # CODE: DNR but intubated
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown medical history who presented to the hospital after being found down with multiple medical conditions. These include intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient has been made comfort measures only and appears comfortable on morphine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a significant intraparenchymal hemorrhage, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, and potential deterioration.
2. GI bleed: The patient is experiencing ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of melena and a large clot passed yesterday. This can result in hypotension, shock, and further blood loss.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and barotrauma.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately. Fluid management and careful monitoring of renal function are essential.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and neurological complications if not corrected carefully.
6. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rising creatine kinase levels indicate r"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 137/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating possible infection. The platelet count is slightly low, while the other blood parameters are within normal range. The troponin-T level is elevated, suggesting cardiac injury. The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are mildly elevated, and the creatinine level is within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,081 mL and output of 2,035 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,046 mL. The urine output is within normal range. The patient is receiving morphine sulfate infusion for pain management and hydralazine for blood pressure control.

The patient appears comfortable and is breathing regularly without overt discomfort. Further assessment is needed to determine the cause of the elevated WBC and CRP levels, as well as the elevated troponin-T level.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo M with unknown past medical history presents after being found
   down with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal
   failure, hypothermia, GI bleeding, hypernatremia, anion-gap acidosis.
   Per discussion with family made comfort measures only on Friday [**4-30**].
   # Comfort: patient appears comfortable, was started on morphine
    - continue morphine drip
   # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage:  Stable according to last CT scan.
   Extubated yesterday
   - continue to monitor and keep comfortable
   # GI bleed: Pt w/ large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and
   passed large clot [**4-29**], transfused total of 4 units, tagged RBC scan
   showed sigmoid bleeding, IR felt unable to intervene on clot.
   Hemodynamically stable.
   - continue to keep comfortable
   # Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated at OSH for airway protection/
   respiratory failure. ABG in ED showed 7.31/49/510. CXR remains clear.
   - now extubated, continue to support
   # Bacteremia: GNR on outside hospital labs
   - not pursuing antibiotic therapy d/t CMO
   # Lab Abnormalities:  No longer checking labs.
   -continue supportive care
   # Sacral ulcers: Large (8cm in diameter) eschars on L back and coccyx
   and heel suggest that patient was down for several days, GNRs in blood
   culture
   - continue wound care, no further antibiotics
   # NSTEMI/Troponin leak: At OSH pt had trop I of 0.06. EKG does not show
   evidence of ST changes. CKs here attributed to rhabdo. No longer an
   active issue.
   # Hypothermia: Possible reasons for pt's hypothermia include: central
   hypothermia, exposure, infection, hypothyroidism, adrenal
   insufficiency.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with an unknown medical history who presented to the hospital after being found unresponsive. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia, and anion-gap acidosis. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 137/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is extubated and appears comfortable.

Medical Complications:

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has a stable intraparenchymal hemorrhage according to the last CT scan. Monitoring and keeping the patient comfortable will continue.

2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient experienced a large amount of melena/brb output per flexi seal and passed a large clot. He was transfused with a total of 4 units of blood products, and a tagged RBC scan showed sigmoid bleeding. Interventional radiology (IR) felt unable to intervene on the clot. The patient is hemodynamically stable, and comfort measures only will be continued.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated at the outside hospital for airway protection/respiratory failure. An arterial"
