   Pt is a 74 yo female with pmhx IPF, pulm htn, COPD here with increasing
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Dyspnea/increasing oxygen requirement/IPF/COPD: Patient has
   underlying IPF, COPD, pulm HTN and therefore small changes in the lungs
   can make a large difference in her status. Her new diagnosis of atrial
   fibrillation could be causing some pulmonary congestion due to
   tacchycardia and poor forward flow. She does have elevated JVP, pulm
   edema on cxr and trace pedal edema. Her ekg does not look ischemic at
   all. She could have a community accquired pna as her right lung looks a
   bit more consolidated than her previous cxr. Going against this is no
   fever, sputum or white count. PE would be very unlikely given very
   supratherapeutic INR although not completely impossible. No e/o COPD
   flare given no wheezing on exam.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing increasing oxygen requirements and dyspnea. She also has atrial fibrillation, which could be causing pulmonary congestion due to tachycardia and poor forward flow. Physical examination findings include elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and trace pedal edema. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) does not show signs of ischemia, suggesting that a heart attack is unlikely. There are concerns about a possible community-acquired pneumonia given the consolidation in her right lung on the chest X-ray. However, there are no signs of fever, sputum production, or elevated white blood cell count to confirm this diagnosis. Additionally, a pulmonary embolism (PE) is unlikely due to the supratherapeutic INR, although it cannot be completely ruled out. There is no evidence of a COPD flare-up as there is no wheezing on examination.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient has underlying IPF, COPD, and pulmonary hypertension, making her susceptible to small changes in the lungs that can significantly impact her condition. Her increasing oxygen requirement and dyspnea are consistent with her known diagnoses. The new"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), pulmonary hypertension, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities. She presents with increasing oxygen requirements, indicating respiratory failure. The underlying causes for her hypoxia include IPF, COPD, and pulmonary hypertension. The new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) may have precipitated the change in her condition, leading to pulmonary edema secondary to poor forward flow. An elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient has shown slight improvement with diuretic therapy (10 mg IV lasix) overnight. She has been prescribed additional lasix 20 mg IV and will continue to be monitored. Rate control of atrial fibrillation is ongoing with metoprolol, but it is not yet optimal. The patient's INR is still elevated and requires further monitoring. There are no signs of bleeding currently.

Other medical issues mentioned in the progress note include elevated liver function tests (LFTs), anemia, hypothyroidism, hypertension, depression, positive urine analysis without dysuria, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is also being managed for potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   oxygen requirement.
   #. Dyspnea/increasing oxygen requirement/IPF/COPD: Patient has
   underlying IPF, COPD, pulm HTN and therefore small changes in the lungs
   can make a large difference in her status. Her new diagnosis of atrial
   fibrillation could be causing some pulmonary congestion due to
   tacchycardia and poor forward flow. She does have elevated JVP, pulm
   edema on cxr and trace pedal edema. Her ekg does not look ischemic at
   all. She could have a community accquired pna as her right lung looks a
   bit more consolidated than her previous cxr. Going against this is no
   fever, sputum or white count. PE would be very unlikely given very
   supratherapeutic INR although not completely impossible. No e/o COPD
   flare given no wheezing on exam.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of IPF, pulmonary hypertension, and COPD. She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and increasing oxygen requirements. She is experiencing dyspnea and has a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. The patient's JVP is elevated, and there is pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. There are also trace pedal edema and a slight consolidation in the right lung, which could indicate a community-acquired pneumonia. However, there are no signs of fever, sputum production, or elevated white blood cell count, making a PE unlikely despite the supratherapeutic INR. No wheezing is present, suggesting no COPD flare-up.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying conditions of IPF, COPD, and pulmonary hypertension make her susceptible to respiratory failure. The increasing oxygen requirement and presence of pulmonary edema indicate ongoing respiratory distress.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has recently been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which can lead to poor forward flow and pulmonary congestion. It is important to control the heart rate and manage this condition.
3. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is significantly elevated, indicating a risk of bleeding. Vitamin K administration and fresh frozen plasma transfusion may be required.
4. Anemia: The patient appears to have anemia, although the etiology is unclear. Further investigation is needed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary hypertension, significant emphysema, chronic home oxygen use, and a recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and increasing oxygen requirements over the past two weeks. She has been started on metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control. 

On examination, the patient has elevated jugular venous pressure, crackles on bilateral chest auscultation, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/56 mmHg to 151/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results show an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, indicating possible congestive heart failure. The patient's white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count are within normal limits. However, her creatinine level is mildly elevated but has improved after diuresis. Other lab results, including electrolyte levels and liver function tests, are also provided.

Assessment and Plan:

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary hypertension, significant emphysema with 50 pack-years of tobacco use, chronic home oxygen therapy, and a loculated pleural process at the left costophrenic angle. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and recently started on coumadin and diltiazem.

The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and increasing oxygen requirements over the past two weeks. The note mentions that the patient is critically ill and currently experiencing respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and the new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation suggest a possible exacerbation of CHF in this patient. This can lead to worsening pulmonary edema and further respiratory distress.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient has been treated with coumadin, a lower suspicion for PE is noted given the absence of fever or leukocytosis. However, PE remains on the differential diagnosis list.

3. Acute exacerbation of IPF (AIPF): While AIPF remains on the differential diagnosis, it is less likely compared to CHF as the primary etiology of the patient's symptoms.

4. Infection: Although the patient does not have fever or leukocytosis,"

2. Hypoxia: The patient is hypoxic despite being on supplemental oxygen. The underlying lung diseases (COPD, pulmonary HTN, and IPF) along with mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation are contributing factors.

   Pt is a 74 year-old woman with a history of IPF, pulmonary
   hypertension, COPD, recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, who
   presents with an increasing O2 requirement.
   .
   #. Hypoxia:   Likely she has a component of volume overload and
   pulmonary edema from lack of atrial kick with MR  superimposed
   underlying lung disease (COPD, pulmonary HTN, and IPF).  Her O2
   requirement is decreasing steadily with diuresis. CXR not much changed
   She seems to have been diuresed maximally for now, given rising
   creatinine and bicarbonate.
   - continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   - no evidence of an infectious process, but given improvement on
   levofloxacin and baseline abnormal CXR, plan to continue to complete 5
   day course for CAP (also covering urine)

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of IPF, pulmonary hypertension, COPD, recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, who presents with increasing O2 requirement. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has respiratory failure due to chronic lung disease (COPD, pulmonary HTN, and IPF), which is worsened by MR and lack of atrial kick. Diuretics have been given to address volume overload and pulmonary edema, leading to a decreasing O2 requirement.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is better controlled with a higher dose of metoprolol. Anticoagulation is resumed when INR is below a certain level, and the possibility of cardioversion with cardiology involvement is discussed if the patient cannot be weaned back to baseline NC O2.

3. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is much improved after two doses of vitamin K. It should continue to trend.

4. Acute renal insufficiency: This is likely due to over-diuresis, as indicated by rising bicarbonate and elevated BUN/creatinine. Diuretics will be held today, and further evaluation is planned.

5. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs): These are increased from a normal baseline and are likely secondary to congestion from poor forward cardiac flow. They will continue to trend.

6. Anemia: The patient's anemia"

","The patient's chief complaint is hypoxia, respiratory distress, and congestive heart failure. The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary hypertension, significant emphysema with 50 pack-years of tobacco use, chronic home oxygen use, and a newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation for which she was recently started on coumadin and diltiazem.

The patient presented with progressive dyspnea and increasing oxygen requirements over the past two weeks. She was found to have an elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, suggesting congestive heart failure as the most likely cause of her worsening hypoxia, considering her limited lung reserve.

The patient has been treated with aggressive diuresis and improved heart rate control, which resulted in clinical and subjective improvement. She remains on higher supplemental oxygen than her prior baseline, but her fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) has been decreased from 100% non-rebreather to 50%. The plan is to continue weaning off oxygen as tolerated.

A potential complication that can arise is the inability to make further progress in decreasing her oxygen needs. In such cases, consideration may be given to possible cardioversion. However, due to her pulmonary hypertension and dilated right atrium on echo, she is unlikely to maintain normal sinus rhythm. 

Another complication is the development of metabolic alkalosis and mild bump in creatinine in the setting of diuresis"

   BNP very elevated and in setting of new a-fib congestive heart failure
   seems most likely etiology of worsening hypoxia in pt with little lung
   reserve.  Subjectively improving with diuresis though with baseline
   abnl imaging we see little change in cxr.  Had held on abg in setting
   of INR 21
s but would obtain abg now that INR has reduced. Now with met
   alkalosis and  mild bump in cr in setting of diuresis so will hold on
   additional lasix and allow to requilibriate.  Her INR has trended down
   with holding coumadin and vit k, will cotninue to montior this while
   holding coumadin. Rate control achieved with metoprolol. Will check

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary hypertension, significant emphysema, chronic oxygen dependency, and a newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. She presented with progressive dyspnea and increasing oxygen requirements over the past two weeks. Her BNP levels are very elevated, indicating congestive heart failure, which is likely the cause of her worsening hypoxia given her limited lung reserve. The patient has shown subjective improvement with diuresis. Her imaging shows little change in the chest X-ray, and there is a loculated pleural process at the left costophrenic angle. She also has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, for which she is being treated with levofloxacin. The patient's INR has been high due to coumadin use for atrial fibrillation, but it is now trending down after holding coumadin and administering vitamin K. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/48 to 139/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen support. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated creat"
