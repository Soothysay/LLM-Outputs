   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Shock - Patient hypotensive currently requiring levophed.  Given the
   patient's immunocompromised state and ventilator dependence infectious
   source is concerning.  The differential dx is broad, but given severe
   leukocytosis of 30K and 2 days of diarrhea it is most concerning for C.
   diff. Other possible sources include pulmonary source.  Pt with history
   of resistant organisms including VRE, ESBL, pseudomonas,
   stenotrophomonas. Other sources include UTI given + UA. Although degree
   of leukocytosis and absence of urinary or pulmonary symptoms makes pna
   or urosepsis less likely. Pt also is at risk for atypical infections
   given immunocompromised state, although he has been on ppx with bactrim
   (although recently restarted), voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro &
   acyclovir.  Additionally, pt my be volume depleted from diarrhea.  Also
   on the differential is cardiogenic, but unlikely.

   - IVF
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intermittently ventilator dependent.  He
   underwent trach on last admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH
   were AC Vt:600, RR:20, FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplantation (BMT), complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents from another hospital with hypotension and respiratory failure, requiring invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence, and is immunocompromised.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and fever. He has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 30.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and evidence of renal dysfunction. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormal liver function tests, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's medical history includes CML s/p BMT, complicated by GVHD, PE & DVT, bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and metronidazole, as well as prophylactic medications such as bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithromycin, and acyclovir.

   Plan:
   # Shock - Patient hypotensive currently requiring levophed.  Given the
   patient's immunocompromised state and ventilator dependence infectious
   source is concerning.  The differential dx is broad, but given severe
   leukocytosis of 30K and 2 days of diarrhea it is most concerning for C.
   diff. Other possible sources include pulmonary source.  Pt with history
   of resistant organisms including VRE, ESBL, pseudomonas,
   stenotrophomonas. Other sources include UTI given + UA. Although degree
   of leukocytosis and absence of urinary or pulmonary symptoms makes pna
   or urosepsis less likely. Pt also is at risk for atypical infections
   given immunocompromised state, although he has been on ppx with bactrim
   (although recently restarted), voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro &
   acyclovir.  Additionally, pt my be volume depleted from diarrhea.  Also
   on the differential is cardiogenic, but unlikely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by graft versus host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD. The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension and presumed sepsis. He has been on various medications including vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole, levophed, dopamine, and hydrocortisone. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 94/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is mechanically ventilated through a tracheostomy tube and is receiving intravenous fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. The presence of diarrhea raises concern for Clostridium difficile colitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further workup for infectious sources including urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, and atypical infections is ongoing.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is 0."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Shock - Patient hypotensive currently requiring levophed.  Given the
   patient's immunocompromised state and ventilator dependence infectious
   source is concerning.  The differential dx is broad, but given severe
   leukocytosis of 30K and 2 days of diarrhea it is most concerning for C.
   diff. Other possible sources include pulmonary source.  Pt with history
   of resistant organisms including VRE, ESBL, pseudomonas,
   stenotrophomonas. Other sources include UTI given + UA. Although degree
   of leukocytosis and absence of urinary or pulmonary symptoms makes pna
   or urosepsis less likely. Pt also is at risk for atypical infections
   given immunocompromised state, although he has been on ppx with bactrim
   (although recently restarted), voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro &
   acyclovir.  Additionally, pt my be volume depleted from diarrhea.  Also
   on the differential is cardiogenic, but unlikely.
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension
   -  CT-scan of the abd/pelvis to eval for colitis
   - Surgery consult recs
   - will need to place Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco/Meropenem (day1: [**12-31**])
   - cont hydrocort 50mg q6
   - trend lactate
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u stool studies
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - check CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   .
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - IVF
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intermittently ventilator dependent.  He
   underwent trach on last admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH
   were AC Vt:600, RR:20, FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT), complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents with hypotension and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 119/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with settings of AC Vt: 600, RR: 20, FiO2: 60%, and PEEP: 5 cmH2O.

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with hypotension requiring the use of levophed. The plan is to treat for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, which is likely causing the shock.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.5 on admission, but improved to 1.2 with intravenous fluids (IVF). The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.3, suggesting pre-renal azotemia due to persistent hypotension.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intermittently ventilator dependent and has a history of bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliter"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # C Diff colitis - Patient initially hypotensive requiring levophed,
   weaned off overnight. C diff positive, making this likely shock from c
   diff colitis.  All other culture data negative.  Now off pressors as of
   5 am.  Given SOB, concern for intra-abdominal perforation.  No free air
   visible on our read of KUB.
   - call surgery
   - f/u final read KUB
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension (day 1
 [**12-31**])
   - stop meropenem and IV vancomycin given  no other evidence of
   infectious source
   - continue stress-dose steroids for one more day
   - Pressors to goal CVP 8-12 (will not give more IVF for now)
   - Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - f/u CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve daily
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   - ABG and lactate 1500
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - plan to continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - restart prednisone when hydrocort is stopped (likely tomorrow)
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - cont lovenox 40mg q12 per prior regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF. Currently in
   sinus.
   - continue PRN metoprolol
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   # Opiate requirement:  has previously required high doses of narcotics,
   currently on lower dose
   - monitor for sx of withdrawal
   # Depression: cont citalopram
   #. FEN: hold TF given nausea/vomiting
   #. Access: PIV and midline
   - will need to place CVL
   #. Code Status: FULL Code

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypotension and suspected C. diff colitis, which is confirmed by a positive test. Other cultures are negative. The patient has a history of intermittent ventilator dependence and presents with symptoms of intra-abdominal perforation, although free air is not visible on the abdominal radiograph.

Plan:

1. C Diff Colitis:
- Call surgery to evaluate for intra-abdominal perforation.
- Follow-up final read of KUB.
- Administer PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for C. diff colitis presenting with hypotension.
- Stop meropenem and IV vancomycin since there is no evidence of other infectious sources.
- Continue stress-dose steroids for one more day.
- Maintain CVP 8-12 and monitor for hypotension; use levophed if needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 and urine output (UOP) > 30 cc/hr.
- Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures.

2. Acute Kidney Injury:
- Renal function has improved from 1.5 to 1.2 since admission, with a baseline of 0.7-0.9.
- Trend creatinine levels.
- Adjust medication dosages based on renal function and avoid nephrotoxins.

3. Respiratory Failure:
- The patient has volume overload in addition to baseline intermittently ventilator dependent.
- Continue current ventilator settings and wean oxygen as tolerated.
- Perform infectious workup for respiratory source as above.
- Continue outpatient nebulizer treatments.

4. CML s/p BMTs and chronic GVHD:
- Continue mycophenolate mofetil.
- Restart prednisone when hydrocortisone is stopped (likely tomorrow).
- Continue prophylactic antibiotics (bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithromycin, acyclovir).
- BMT team is aware and will follow up on recommendations.

5. Hx of PE and DVT:
- Continue enoxaparin 40mg q12 as per prior regimen.

6. Atrial Fibrillation:
- Currently in sinus rhythm.
- Continue PRN metoprolol.
- Patient on lovenox for anticoagulation.

7. Opiate requirement:
- Monitor for withdrawal symptoms.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has been admitted to the ICU with hypotension and a positive C. diff test. They are currently on vancomycin orally and intravenously, as well as flagyl. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and normal respiratory rate with supplemental oxygen. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. Fluid balance shows a significant net inflow of 7,013 mL and outflow of 1,741 mL, indicating fluid overload. The patient's extremities show edema, and their neurological exam is somnolent with normal tone. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 35.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine, and low albumin. The patient has severe C. diff and is being considered for early colectomy. They also have hypotension/sepsis, acute kidney injury, and chronic respiratory failure requiring continued ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which can be a result of severe illness, hypotension, or dehydration.
3. Fluid Overload: The significant net inflow of fluids exceeds the outflow, leading to fluid overload. This can increase the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including hypotension, Clostridium difficile (C.diff) infection, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and potential need for early colectomy. The patient has been on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, stress dose steroids, and supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a severe C.diff infection and is showing signs of hypotension, which can be indicative of sepsis. This condition can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on ventilator support due to chronic respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in lung function.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and renal function is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate perfusion to vital organs. Prompt intervention is necessary to stabilize blood pressure and prevent organ damage.
5. Potential Need for Early Colectomy: Due to the severe C.diff infection and the patient's critical condition, surgical consultation for early colectomy has been recommended. This procedure carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and potential complications related to anesthesia in a critically ill patient.

   presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension, found to have C. diff
   colitis.
   # C. diff colitis with septic shock - Patient initially hypotensive
   requiring levophed, which was weaned off yesterday but restarted
   overnight due to hypotension. Now with oliguria. All other culture data
   negative.  Abd CT [**2125-1-2**] showed no perf.
   - consider emergent surgery; surgery to discuss with family
   - Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - bolus now with 500 cc NS; monitor u/o, stool output, BP closely
   - continue PO & PR vanco 500mg Q6 and IV metronidazole (day 1

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT), complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents with sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient initially required levophed support but was weaned off yesterday. However, he restarted overnight due to hypotension. He also has oliguria and C. difficile colitis with no abdominal perfusion on CT scan. Other culture data is negative. The patient's recent findings include acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.9, respiratory failure with volume overload, and a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, metronidazole, tigecycline, bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithromycin, tobramycin, and citalopram. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis without organ dysfunction may progress to septic shock if not properly managed. 
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's increasing creatinine levels indicate worsening kidney function, which could potentially lead to renal failure if not addressed promptly.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's intermittent ventilator dependence and volume overload pose a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # C Diff colitis - Patient initially hypotensive requiring levophed,
   weaned off overnight. C diff positive, making this likely shock from c
   diff colitis.  All other culture data negative.  Now off pressors as of
   5 am.  Given SOB, concern for intra-abdominal perforation.  No free air
   visible on our read of KUB.
   - call surgery
   - f/u final read KUB
   - po & PR vanco 500mg Q6 and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting
   with hypotension (day 1
 [**12-31**])
   - continue stress-dose steroids for one more day
   - Pressors to goal CVP 8-12 (will not give more IVF for now)
   - Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - f/u CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve daily
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   - ABG and lactate 1500
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - plan to continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - restart prednisone when hydrocort is stopped (likely tomorrow)
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - cont lovenox 40mg q12 per prior regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF. Currently in
   sinus.
   - continue PRN metoprolol
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   # Opiate requirement:  has previously required high doses of narcotics,
   currently on lower dose
   - monitor for sx of withdrawal
   # Depression/Anxiety: cont citalopram
   #. FEN: hold TF given nausea/vomiting

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), previous pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence who presents from a rehabilitation hospital with hypotension. 

The patient's current condition includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), respiratory failure, chronic, acute kidney injury, and C. difficile colitis. 

The plan includes treating C. difficile colitis with vancomycin and metronidazole, assessing for intra-abdominal perforation, and monitoring for sepsis. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, chronic GVHD, history of PE and DVT, atrial fibrillation, high opiate requirement, depression/anxiety, and requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of kidney injury, progression of respiratory failure, development of new infections, exacerbation of chronic GVHD, recurrence of PE or DVT, and worsening of depression/anxiety."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), and chronic respiratory failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is being managed with multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/64 mmHg to 122/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. The patient has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and has shown improvement in urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of sepsis without organ dysfunction may progress to septic shock if not properly managed. This can lead to further hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's current oliguria (decreased urine output) and elevated creatinine levels indicate a risk for developing AKI. Prolonged hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion can contribute to this complication.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's chronic respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent this complication.

   q30minutes. Continue vanco po/pr, flagyl iv, will start tigecyline per
   ID. Decreased stress dose to q8.
   C.diff colitis: lactate increasing, more acidemic, abdomen more
   distended, wbc increased. Will ask heme onc if we can d/c cellcept.
   Will continue ongoing discussion with surgery,w e are concerned that
   window of opportunity to operate on him is closing.  change as many
   oral meds to iv as possible.
   ARF: likley ATN, vs prerenal.. sediment reported ? RBC casts
   exceedingly unlikely to have GN on cellcept and associated C.diff..will
   resend.. will continue hydration, electrolyte monitoring. Adjust meds
   to renal function
   Chronic respiratory failure: continue vent support at the current
   settings, not able to wean currenlty due to overwhelming sepsis and
   critical C.diff. PIP 15.
   DVT: will d/c lovenox and start heparin drip without bolus.
   Will meet with family to discuss goals and whether surgery would be an
   option.

   I saw and examined the pt, and was physically present with the ICU team

   note, including assessment and plan. 58 yo male s/p BMT with chronic
   GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, resp failure s/p trach, admitted with
   CDiff colitis and severe sepsis.
   Despite abx coverage with flagyl/vanco (PO/PR) he has continued to
   deteriorate with worsening multiorgan failure- shock requiring
   pressors, increasing acidosis, acute renal failure, tachypnea/abdominal
   pain, worsening leukocytosis, acute on chronic resp failure.
   Discussed with surgery and ID with recommendations for surgery- however
   after discussion of pt
s overall poor status, the magnitude of the
   operation, and high likelihood of poor prognosis/lengthy post-op
   course, his family has opted not to proceed with surgery. They
   recognize that medical management is not likely to be enough to
   adequately manage his CDiff colitis.
   Remains on flagyl, vanco, and adding tigecycline.
   On pressors, ventilator support with no plans to wean.
   Goals are to maintain current level of care and to facilitate pt
   comfort. If he were to deteriorate to the point of cardiac arrest, his
   family agrees that chest compressions/shock would not add significantly
   to his overall care, except to potentially cause him more discomfort.
   After further discussion, he is DNR. We will continue to keep in close
   contact with the family, but they are leaning toward re-addressing
   goals of care if there is no significant improvement in his status by
   tomorrow.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of bone marrow transplant (BMT) who is critically ill. He was admitted with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis and severe sepsis. Despite receiving antibiotic coverage with Flagyl and Vancomycin, the patient's condition has worsened, resulting in multiorgan failure, shock requiring pressors, increasing acidosis, acute renal failure, tachypnea, abdominal pain, worsening leukocytosis, and acute on chronic respiratory failure.

The patient's family has opted not to proceed with surgery due to the patient's overall poor status and the high likelihood of poor prognosis and a lengthy post-operative course. The medical team agrees that medical management alone is unlikely to adequately manage the C. diff colitis.

The patient remains on Flagyl, Vancomycin, and Tigecycline. He is on pressors and ventilator support with no plans to wean. The goals of care are to maintain the current level of care and to facilitate patient comfort. The patient has been declared DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and the family is leaning toward re-addressing goals of care if there is no significant improvement by tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic shock: The patient's worsening condition suggests a possible progression to septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death if not managed promptly and effectively.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of C.diff diarrhea. They have been experiencing various medical complications, including septic shock, renal failure, C.diff colitis, acute respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia and low blood pressure. They are receiving multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care for their respiratory failure. The patient's family has been informed about the seriousness of their condition and the potential need for surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to C.diff colitis. This is a life-threatening condition characterized by low blood pressure, inadequate tissue perfusion, and organ dysfunction. Immediate management includes fluid resuscitation and administration of appropriate antibiotics.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to sepsis and C.diff colitis. This condition is indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels and a decrease in urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as fluid administration and medication adjustment, is necessary.

3. C.diff Colitis: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest an infection with Clostridium difficile (C.diff), leading to colitis. This condition can cause severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, and systemic toxicity. Treatment involves discontinuing offending agents,"

   Renal Failure: worsening, somewhat more acidemic, electolytes still in
   reasonable rise. will follow up electrolytes close. more hyponatremic,
   continue volume resusitation. goal CVp 8-12
   Fever: pan culture, obtain CXR.. will not broaden empirically given
   severe lifethreating C.diff.
   Respiratory failrue: continue supportive care not able to wean off due
   to abdominal sepsis.
   FEN: holding tube feeds due to high residuals.
   DVT/PE: on heparin iv
   Hyponatremia: continue IVF resusitation.  recheck set of electrolytes
   later today.
   Pain: use dilaudid over morphine due to worsening renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He has been diagnosed with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), respiratory failure due to tracheostomy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient also has severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis and sepsis. He remains critically ill with worsening acute renal failure, continued acidosis, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic respiratory failure.

The patient is on antibiotics for C. diff, including vancomycin orally and intravenously, metronidazole, and tigecycline. He is also receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and supportive care with intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires pressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). Mechanical ventilation is ongoing, with no plans to wean vent settings. Acute renal failure is present, likely due to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and the patient is being volume resuscitated with a goal central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-12 mmHg. Electrolytes are being closely monitored.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he is currently in the intensive care unit"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with severe C. diff colitis. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, tigecycline, IVIG, and flagyl. The patient's condition is deteriorating, with rising lactate levels, worsening renal failure, and increased fever. They are also experiencing respiratory failure and hyponatremia. The patient's blood pressure remains low, and they have edema in their lower extremities. Their white blood cell count is elevated, and there is evidence of renal failure. The patient has been placed on DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a result of C. diff colitis, and the ongoing infection could lead to further complications and deterioration of the patient's condition.
2. Multi-organ failure: Given the worsening renal failure, respiratory failure, and other systemic signs of infection, there is a risk of multi-organ failure.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient is experiencing hyponatremia, which can lead to neurological complications if not managed properly.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE): The patient is at risk for DVT/PE due to immobilization and critical illness.
5. Complications from prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's inability to be weaned off"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. These include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has diffuse erythema over the back, multiple skin breakdown, and ecchymoses. This indicates poor wound healing and potential susceptibility to infections.

2. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient's clinical deterioration, metabolic acidosis, worsening leukocytosis, and the presence of multiple infections suggest a severe systemic infection that has affected multiple organs.

3. Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic: The patient's low blood pressure (BP) readings, along with the need for vasopressor support (norepinephrine), indicate possible inadequate blood flow to vital organs.

4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The elevated serum creatinine levels (1.2, 1.3, 1.9, 2.5) and decreased urine output (316 mL, 190 mL) suggest impaired kidney function.

5. Clostridium difficile infection (CDIFF colitis, C. difficile): The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which is evident from the abdominal distension and rare bowel sounds.

6. Acute pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, as indicated by the presence of an arterial line and the use of pain medication (hydromorphone).

7. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient requires ongoing tracheal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. These include impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock, acute renal failure, Clostridium difficile infection, acute pain, chronic pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), chronic respiratory failure, and tracheostomy support.

The patient has been deteriorating clinically with worsening leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. There is also a mention of the belly getting bigger, which could indicate abdominal distention or swelling.

The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (101 bpm) and low blood pressure (90/50 mmHg). The respiratory rate is within normal limits (21 breaths per minute), and the oxygen saturation is at 98% on a tracheostomy tube with controlled mechanical ventilation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,533 mL and output of 1,731 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 802 mL. The patient's urine output is 316 mL, NG output is 275 mL, and drain output is 140 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 35.0 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 24.6-31.6%, and elevated platelet count (Plt) of [**Telephone/Fax (3) 11661**]96.

The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range (between 113-140 mg/dL). However, there are abnormalities in kidney function tests, including increased creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 1.2-2.5 mg/dL and decreased albumin at 2.4 g/dL.

The patient has multiple medications including heparin sodium, norepinephrine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), lansoprazole (Prevacid), lorazepam (Ativan), and morphine sulfate.

Overall, the patient is facing multiple organ dysfunction, including respiratory, renal, and possible gastrointestinal issues. The presence of Clostridium difficile infection and sepsis indicates a severe systemic infection. The patient's deteriorating condition requires immediate attention and intervention to address these complications and stabilize their health."

   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF, but slowly increasing to 2.5 today. Likely
   poor renal perfusion due to intravascular depletion, also in setting of
   high intraabdominal pressure. Makes about 10 cc of urine per hour.
   - treat shock as above
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT), complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD. He presents from a rehabilitation hospital with hypotension, found to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. C. diff colitis with septic shock: The patient is requiring escalating doses of norepinephrine and has oliguria. An abdominal CT scan showed no perfusion. The family declined surgery. IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and tigecycline were added yesterday. The patient's white blood cell count is still very elevated in the mid-40s. Minimal stool output is now observed.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is increasing from 1.2 to 2.5 today. This is likely due to poor renal perfusion caused by intravascular depletion and high intraabdominal pressure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has volume overload in addition to intermittent ventilator dependence. He underwent tracheostomy during his last admission due to hypoxia. The current ventilator settings are set at tidal volume (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a complex medical history including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT), complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans. He presents with hypotension and is found to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. The patient is in septic shock and requires escalating doses of norepinephrine. He also has acute kidney injury, hyponatremia, respiratory failure, and a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has diffuse erythema over the back and multiple skin breakdown and ecchymoses, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
2. Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient is experiencing septic shock, indicating a severe infection with systemic involvement and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Shock, Hypovolemic or Hemorrhagic: The patient's low blood pressure and oliguria suggest hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Kidney Injury, ARF): The patient's rising creatinine levels and low urine output indicate acute kidney injury, possibly due to poor renal perfusion and high intraabdominal pressure.
5. C. Difficile Infection (C. Diff, C. Diff Colitis, Clostridium Difficile): The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, which can lead to severe gastrointestinal symptoms and can increase the risk of complications such as sepsis.
6. Acute Pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, likely due to various factors including C. diff colitis, skin breakdown, and underlying medical conditions.
7. Pain Control (Acute Pain, Chronic Pain): The patient's opioid requirement indicates a need for effective pain management.
8. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient is currently in septic shock, there is a possibility of developing sepsis without organ dysfunction if the condition improves.
9. Hypotension (Not Shock): The patient's ongoing hypotension, even after receiving norepinephrine, indicates a need for further evaluation and management.
10. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient's history of intermittent ventilator dependence and bronchiectasis suggests a chronic respiratory failure, which may require long-term ventilatory support.

The patient's complex medical history, ongoing sepsis, organ dysfunctions, and potential complications highlight the need for careful monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension and found to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. 

The patient is requiring escalating doses of norepinephrine and has oliguria. An abdominal CT scan showed no perfusion, and the family declined surgery. The patient is now on IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and tigecycline. The white blood cell count is still very elevated in the mid-40s. Minimal stool output is observed.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, metronidazole, tigecycline, and IVIG. Pressor support is needed to maintain blood pressure and urine output. Stress-dose steroids are also being administered. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures are pending recheck.

The patient's code status has been changed to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI). The oncologist is aware of the patient's condition, and discussions regarding the goal of care have been held with the family. 

Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has diffuse erythema over the back with multiple skin breakdown and ecchymoses.
2. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient has C. diff colitis with septic shock.
3. Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic: The patient is requiring escalating doses of norepinephrine.
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.2 to 2.5, indicating poor renal perfusion.
5. C. difficile infection (C diff, Cdiff colitis, Clostridium difficile): The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis.
6. Acute pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain.
7. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient requires pain management.
8. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient had sepsis without organ dysfunction prior to the development of severe sepsis.
9. Hypotension (not shock): The patient initially presented with hypotension.
10. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is intermittently ventilator dependent.
11. Impaired renal function: The patient's renal function is impaired.
12. Acute kidney injury: The patient has developed acute kidney injury.
13. Bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans: The patient has a history of these conditions related to GVHD.
14. Chronic GVHD: The patient has chronic GVHD.
15. History of PE and DVT: The patient has a history of PE and DVT.
16. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He also has respiratory failure secondary to tracheostomy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient is critically ill with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis and sepsis. He remains febrile and requires intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses to maintain urine output. The patient's condition is worsening, with acute renal failure, septic shock, acidosis, and acute on chronic respiratory failure. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, metronidazole, and tigecycline for C. diff. Prognosis remains poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Megacolon: The patient's lack of stool output is concerning for megacolon, which can be a complication of C. diff infection.
2. Abdominal Sepsis: The patient's fever and worsening condition may indicate abdominal sepsis, which could be caused by a bacterial infection in the abdomen.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of left lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by increasing creatinine levels.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with hypotension. They have been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and require iVF boluses to maintain urine output. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.0°F (38.9°C), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/57 mmHg to 133/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's CVP is 6 mmHg, total input/output balance shows an excess of 3,055 mL output, and blood products given amount to 165 mL.

Physical examination reveals scleral edema, warm skin, and diffuse anasarca with weeping. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive with no spontaneous movement and normal muscle tone. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, low potassium, and low albumin levels. Imaging shows left lower lobe consolidation or atelectasis, and microbiology data is pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for Clostridium difficile infection, worsening renal failure with plans to discontinue voriconazole and change antibiotic therapy, persistent fever with concerns for worsening abdominal sepsis or pneumonia, ongoing shock, and chronic respiratory failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplantation (BMT), complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD. The patient presents from a rehabilitation center with hypotension and is found to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. He requires escalating doses of norepinephrine and has oliguria. An abdominal CT scan shows no perfusion. The family declined surgery. The patient has received IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and tigecycline. The current medications include vancomycin, metronidazole, tigecycline, acyclovir, tobramycin, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient's mental state may contribute to ineffective coping, which could be due to his diagnosis and current condition.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has diffuse erythema over the back, multiple skin breakdown, and ecchymoses, indicating impaired skin integrity.
3. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient has C. diff colitis with septic shock, evidenced by the need for escalating doses of norepinephrine and oliguria.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock, acute renal failure, C. difficile infection, acute pain, pain control, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, chronic respiratory failure, and the need for nutrition and glycemic control support.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments and interventions such as systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a PPI, and VAP prevention measures like head of bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake up, and respiratory system assessment.

The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (120 bpm) and temperature (39.2 C or 102.6 F), with slightly low blood pressure (94/54 mmHg). The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits (19 breaths per minute), and their oxygen saturation is at 98% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (35.0 K/uL), elevated blood glucose levels (140 mg/dL), elevated lactate levels (1.1 mmol/L), low albumin levels (2.4 g/dL), and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels (2.8 mg/dL).

Overall, the patient is facing multiple medical challenges requiring close monitoring and management"

   obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence who
   presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension, found to have C. diff
   colitis.
   # Goal of care: Based on the patient
s deteriorating clinical status, a
   decision was made with his sister to focus on comfort and not advance
   further, including the withdrawal of pressors upon her arrival.
   All other issues are ongoing but will not be actively addressed:
   # C. diff colitis with septic shock - Patient is requiring escalating
   dose of norepinephrine. With oliguria. Abd CT [**2125-1-2**] showed no perf.
   Family declined surgery. IVIG and tigecycline added yesterday. WBC
   still very elevated in 30

   - discuss goal of care as below
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF, but slowly increasing to 2.7 today. Likely
   poor renal perfusion due to intravascular depletion, also in setting of
   high intraabdominal pressure. Makes about 10 cc of urine per hour.
   - treat shock as above
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   - consider changing IV voriconazole to po

   Patient continues to become progressivly more hypotensive with
   decreasing UOP and persistent fever.  Discussed situation with sister
   and she has decided to not escalate further care with additional
   vasopressors.  She wishes to make focus on comfort measures but will
   await her arrival.  For now, continue current care without any further
   escalation.  Continue prn dilaudid for pain control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently experiencing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with bowel obstruction (BO). The patient has severe Clostridium difficile (Cdiff) colitis and is admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. His laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and renal dysfunction. The patient has multiple ulcers on his skin and is sedated with no neurological assessment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can be a life-threatening complication.
2. Multiorgan Failure: Given the patient's renal dysfunction and other organ dysfunctions, there is a risk of multiorgan failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, indicating respiratory failure or severe respiratory distress.
4. Infection: Severe Cdiff colitis can lead to infection and sepsis, especially in immunocompromised patients.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Severe colitis can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, which may manifest as melena or hematochezia.
6. Septic Shock: The combination"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He is experiencing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bronchiolitis obliterans. The patient's current condition includes severe Clostridium difficile colitis, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and anemia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his vital signs show a temperature of 102.6°F, blood pressure of 86/54 mmHg, heart rate of 125 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased platelet count. His kidney function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels, and his liver function tests show mild abnormalities. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances with low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient's condition has been deteriorating despite treatment, and the family has decided to focus on comfort measures while continuing mechanical ventilation. Antibiotics and pressors have been stopped, and morphine infusion has been started for pain control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of kidney function, development of infections due to immunosuppression, and complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate supportive care will be necessary to manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient continues to become progressivly more hypotensive with
   decreasing UOP and persistent fever.  Discussed situation with sister
   and she has decided to not escalate further care with additional
   vasopressors.  She wishes to make focus on comfort measures but will
   await her arrival.  For now, continue current care without any further
   escalation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with bronchitis obliterans (BO). He is currently in the ICU with severe Clostridium difficile (Cdiff) colitis, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and anemia. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension requiring vasopressors, acute kidney injury, respiratory distress, and sepsis. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. The patient's family has decided to focus on comfort measures and not escalate further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest a possible ongoing infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output (OL 330 mL) indicates potential AKI, which could be due to sepsis, hypoperfusion, or nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation suggest a risk of respiratory failure, possibly due to severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Clostridium difficile (Cdiff) Colitis: The patient's severe Cdiff col"

 COMFORT CARE (CMO, COMFORT MEASURES)
   This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT [**2121**]
   complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis
   obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence who
   presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension, found to have C. diff
   colitis.
   # Goasl of care: Based on the patient
s deteriorating clinical status,
   a decision was made with his sister [**Name (NI) 11689**] to focus on comfort and not
   advance further, including the withdrawal of antibiotics and pressors.
   This morning he was disconnected from the ventilator.
   All other issues are ongoing but will not be actively addressed:
   # C. diff colitis with septic shock - Patient is requiring escalating
   dose of norepinephrine. With oliguria. Abd CT [**2125-1-2**] showed no perf.
   Family declined surgery. IVIG and tigecycline added yesterday. WBC
   still very elevated in 30
s. Minimal stool output now.
   - continue PO and PR vancomycin, metronidazole, tigecycline
 already
   received IVIG; increase metronidazole to q6h
   - pressor as needed to maintain BP and urine output
   - continue stress-dose steroids
   - re-check blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c bactrim, voriconazole, azithro per ID; continue acyclovir, tobra
   inh
   - KUB
   - discuss goal of care as below
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF, but slowly increasing to 2.7 today. Likely
   poor renal perfusion due to intravascular depletion, also in setting of
   high intraabdominal pressure. Makes about 10 cc of urine per hour.
   - treat shock as above
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   - consider changing IV voriconazole to po
   - wil check voriconazole level
   #. Hyponatermia: Likely hypervolemic hyponatermia from ARF and poor
   UOP.
   -- cont to trend
   -- urine lytes
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - hold mycophenolate mofetil; discussed with oncology
   - hydrocort to q8h
   - change prophylactic regimen as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and antifungal medications. Vital signs show a high temperature of 102.4°F (39.1°C), elevated heart rate of 108 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 33-19 mmHg, increased respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 600 mL and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and altered vital signs suggest the possibility of sepsis, especially considering the recent use of multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.
2. Organ dysfunction: The low blood pressure and abnormal laboratory values may indicate organ dysfunction, such as renal or hepatic impairment.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
5. Stress ulcers: The ICU stay and use of vasopressors increase the risk of stress ulcers.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance appears to be negative, which may lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT), complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), previous pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (PE/DVT), bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD. The patient presents from a rehabilitation center with hypotension and is found to have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. 

The patient's clinical status has deteriorated, and the family has decided to focus on comfort care rather than advancing further treatment. The patient requires escalating doses of norepinephrine and is experiencing oliguria. An abdominal CT scan showed no perfusion, and the family declined surgery. IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and tigecycline were added yesterday, and the patient's white blood cell count is still very elevated.

The patient has multiple ongoing issues, including C. diff colitis with septic shock, acute kidney injury, hyponatremia, respiratory failure, CML post BMT with chronic GVHD, history of PE/DVT, atrial fibrillation, opioid requirement, depression/anxiety, and nausea/vomiting. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his emergency contact is his sister.

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname **] with the ICU Fellow, whose note above
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 58 y/o man with a
   history of CML s/p BMT presented with septic shock and respiratory
   failure from severe C. difficile colitis.  Ongoing discussions with the
   patient and his family have led to a progressive move toward
   comfort-focused care.  His vasopressors had been discontinued, and this
   morning mechanical ventilation was discontinued.  He continues on
   morphine infusion, which has been escalated to help control his
   tachypnea.  On exam, he is mildly tachycardic (100s) and is breathing
   in the 20s with some retractions.  He does not appear distressed.  We
   will titrate morphine to keep respiratory rate at 25 or below; some
   challenges with this given his prior longstanding narcotic needs, so
   liberalizing his range.  Requires ICU care for medication titration
   until we ensure that he has adequate comfort.  Consider humidified air.
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 593**] and I met with several members of his family, and all
   questions were answered.  Critically ill: 35 min

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He is now experiencing septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) secondary to severe Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) colitis. The patient has been unresponsive and unable to provide any history.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's temperature has been elevated at 102.4°F. Vasopressors were stopped, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The patient is currently on morphine sulfate infusion for pain management and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 89/20 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's condition is described as comfort measures only (CMO), indicating that further aggressive treatment will not be pursued.

The physical examination reveals tracheostomy in place, but no other significant findings are mentioned due to the patient's unresponsive state. Lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose, and other markers.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient's condition indicates several potential medical complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's elevated temperature, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest septic shock, which"
