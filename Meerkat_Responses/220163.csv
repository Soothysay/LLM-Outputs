","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AFib) who was admitted to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock. The patient has been volume overloaded but is currently stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation. She has several medical complications including potential transudative pleural effusions, congestive heart failure (CHF), AFib, CAD, anemia, elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and dirty urinalysis (UA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Transudative Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pulmonary opacities on imaging, which suggest transudative pleural effusions. These effusions may be related to heart failure and volume repletion.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient exhibits diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component, and markedly elevated proBNP. This indicates possible CHF, which needs further evaluation and management.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib, but there is low suspicion for acute ischemia based on the absence of symptomatology and unchanged EKG. The patient is currently on amiodarone, and anticoagulation may be resumed if the patient's hemodynamic status is stable.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has asymptomatic CAD"

She was transferred to the ICU for management of C. difficile septic shock and is currently stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component, markedly elevated proBNP, and bilateral pulmonary opacities. This suggests the possibility of heart failure. Further evaluation with repeat TTE and gentle diuresis as tolerated by BP is recommended.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient was admitted for C. difficile septic shock. Although clinically no longer septic, there is a need to monitor for recurrence. Repeat toxin assay pending, and KUB to evaluate for megacolon should be considered. Surgical consultation may be required depending on CT results.

3. Bilateral Pulmonary Opacities: These opacities are suspected to be transudative pleural effusions due to volume repletion and heart failure. A CT chest without contrast is needed to rule out loculated effusion. Supplemental O2 and thoracentesis if effusions remain after correcting volume status and coagulopathy may be necessary.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): Low suspicion for acute ischemia based on absence of symptomatology and unchanged"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who was transferred from another hospital for the management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock. She is currently stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation, but volume overloaded. She has a background of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is on coumadin. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), with diastolic dysfunction and valvular disease, as well as hypertension (HTN), anemia, hypernatremia, and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF - The patient has diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component given valvular disease. There is evidence of decompensation in the setting of massive volume resuscitation and inadequate diuresis. The plan includes diuresis, supplemental oxygen, and repeat cardiac ultrasound.
2. Hypernatremia - The patient has a free water deficit of approximately 3 liters. The plan includes free water boluses through the nasogastric (NG) tube.
3. C. diff - The patient was previously septic with C. diff, but is now clinically stable. The plan includes discontinuing vancomycin and metronidazole, repeating toxin assays, and serial abdominal examinations.
4. UTI - The plan is to hold off on antibiotics"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the hospital for management of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) septic shock. The patient has several medical conditions including heart failure (CHF), aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid valve disease, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis, renal failure, and C. difficile infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5 F), a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 125/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, lactic acid, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with high levels of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-). The patient's albumin level is low at 2.9 g/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of volume overload, including increased jugular venous pressure (JVP), pitting edema in both lower extremities, and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. The"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who was admitted for management of Clostridium difficile septic shock. She is currently stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation but is volume overloaded.

Assessment and plan:
1. Heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic, due to aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid valve disease.
2. Hypernatremia.
3. Metabolic acidosis.
4. Respiratory acidosis.
5. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF).
6. C. difficile infection (C. diff, CDiff colitis, Clostridium difficile).
7. Coronary artery disease (CAD, ischemic heart disease).
8. Atrial fibrillation (AFib).

Plan:
1. CHF - diurese with lasix, maintain urine output goal of 100 cc/hr.
   Consider adding low-dose ACEi if blood pressure tolerates.
   Supplement oxygen to maintain saturation above 92%.
   Repeat chest X-ray in the morning and defer chest CT to assess resolution of bilateral opacities following diuresis.
   Repeat non-urgent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
2. Hypernatremia - free water deficit approximately 3 L.
   Administer free water boluses of 250 cc every 4 hours via nasogastric (NG) tube.
3. C. difficile - clinically no longer septic, abdominal exam benign, lactate within normal limits.
   Redose one dose of vancomycin per NG tube.
   Flagyl via NG tube.
   Keep Foley catheter in place.
   Repeat toxin assay pending.
   Serial abdominal exams.
   Consider wound care and culture/sensitivity for rectal tube.
4. UTI - hold off on antibiotics until culture data available.
   Obtain urine culture and sensitivities (UCx, BCx) pending.
   Change Foley catheter.
5. AFib - adequate rate control.
   Continue amiodarone at 200 mg daily following loading dose at other hospital.
   Hold digoxin for now to avoid interaction.
   Bridge with low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) followed by coumadin if does not require replacement of central line.
   Telemetry.
6. CAD - asymptomatic, unchanged EKG on admission, borderline troponin (in acute renal failure).
   Rule out with coronary angiography (CE).
   Initiate aspirin (ASA) 325 mg.
7. HTN - hold antihypertensives for now, may resume if blood"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). She was transferred to the ICU for management of C. difficile septic shock and is currently volume overloaded but stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation. The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. CHF - diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component given valvular disease; markedly elevated proBNP; decompensation in the setting of massive volume resuscitation and inadequate diuresis at OSH. 
   - Continue lasix gtt, volume goal -100 cc/hr; continue close monitoring of BP and electrolytes.
   - Repeat CXR in AM; will defer chest CT to assess resolution of bilat opacities after significant diuresis (low clinical suspicion for parapneumonic or loculated effusion).
   - Repeat non-urgent TTE.

2. Hypernatremia - free water deficit ~3 L.
   - Free water boluses 250 cc q4h per NG.

3. C. diff - clinically no longer septic, abdominal exam benign, lactate WNL.

","The patient is a 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the hospital for management of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) septic shock. She has undergone placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and has been receiving intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and other medications.

On review of systems, the patient complains of cough but reports improved ease of breathing. She expresses a desire to get out of bed to a chair today.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 147/51 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm.

Physical examination reveals moderate effort with decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, warm and dry extremities with improved lower extremity (LE) edema, and 2+ radial pulses. The abdomen is soft and nontender.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), elevated troponin T level, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's urine culture grew yeast, and she has candid"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). She was admitted to the hospital for management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock and was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH).
- The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF), with diastolic dysfunction and possible systolic component due to valvular disease. She has markedly elevated proBNP levels and experienced decompensation during massive volume resuscitation and inadequate diuresis at OSH.
- The patient is currently volume overloaded but stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation.
- The patient also has hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water boluses through the nasogastric (NG) tube.
- The patient's C. diff infection is clinically resolved, and she no longer exhibits signs of sepsis. Her abdominal exam is benign, and there is no radiologic evidence of toxic megacolon. A repeat toxin assay was negative, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) will be deferred due to low clinical suspicion for ischemia, megacolon, or abscess.
- The patient's urinary tract infection (UTI) is being monitored, and antibiotics will be held off until culture data are available.
- The patient's atrial"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted to the hospital for management of C. difficile septic shock. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF) with diastolic dysfunction, hypernatremia, Clostridium difficile infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and anemia. She is currently stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF: The patient's diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component due to valvular disease can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms such as dyspnea, edema, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 145 mEq/L, which may result in symptoms such as confusion, weakness, seizures, and dehydration if not managed properly.
3. C. difficile infection: Although the patient is no longer septic, there is still a risk of complications such as toxic megacolon, perforation, or abscess formation. Close monitoring of abdominal symptoms and repeated toxin assays are necessary.
4. UTI: The patient has a pending blood culture and yeast growth in the urinary catheter, indicating a possible infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics should be initiated based on"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock, fluid overload, and acute kidney injury. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 mmHg to 152/76 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on non-invasive ventilation and has been weaned off pressors. Physical examination reveals signs of volume overload, including decreased breath sounds in the anterior chest and bilateral lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicative of renal dysfunction. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with a high sodium level of 143 mEq/L. Imaging studies show no evidence of toxic megacolon or ischemic changes in the abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload and is currently showing signs of volume overload, such as decreased breath sounds in the anterior chest and bilateral lower extremities. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis will be necessary to prevent further fluid accumulation and associated complications.
2. Acute kidney injury"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock. The patient had previously undergone stent placement for CAD and was on warfarin for atrial fibrillation (AF). Upon transfer from the emergency department, she was found to be volume overloaded but stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. CHF - Diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component due to valvular disease. The patient has markedly elevated proBNP and decompensation following massive volume resuscitation and inadequate diuresis. Plan: Continue Lasix gtt, aim for a urine output of >100 cc/hr, monitor blood pressure and electrolytes closely, provide supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation >92%, repeat chest X-ray in the morning, and defer chest CT to assess resolution of bilateral opacities after significant diuresis.
2. Hypernatremia - Stable sodium level of 145. Plan: Continue free water boluses of 250 cc q4h via NG tube.
3. C. diff - Clinically no longer septic, abdominal exam is benign, lactate levels are within normal range. Plan: Continue oral vancomycin, repeat toxin assay, and perform serial abdominal exams.
4. Candiduria - Asymptomatic. Plan: Blood culture pending,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AFib), who was admitted to the hospital for management of C. difficile septic shock. She was previously volume overloaded but is now stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation. The patient has several medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient has diastolic dysfunction with a likely systolic component due to valvular disease. She also has markedly elevated proBNP levels. The decompensation occurred during massive volume resuscitation and inadequate diuresis at OSH. The plan is to continue Lasix infusion, aiming for a urine output of more than 100 cc/hr. Close monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes should be done.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is stable at 145. To address this, free water boluses of 250 cc every 4 hours via NG tube should be continued.

3. C. difficile: Although the patient is no longer septic, she should continue to receive oral vancomycin. The abdominal exam is benign, and there is no radiologic evidence of toxic megacolon. A repeat toxin assay is negative, so serial abdominal exams should be conducted. The patient should continue with rectal bag placement.

4. Candiduria: The patient has asymptomatic candiduria. Blood cultures are pending, and the"

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who was transferred to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) septic shock. She is currently volume overloaded but stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation. The patient has several medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), hypernatremia, candiduria, atrial fibrillation, CAD, hypertension, anemia, and hypothyroidism. She is receiving treatment for C. difficile infection, CHF, hypernatremia, candiduria, AF, and CAD. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her current disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation due to volume overload and inadequate diuresis.
2. C. difficile infection recurrence or complications such as toxic megacolon or bowel perforation.
3. Candiduria progression or development of systemic candidiasis.
4. AF with rate control issues and potential interaction with other medications.
5. CAD with ongoing ischemic changes and potential complications like myocardial infarction.
6. Hypertension management and potential organ damage.
7. Anemia worsening and potential bleeding complications.
8. Hypothyroidism management and potential complications like myxedema coma.
9. Aspiration pneumonia due to decreased protective airway reflexes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for management of C. difficile septic shock and is currently stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation. The patient has been volume overloaded but is responding well to diuretics. She has poor oral intake and is receiving nutrition through tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF - The patient is showing signs of diastolic dysfunction with a likely systolic component due to valvular disease. This could lead to further fluid overload and heart failure symptoms.
2. Hypernatremia - The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 143, indicating a risk of dehydration and potential complications if not managed appropriately.
3. C. difficile infection - Although the patient is no longer septic, there is still a risk of recurrence or complications such as toxic megacolon, bowel ischemia, or abscess formation.
4. Candiduria - The presence of yeast in the urine indicates a potential fungal infection, which may require treatment if it progresses or causes symptoms.
5. AFib - The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be adequately rate-controlled to prevent complications like stroke or heart failure.
6. CAD - The patient's coronary artery disease puts her at risk for myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
7. Anemia - The patient's low hemoglobin levels need to be monitored and managed appropriately"

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including heart failure (systolic, acute on chronic), aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid valve disease, hypernatremia (high sodium), metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis, renal failure (acute), Clostridium difficile infection, and coronary artery disease. The patient has undergone stenting of the left circumflex and right coronary arteries and has a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition is slowly improving, and diuresis with intermittent IV lasix has been effective in managing fluid overload. The patient is also receiving tube feedings due to poor oral intake. Afterload reduction and continued diuresis are planned. The patient's valvular disease will require further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen if fluid overload is not adequately managed, leading to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
2. Valvular Disease: The patient's valvular conditions, including aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid valve disease, need to be closely monitored for any deterioration. If these conditions worsen, they can lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Renal Failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB). The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid valve disease, hypernatremia (high sodium), metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis, renal failure, C. difficile infection, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and has undergone stenting of the left circumflex artery (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA).

The patient is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement slowly. They have good diuresis with intermittent IV lasix and continue to be overloaded with fluids. Their HCO3 levels have been rising, so they will increase CL replacement (as KCL). The patient is more alert today but still taking oral medications poorly, so tube feedings are being supplemented. Afterload reduction will be started, and the patient requires continued diuresis and further management of valvular disease.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through a pulmonary tube feeding and has peripheral IV lines. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. The patient is also on systemic anticoagulation and has a PICC line in place.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is to the floor. The patient"

   transferred from OSH for management of C. difficile septic shock,
   currently volume overloaded but stable off pressors and non-invasive
   ventilation.
   24 Hour Events:
   Planned to call her out to the floor when she began putting out BRBPR.
   She put out approx 450 cc of mixed blood and stool early yesterday
   afternoon.  The bleeding then appeared to stop.  NG lavage was
   negative.  GI was consulted and felt that it was most likely due to a
   LGI source (irritation of rectal tube in anticoagulated person).
   She was clinically stable throughout.  GI stated that if she rebleeds
   would most likely refer to angio if acutely unstable.   Holding
   coumadin and lovenox.
   Following Hct 28.9-> 26.9->25.5->24.4
   SUBJECTIVE:
   Patient feels well this morning.  She denies, N/V/ abdominal pain.  She
   denies fevers, chills.  She thinks that she will not be able to be
   continent of stool if we pull the rectal tube.  She prefers to leave
   the rectal tube in.

   for management of C. difficile septic shock, currently volume
   overloaded but stable.  Patient developed new GI bleed last night,
   likely from Lower source.  She remains hemodyamically stable.
   #GI bleed
 thought to be secondary to either colonic irritation from
   C. diff with anticoagulation or rectal tube irritation with
   anticoagulation.  Patient
s bleeding spontaneously resolved.  Patient
   had a colonoscopy done 3 years ago.  It did not show any evidence of
   diverticulosis at that time.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post stents, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) septic shock and is currently stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation.

24-hour events include a new gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely from a lower source. The bleeding spontaneously resolved, and no need for an endoscopy was required. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have decreased from 28.9% to 24.4% due to the bleeding and ongoing fluid resuscitation.

The patient's current medical conditions include congestive heart failure (CHF) with diastolic dysfunction and likely systolic component, C. difficile infection, recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), candiduria, AFib, CAD, hypertension (HTN), hypernatremia, chronic anemia, and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

Plan:

1. GI bleed: Hold lovenox and coumadin for 2-3 days. Transfuse 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to concern for rebleeding and likelihood of restarting anticoagulation in the next few days.
2. CHF: Start lasix boluses at 80mg IV B"

   currently volume overloaded but stable off pressors and non-invasive

   24 Hour Events:
   Planned to call her out to the floor when she began putting out BRBPR.
   She put out approx 450 cc of mixed blood and stool early yesterday
   afternoon.  The bleeding then appeared to stop.  NG lavage was
   negative.  GI was consulted and felt that it was most likely due to a
   LGI source (irritation of rectal tube in anticoagulated person).
   She was clinically stable throughout.  GI stated that if she rebleeds
   would most likely refer to angio if acutely unstable.   Holding

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-stent placement, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin. She was transferred to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock and volume overload. The patient is currently stable off pressors and non-invasive ventilation.

The patient experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to a lower gastrointestinal source, which has since stopped. She is holding coumadin and lovenox.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/37 mmHg to 121/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a decrease in hemoglobin levels from 28.9% to 24.4%, indicating ongoing blood loss or anemia. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU for management of C. difficile septic shock and is currently volume overloaded but stable. The patient developed a new gastrointestinal bleed last night, which spontaneously resolved. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient had a lower GI bleed that resolved spontaneously. There is a concern for rebleeding, especially given her anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring is required, and blood products may be needed for transfusion.

2. CHF: The patient has diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component due to valvular disease. She has markedly elevated proBNP levels and decompensation after massive volume resuscitation and inadequate diuresis. Lasix boluses are being given to achieve a urine output of >100 cc/hr. Close monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes is necessary.

3. C. difficile: The patient had C. difficile septic shock but is now clinically stable. Vancomycin will be continued for a total of 2-week course. Rectal bag will be continued.

4. Recent DVT: The patient had a recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her lower extremities, which was negative on ultrasound. A repeat LE Doppler exam will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and recent hospitalization for management of C. difficile septic shock. She presents with volume overload, atrial fibrillation, and Clostridium difficile colitis. The patient has had a new gastrointestinal bleed that spontaneously resolved, and no bleeding was noted overnight. She has diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component due to valvular disease, markedly elevated proBNP, and decompensation following massive volume resuscitation and inadequate diuresis at the previous hospital. The patient is being treated with Lasix boluses to achieve a negative fluid balance of 12-2 liters over 24 hours, close monitoring of blood pressure, and electrolyte management. She is also receiving supplemental oxygen, lisinopril for afterload reduction, and continued tube feeds. The patient's recent conditions include recent deep vein thrombosis, candiduria, coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic anemia, and hypernatremia. Her code status is DNR/DNI, and she is being managed in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock and volume overload. The patient has several medical complications including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, congestive heart failure (CHF), AFib, and C. diff infection. She also has chronic anemia, hypernatremia, and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient experienced a new GI bleed, likely due to colonic irritation from C. diff or anticoagulation therapy. This condition can lead to significant blood loss and requires close monitoring and potential transfusion.
2. CHF: The patient has diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component given valvular disease. Decompensation occurred during massive volume resuscitation and inadequate diuresis. Close monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and electrolytes is necessary. Lasix boluses should be given to achieve a negative fluid balance.
3. AFib: The patient's amiodarone dose was decreased too quickly, and there is concern about the possibility of worsening arrhythmia. Amiodarone loading will be done today, and telemetry monitoring will continue. Digoxin was started but is being held.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who was admitted to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock. She is currently volume overloaded but stable. The patient developed a new gastrointestinal (GI) bleed last night, which is likely secondary to either colonic irritation from C. diff or rectal tube irritation. The bleeding has spontaneously resolved. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new GI bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient had a new GI bleed, which is concerning. It may recur if not properly managed.
2. Volume Overload: The patient is volume overloaded, indicating that she has an excess amount of fluid in her body. This can lead to congestive heart failure (CHF) and pulmonary edema.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has AF, which increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events such as stroke.
4. C. diff Infection: Although the patient is no longer septic, there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the infection.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which can lead to neurological complications if not managed appropriately.
6. Chronic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which may require transfusion support.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock. She has a past medical history of atrial fibrillation (AF) on coumadin and has undergone stenting for CAD. The patient presented with volume overload and was found to have a GI bleed that resolved spontaneously. She has been diagnosed with chronic anemia, likely due to iron deficiency and acute kidney injury. Her electrolytes are somewhat imbalanced, with hypernatremia. She also has asymptomatic candiduria and chronic kidney disease. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, furosemide, and lisinopril.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient is currently volume overloaded, which can lead to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. GI Bleed: Although the patient's bleeding has resolved spontaneously, there is still a risk of recurrent bleeding, especially with the presence of anticoagulation therapy.
3. C. diff Colitis: The patient has been treated for C. diff infection, but there is still a risk of recurrence or worsening symptoms.
4. AF: The patient has a history of AF, and there is a concern that the decreased dose of amiodarone may have contributed to its recurrence. Close monitoring of the patient's rhythm and adjustment of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) who was admitted to the ICU for management of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) septic shock. The patient is currently stable but volume overloaded. She has a new gastrointestinal (GI) bleed likely secondary to C. diff or anticoagulation. The bleeding has spontaneously resolved, and no invasive management is recommended at this time. The patient's past medical history includes CAD, PAF on coumadin, and a previous colonoscopy without evidence of diverticulosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has experienced a new GI bleed that may be due to C. diff or anticoagulation. Close monitoring for signs of recurrent bleeding is essential.
2. Volume overload: The patient is currently stable but volume overloaded. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix is recommended to achieve a negative fluid balance within the next 24 hours.
3. CHF: The patient has diastolic dysfunction with likely systolic component due to valvular disease. Decompensation occurred during massive volume resuscitation and inadequate diuresis. Continued close monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes is necessary.
4. AFib: The patient's amiodarone dose was decreased too quickly, so reloading with amiodarone IV over 10 minutes followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5-1"
