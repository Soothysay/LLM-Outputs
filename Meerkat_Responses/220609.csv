The patient's condition has improved on the current treatment with steroids, antibiotics, and continuous nebs. The plan is to continue azithromycin, clindamycin (given penicillin allergy), and follow-up culture. Droplet precautions will be maintained to rule out flu and other respiratory viruses. Solumedrol 125mg will be given three times a day, with a plan to taper and resume home Advair. Serial ABGs will be done.

2. History of seizures: Phenytoin level is subtherapeutic. The home dose of Keppra (Levetiracetam) will be resumed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, paraplegia, significant psychiatric history, and seizures. She is currently experiencing an exacerbation of asthma/COPD and is in respiratory distress. Her condition has improved with continuous nebulizer treatments. She has a non-gap metabolic acidosis likely due to her urostomy, which can result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The patient also has a history of seizures, for which phenytoin was prescribed but not at a therapeutic level. The patient's mental health history includes adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features and personality disorder NOS. She is currently on home medications for her psychiatric condition. The patient has chest pain, possibly related to respiratory distress, and hypertension, which is currently being managed with atenolol and lisinopril. There is diffuse abdominal tenderness, which may be her baseline, and she has an ostomy that requires regular care. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presented with severe obstructive physiology, suggesting the possibility of a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) preceding the current presentation. It is important to continue current treatment with steroids, antibiotics, and continuous nebulizer therapy. Monitoring for any worsening of respiratory symptoms and adjusting treatment accordingly is necessary.

","The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, paraplegia, and psychiatric history, presenting with exacerbation of asthma/COPD. She is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving continuous nebs, steroids, antibiotics, and morphine for severe obstructive physiology. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate ranging from 77 to 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/55 to 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes throughout, limited chest movement, distant S1 + S2 heart sounds without murmurs, rubs, gallops, tender abdomen around urostomy without signs of inflammation, non-distended bowel with present sounds, and warm, well-perfused extremities. 

Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet levels, normal creatinine level, elevated lactate level, and slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels. The rest of the lab values are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, history of seizures, psych issues, chest pain, hypertension, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and ostomy care.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, paraplegia, psychiatric history, and seizure disorder.
- She presented with severe respiratory distress, which improved on continuous nebulizers (nebs).
- The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to her urostomy and elevated lactate levels.
- She also has a history of seizures, for which phenytoin was started but the level was subtherapeutic, so the home dose will be resumed.
- The patient has a psychiatric diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features and personality disorder NOS.
- She experiences chest pain, which is likely related to respiratory distress.
- The patient has hypertension and is currently not on any antihypertensive medication.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has an altered mental status, asthma, and pain control issues. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium.

From the vital signs section, the patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.6°C (97.8°F). The heart rate is stable between 77 and 117 beats per minute. The blood pressure is on the lower side, ranging from 103/55 to 130/72 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 19 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 100%.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, slightly low hematocrit level of 35.3%, and normal platelet count of 208 K/uL. The creatinine level is within normal range at 0.9 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are below the cutoff value of 0.01, indicating no cardiac damage. Glucose levels are consistently around 150 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's altered mental status, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, or glycemic control issues due to high glucose levels. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent these"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, paraplegia, significant psychiatric history, and mental retardation. She presents with exacerbation of asthma/COPD, severe obstructive physiology, and respiratory distress. She has shown improvement on current treatment with steroids, antibiotics, and continuous nebulizers.

The patient also has a history of seizures, for which phenytoin was previously prescribed but the level was subtherapeutic. The patient will resume her home dose of Keppra (Levetiracetam).

Psychiatric issues are noted, with a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Emotional Features & Personality Disorder NOS. The patient will continue with her home psychiatric regimen.

The patient experienced chest pain, which is likely due to respiratory distress and work of breathing. Enzyme cycling is being done with a low suspicion for cardiac etiology.

Hypertension was observed, and the patient's blood pressure medications, atenolol and lisinopril, were held overnight. It is planned to restart these medications.

Abdominal tenderness is noted, which the patient considers as her baseline. This could be related to previous discharge summary findings. Liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase levels will be checked due to previous elevation. Lactate elevation is attributed to the work of breathing, and the abdominal exam will be closely monitored.

The patient is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous he"

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a chief complaint of acute respiratory distress. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving continuous nebs, steroids, Azithro, and low-dose morphine for comfort. The patient's condition has shown some improvement, and the plan is to try weaning the dose of continuous albuterol then space to q1 hr nebs.

The patient has multiple allergies, including Zosyn (Intravenous), Quinolones, Ceftriaxone, Flagyl (Oral), Keppra (Oral), and Clindamycin. The last dose of antibiotics given was Clindamycin on 07/31/2176 at 10:00 PM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), current temperature of 35.9 C (96.7 F), heart rate ranging from 76-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/40-116/72 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 15-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following:
- Flowsheet data as of 08/01/2176 at 10:34 AM shows that the patient has received a total input of 717 mL since 12 AM, with 546 mL being intravenous fluids, 400 mL of oral intake, 440 mL of total output, 768 mL of urine output, and 435 mL of blood products transfused.
- The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and an ABG result of 7.30/43/91/19/-4.
- Physical examination findings include the patient sitting up in bed, coughing at times, dry oral mucosa, tachypnea, diffuse expiratory wheezes, pedal edema, and conversant in short sentences.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (14.6), slightly low hemoglobin (10.1 g/dL), normal platelet count (208), elevated creatinine (0.9), and other abnormal lab values such as elevated lactate, low potassium, and low calcium levels.
- Imaging results are not provided in the note.
- The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except where noted above.

The patient's assessment includes altered mental status (not delirium), severe asthma exacerbation with hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and lactic acidosis. The patient's pain control is also mentioned, including acute pain and chronic pain.

The plan includes continuing continuous nebs, steroids, Azithro, and low-dose morphine for comfort. The patient's home phenytoin dose needs to be restarted, and her home medications need to be addressed. Other remaining issues will be discussed with the housestaff.

Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and communication are also noted in the plan. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU, and the total time spent with the patient is 35 minutes."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female who presented to the ICU with acute respiratory distress. She has multiple known drug allergies, including Zosyn, quinolones, ceftriaxone, and Flagyl. The patient has been receiving continuous nebulizations and various medications for severe asthma exacerbation, including steroids, Azithro, and a low dose of morphine. She also requires phenytoin for seizure management.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, and respiratory rate within the normal range. Oxygen saturation is at 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is tachycardic but has a sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 717 mL and output of 768 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheezes, pedal edema, and appropriate mentation. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for occasional coughing.

Laboratory results indicate a slightly low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated white blood cell count, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Severe asthma exacerbation with hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and lactic acidosis. The patient is starting to respond to treatment but still requires continuous nebulizations and steroids. The plan is to wean the dose of continuous albuterol.

   Total time spent:
","The patient presented with acute respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. The patient is on continuous nebulizers and multiple antibiotics due to severe asthma exacerbation, hypoxemia, and lactic acidosis. The patient's mental status is altered but not delirium, and there is a need for pain control. 

The patient has an altered mental status, asthma, and acute/chronic pain. The plan includes continuous nebulizers, steroids, azithromycin, and low-dose morphine for comfort. The patient should be closely monitored for impending respiratory failure, as indicated by the improvement in ABG values.

Other interventions include restarting home phenytoin for seizures and confirming the patient's do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth), with bowel regularity, and has a peripheral intravenous line.

The patient requires critical care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, sepsis, pneumonia, and further deterioration of mental status. Close monitoring and appropriate management of the patient's condition are crucial."

   exacerbation of asthma/COPD. Resp distress significantly improved on
   continuous nebs.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt presented with severe obstructive
   physiology. Pt with Hx of asthma +/- COPD. Possiblity of viral URI
   preceding current presentation. Improved on current Tx with steroids,
   Abx, Cont nebs.
   - Cont azithro (5day course), clinda (7day course) (given PCN allergy),
   f/u Cx
   - droplet precaustions, R/O flu and other resp viruses
   - solumedrol 125mg tid, will eventually taper and then resume home

   - morphine [**3-6**] q6h prn, suspect strong anxiety component
   - serial ABGs.
   - Decreased nebs to Albuterol/Atrovent q4hrs.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: The non-gap metabolic acidosis in this patient is
   likely in part due to her urostomy.  This diversion can result in a
   hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to transporters in the colonic
   lumen absorbing Cl- and the associated secretion of bicarb.  This
   coupled with the elevated lactate may explain the acidosis.
   # Hx of seizures: Phenytoin level now therapeutic on home dose.
   .
   #  Psych: Last diagnosis in recent OMR note: Adjustment Disorder with
   Mixed Emotional Features & Personality Disorder NOS. Continuing home
   regimen derived from recent discharge.  Pts resp status has improved
   such that she is able to speak and interact.  Appreciate psych recs.
- If patient becomes psychotic on steroids will increase seroquel to 50mg QID an
d may increase further to 100mg QID.  If needed may add haldol 2-5mg IV BID PRN.
   # Chest Pain: Likely from resp distress and work of breathing,
   especially given strong assoc with cough. 3 sets CE negative, pain
   unchanged.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, paraplegia, significant psychiatric history, and questionable mental retardation. She presented with exacerbation of asthma/COPD, severe obstructive physiology, and respiratory distress. Her condition improved on continuous nebulizers. The patient also has a history of seizures versus pseudoseizures, metabolic acidosis, and chest pain. She is currently experiencing altered mental status, asthma, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), and hypertension. The patient has an urostomy, which may contribute to her metabolic acidosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to her asthma/COPD exacerbation. If not properly managed, it could lead to further respiratory failure and hypoxemia.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis may worsen if the underlying causes, such as urostomy and lactate elevation from work of breathing, are not addressed.
3. Seizures: Although the patient's phenytoin level is therapeutic, there is still a risk of seizures due to her history of seizures versus pseudoseizures. Continuous monitoring and appropriate seizure management should be maintained.
4. Psychiatric Issues: The patient's psychiatric history and current medication regimen indicate potential psychiatric complications, including anxiety, agitation, and psychotic episodes. Close monitoring and adherence to the prescribed psychiatric medications are essential"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yo F w/ spina bifida, paraplegia, significant psych Hx, question of
   mental retardation, hx of seizure vs pseudoseizure, PRESENTS WITH
   exacerbation of asthma/COPD. Resp distress significantly improved on
   continuous nebs.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt presented with severe obstructive
   physiology. Pt with Hx of asthma +/- COPD. Possiblity of viral URI
   preceding current presentation. Improved on current Tx with steroids,
   Abx, Cont nebs.
   - Cont azithro (5day course), clinda (7day course) (given PCN allergy),
   f/u Cx
   - solumedrol 125mg tid.  Will begin taper today->60mg Prednisone PO
   then resume home advair as we approach end of taper.
   - morphine [**3-6**] q6h prn, suspect strong anxiety component
   - serial ABGs.
   - Decreased nebs to Albuterol/Atrovent q4hrs.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: The non-gap metabolic acidosis in this patient is
   likely in part due to her urostomy.  This diversion can result in a
   hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to transporters in the colonic
   lumen absorbing Cl- and the associated secretion of bicarb.  This
   coupled with the elevated lactate may explain the acidosis.
   # Hx of seizures: Phenytoin level now therapeutic on home dose.
   .
   #  Psych: Last diagnosis in recent OMR note: Adjustment Disorder with
   Mixed Emotional Features & Personality Disorder NOS. Continuing home
   regimen derived from recent discharge.  Pts resp status has improved
   such that she is able to speak and interact.  Appreciate psych recs.
- If patient becomes psychotic on steroids will increase seroquel to 50mg QID an
d may increase further to 100mg QID.  If needed may add haldol 2-5mg IV BID PRN.
   # Chest Pain: Likely from resp distress, work of breathing, especially
   given strong assoc with cough. 3 sets CE negative, pain unchanged.
   .
   # HTN: holding atenolol and lisinopril given normotension and acute
   presentation, plan to restart once stable from resp standpoint
   .
   # Diffuse abdominal tenderness: Per pt this is her baseline. C/w recent
   discharge summary. Lactate elevation attributable to work of breathing,
   but will monitor abdominal exam.  Also may be attributed to urostomy
   (see below for care).
   # Ostomy care:
   -Cleanse stoma/peristomal skin with warm water, pat dry.
   -Apply no-sting barrier wipe.
   -Placed [**Location (un) 7477**] 1 piece convexity pouching system, with [**Last Name (un) **]
   cohesive seal, and connected to bedside drainage
   #Eosinophilia
   -Pt has had chronic eosinophilia which may be related to
   antihypertensives and could be trigger for asthma exacerbation.  After
   off steroids will need to have diff checked by PCP.

   Disposition: Call out to floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, paraplegia, psychiatric history, and question of mental retardation. She presented with an exacerbation of asthma/COPD, severe obstructive physiology, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition improved on continuous nebulizers, steroids, and antibiotics.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's presentation with severe obstructive physiology and history of asthma/COPD suggests a potential exacerbation of her respiratory condition. Monitoring and managing her respiratory status will be important to prevent further respiratory distress.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The non-gap metabolic acidosis in this patient is likely due to her urostomy, which can result in a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. This coupled with elevated lactate levels may explain the acidosis. Monitoring and addressing the underlying cause of the metabolic acidosis will be necessary.

3. History of Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and her phenytoin level is now therapeutic on her home dose. Monitoring the phenytoin levels and ensuring therapeutic levels are maintained will be important to prevent seizure recurrence.

4. Psychiatric Issues: The patient has a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features and personality disorder NOS. Continuing the home regimen derived from recent discharge and considering psychotropic medication recommendations will be important to manage her psychiatric symptoms"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, paraplegia, significant psychiatric history, and question of mental retardation. She presented with respiratory distress, which significantly improved on continuous nebulizers. The patient has a history of asthma/COPD and is currently being treated with steroids, antibiotics, and continuous nebulizers. She also has a urostomy, which may contribute to her non-gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's past medical history includes seizures, for which she is on phenytoin therapy, and psychiatric conditions such as adjustment disorder and personality disorder NOS. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presented with severe obstructive physiology and has a history of asthma/COPD. Continuous nebulizers have improved her respiratory distress, but she may still be at risk for future episodes if her asthma/COPD is not well controlled.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to her urostomy. This can result in a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. It is important to monitor her acid-base balance and correct any electrolyte imbalances.
3. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizures, and her phenytoin levels are now therapeutic on her home dose. Close monitoring of seizure activity and phenytoin levels is necessary to ensure adequate seizure control.

   46 yo F w/ spina bifida, paraplegia, significant psych Hx, question of
   mental retardation, hx of seizure vs pseudoseizure, PRESENTS WITH
   exacerbation of asthma/COPD. Resp distress significantly improved on
   continuous nebs.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt presented with severe obstructive
   physiology. Pt with Hx of asthma +/- COPD. Possiblity of viral URI
   preceding current presentation. Improved on current Tx with steroids,
   Abx, Cont nebs.
   - Cont azithro (5day course), clinda (7day course) (given PCN allergy),
   f/u Cx
   - droplet precaustions, R/O flu and other resp viruses
   - solumedrol 125mg tid, will eventually taper and then resume home
   advair
   - morphine [**3-6**] q6h prn, suspect strong anxiety component
   - serial ABGs.
   - Decreased nebs to Albuterol/Atrovent q4hrs.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: The non-gap metabolic acidosis in this patient is
   likely in part due to her urostomy.  This diversion can result in a
   hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to transporters in the colonic
   lumen absorbing Cl- and the associated secretion of bicarb.  This
   coupled with the elevated lactate may explain the acidosis.
   # Hx of seizures: Phenytoin level now therapeutic on home dose.
   .
   #  Psych: Last diagnosis in recent OMR note: Adjustment Disorder with
   Mixed Emotional Features & Personality Disorder NOS. Continuing home
   regimen derived from recent discharge.  Pts resp status has improved
   such that she is able to speak and interact.  Appreciate psych recs.
- If patient becomes psychotic on steroids will increase seroquel to 50mg QID an
d may increase further to 100mg QID.  If needed may add haldol 2-5mg IV BID PRN.
   # Chest Pain: Likely from resp distress, work of breathing, especially
   given strong assoc with cough. 3 sets CE negative, pain unchanged.
   .
   # HTN: holding atenolol and lisinopril given normotension and acute
   presentation, plan to restart once stable from resp standpoint
   .
   # Diffuse abdominal tenderness: Per pt this is her baseline. C/w recent
   discharge summary. Lactate elevation attributable to work of breathing,
   but will monitor abdominal exam.  Also may be attributed to urostomy
   (see below for care).
   # Ostomy care:
   -Cleanse stoma/peristomal skin with warm water, pat dry.
   -Apply no-sting barrier wipe.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ASTHMA
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   46 yo F w/ spina bifida, paraplegia, significant psych Hx, question of
   mental retardation, hx of seizure vs pseudoseizure, PRESENTS WITH
   exacerbation of asthma/COPD. Resp distress significantly improved on
   continuous nebs.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Pt presented with severe obstructive
   physiology. Pt with Hx of asthma +/- COPD. Possiblity of viral URI
   preceding current presentation. Improved on current Tx with steroids,
   Abx, Cont nebs.
   - Cont azithro (5day course), clinda (7day course) (given PCN allergy),
   f/u Cx
   - droplet precaustions, R/O flu and other resp viruses
   - solumedrol 125mg tid, will eventually taper and then resume home
   advair
   - morphine [**3-6**] q6h prn, suspect strong anxiety component
   - serial ABGs.
   - Decrease continuous nebs to 5mg/hr for 2 hrs and if doing well will
   decrease to q1hr nebs.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: The non-gap metabolic acidosis in this patient is
   likely in part due to her urostomy.  This diversion can result in a
   hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to transporters in the colonic
   lumen absorbing Cl- and the associated secretion of bicarb.  This
   coupled with the elevated lactate may explain the acidosis.
   - Consider starting patient on PO sodium bicarb.  This is a chronic
   state for this patient and therefore an aggressive correction not
   warranted.
   .
   # Hx of seizures: Phenytoin level subtherapeutic. Resuming home dose.
   .
   #  Psych: Last diagnosis in recent OMR note: Adjustment Disorder with
   Mixed Emotional Features & Personality Disorder NOS. Continuing home
   regimen derived from recent discharge.  Pts resp status has improved
   such that she is able to speak and interact.  Will have Psych c/s to
   eval patient.
   .
   # Chest Pain: Likely from resp distress and work of breathing,
   especially given strong assoc with cough. 3 sets CE negative, pain
   unchanged.
   .
   # HTN: holding atenolol and lisinopril given normotension and acute
   presentation, plan to restart once stable from resp standpoint
   .
   # Diffuse abdominal tenderness: Per pt this is her baseline. C/w recent
   discharge summary. Will check LFTs and lipase as previously elevated.
   Lactate elevation attribuatlbe to work of breathing, but will monitor
   abdominal exam closely.
   # Ostomy care:
   -Cleanse stoma/peristomal skin with warm water, pat dry.
   -Apply no-sting barrier wipe.
   -Placed [**Location (un) 7477**] 1 piece convexity pouching system, with [**Last Name (un) **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, paraplegia, significant psychiatric history, and questionable mental retardation. She presents with exacerbation of asthma/COPD, severe obstructive physiology, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition has improved on continuous nebulizers (nebs). She also has altered mental status, pain control issues, and a history of seizures versus pseudoseizures. The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely due to her urostomy, and an elevated lactate level. Other findings include hypertension, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and ostomy care concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of asthma/COPD and severe obstructive physiology indicate a high risk for recurrent respiratory distress. Continuous nebs have helped improve her condition, but she may still be prone to exacerbations.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis is likely due to her urostomy, which can result in a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. This condition may require ongoing management and monitoring.

3. Seizure Activity: The patient's history of seizures versus pseudoseizures needs to be carefully evaluated. Phenytoin levels are subtherapeutic, and the patient's home dose should be resumed. Monitoring for seizure activity is essential.

4. Psychiatric Issues: The patient has a psychiatric history, including adjustment disorder with mixed"
