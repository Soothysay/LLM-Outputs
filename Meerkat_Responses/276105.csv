","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 26-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multi lumen insertion. The patient has allergies to iodine, which resulted in hives and rash. He has been receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and meropenem, since admission. The patient is on multiple infusions, including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the insertion of the multi lumen and bronchoscopy. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 70 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 119/47-144/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 10 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,605-2,314 mL and output of 5-585 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,600-1,729 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The patient was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and septic shock.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, suspected hypoxic respiratory failure with airway collapse, bronchoscopy revealing friable airways, bronchomalacia, mucous, and old blood. The patient also has septic shock, possibly due to pneumonia or line sepsis, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Other medical complications that can arise include cardiogenic shock due to the patient's history of CHF and poor left ventricular function. The patient's cardiac function is currently preserved but may deteriorate if not properly managed. Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be chronic or related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to underlying insulin resistance and worsened by steroid treatment.

The patient also has hypernatremia, anemia, and chronic kidney disease. The anemia could be multifactorial, including CLL, CKD, anemia of chronic disease (ACD), and iron/b12 deficiency. The patient's CLL may"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently on mechanical ventilation with full vent support. He is also receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of severe hemorrhagic aspiration pneumonia. Continued support with mechanical ventilation and bronchodilators will be required to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient has septic shock, likely due to pneumonia, line sepsis, or translocation of skin flora. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy are needed to manage the infection and stabilize the patient's hemodynamics.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: Although the patient's cardiac function appears preserved, there is a possibility of cardiogenic shock due to ischemic heart disease. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and echocardiogram trends will be necessary to assess cardiac function.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which needs to be managed with insulin therapy.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic with a free water"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He was admitted for respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, airway collapse, bronchomalacia, mucous, and old blood. He also has septic shock with intravascular volume depletion, preserved left ventricular function, and clear right lung field on chest X-ray. There are concerns about recurrent lymphoma or another primary malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further hypoxia and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock could progress, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels may cause cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may result in dehydration or neurological complications.
5. Cardiac Issues: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest possible cardiac damage, which could worsen and lead to cardiogenic shock.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's impaired renal function may deteriorate, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, causing fatigue"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and previous tracheostomy. He was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), septic shock, and possible line sepsis. He also has thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient has been sedated with fentanyl and versed, and his code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. Continued support with mechanical ventilation will be necessary, along with weaning FiO2 to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.

2. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which may be caused by aspiration pneumonia, line sepsis, or translocation of skin flora. Pressors should be continued to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and antibiotics (levofloxacin, meropenem, vancomycin) should be administered to cover both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including pseud"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and recurrent lymphoma. The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5 cmH2O. He is also receiving IV antibiotics, vasopressors, and hydrocortisone. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to the respiratory failure. Continued support with mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient is diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to pneumonia (presumed healthcare-associated pneumonia). Appropriate antimicrobial therapy and source control measures should be continued.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be chronic or acute-on-chronic. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and considering transfusion if platelets fall below 30,000/mm3.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of approximately 3L. Correction of the sodium imbalance should be done carefully to prevent osm"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib) on coumadin, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a pacemaker. The patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and septic shock. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is on full ventilator support with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 97%. Bronchoscopy revealed friable airways, bronchomalacia, mucous, and old blood. 
- Septic shock: The patient was restarted on pressors since this morning. Presumed pneumonia based on chest X-ray and OSH records. The patient also has severe hemorrhagic aspiration pneumonia. Other potential sources of infection include line sepsis or translocation of skin flora. 
- Hyperglycemia: Now well-controlled, so discontinuing insulin gtt and starting SSI.
- Hypernatremia: Free water deficit ~ 3L, unable to correct yesterday due to lack of NG tube. OG tube now in place will correct [**12-30**] in 24 hours. Free H2O bolus 250 cc q4h.
- AFib: Holding B-blocker in the setting of hypotension. Holding coumadin as low level of likely dysfunctional platelets.
- CHF: Holding diuretics, afterload reducers [**1-30**] hypotension.
- CKD: Creatinine at bilateral levels, trending.
- Anemia: At/near bilateral levels, has had aranesp in the past. Suspect multifactorial (CLL, CKD, ACD, Fe/B12-deficiency). No s/sx bleeding. T&S, guaiac stools, x-fuse for <21%.
- CLL: Leukocytosis likely in the setting of severe infection; lymphocytosis is chronic. Consider onc C/S re: cell counts, aranesp, possibility of recurrence/new primary in lung. For now, will notify attending physician who cared for pt in past.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and the ventilator settings need to be carefully monitored and adjusted to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Septic shock: The patient is in septic shock, and there is a need to continue aggressive treatment with antibiotics, fluids, and pressors to maintain hemodynamic stability.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has severe hemorrhagic aspiration pneumonia, which requires appropriate antim"

   Tracheostomy and CLL now admit with sepsis and persistent hypotension.
   He has primary source remaining to be defined and treated fully and at
   this point retains a significant risk for nosocomial infection and skin
   source certainly possible.
   Sepsis--Has had WBC improving and no significant recurrence of lactic
   acidosis which is likely significant. His primary insult is likely
   pneuomonia and complication by left sided lung collapse and possible
   traumatic left chest injury raising question of hemothorax.
   Hydrocortisone/Levophed--levophed off this morning, will taper steroids
   to off over [**5-4**] day course
   Vanco/Meropenem/Levoflox-
   -IVF bolus as needed
   -CVL to be relaced
   -Pacer increased to 80 bpm
   Respiratory Failure-
   This is hypoxemic respiratory failure and has likely left sided
   infiltrate and collapse being a driving factor
   CT scan to evaluate for extend of pleural fluid collection and will
   need CT today to evaluate extent and source of left sided
   collapse/restriction.
   -Continue with A/C support
   Thrombocytopenia -
   -This is a reasonably quick drop over past two days
   -Will need full investigation as to source given acute decrease
   -Will start with DIC labs to evaluate
   -Has persistently low PLTS at this time
doubt new insult outside of

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of CAD, CHF, CRF, A-Fib, and previous procedures such as a pacemaker and tracheostomy. He was admitted with sepsis and persistent hypotension, with the primary source of infection still being defined. The patient's condition has improved, but there are ongoing concerns about nosocomial infection and skin source. 

24-hour events include a failed attempt at changing the patient's line due to difficulty accessing the vein, consultation with interventional radiology for aid in catheter placement, discussion of goals of care, discontinuation of pressors, administration of antibiotics, and adjustments to the patient's medications.

The patient's vital signs show a low temperature, low blood pressure, and normal heart rate. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, FiO2 at 50%, and PEEP at 5 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and other relevant information. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin, with diminished breath sounds on the left side, symmetric chest expansion, and soft abdomen."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a tracheostomy. He was admitted for management of respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has been on full ventilatory support and is receiving multiple intravenous medications, including pressors to maintain blood pressure and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. He also has a history of cancer and is undergoing evaluation for potential recurrence or new primary malignancy. The patient's current condition includes diffuse ground-glass opacities on chest CT, moderate right and small left pleural effusions, resolving collapse of the left lung with secretions, tracheostomy with secretions above the level of the stoma, and massive biatrial enlargement on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). He has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 50"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and previous CABG surgery. The patient was transferred for management of respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock, potential cardiogenic shock, and possible malignancy. The patient is on full vent support and is being weaned off FiO2 to maintain sats >92%, art pH > 7.2. A chest CT has been ordered to evaluate for loculated effusion, empyema, or pulmonary embolism. The patient is also being treated for suspected pneumonia, line sepsis, or translocation of skin flora with broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to airway collapse, bronchomalacia, mucous, and old blood. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the patient's condition worsens or if there is an inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is already in septic shock, and there is a risk of further deterioration if the infection is not adequately controlled or if the patient's immune response weakens.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a tracheostomy. He was admitted for management of respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, septic shock, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure due to airway collapse, bronchomalacia, mucous, and old blood. He requires full ventilator support and is being weaned off FiO2 to maintain saturation levels above 92%.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: There is a suspicion of cardiogenic shock due to the patient's past medical history of CAD and CHF. However, the patient appears intravascularly volume depleted with preserved left ventricular function.

3. Septic Shock: The patient is presumed to have septic shock based on chest X-ray findings, OSH records, and bronchoscopy results showing severe hemorrhagic aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being treated with high-dose steroids, vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

4. Thrombocytopen"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**7-19**] Chest Ct
   1. New diffuse ground-glass opacities, likely due to hydrostatic edema.
   Less
   likely consideration is a diffuse infectious process.
   2. New moderate right and small left pleural effusions, difficult to
   assess for simple fluid versus hemorrhagic density due to extensive
   streak
   artifact from suboptimal arm positioning.
   3. Resolving collapse of the left lung with apparent intraluminal
   secretions
   in the left main stem bronchus and atelectasis versus a small focus of
   consolidation in the lingula. Unchanged rounded atelectasis on the left
   lower
   lobe.
   3. Tracheostomy in place with secretions in the trachea above the level
   of
   the stoma.
   [**7-19**] TTE - Mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional and global LV
   systolic function. RV systolic function cannot be accurately assessed.
   Moderate mitral and trace aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. Massive biatrial enlargement.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-5-23**], the
   rhythm now appears to be atrial fibrillation. The other findings are
   similar.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib) on coumadin, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The patient was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and septic shock. He is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has evidence of diffuse ground-glass opacities and moderate right and small left pleural effusions on chest CT. These findings, along with the clinical presentation of respiratory failure, suggest the possibility of ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation parameters, and fluid balance is necessary.

2. Sepsis and Septic Shock: The patient remains pressor-dependent, indicating ongoing hypotension despite the administration of vasopressors. There is a suspicion of pneumonia (PNA), gram-positive cocci (GPC), and gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum. The source of infection may be aspiration, line sepsis, or translocation of skin flora. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, source control measures, and hemodynamic support is essential.

3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's history of CAD and previous CABG puts him at risk"

   1. New diffuse ground-glass opacities, likely due to hydrostatic edema.
   Less
   likely consideration is a diffuse infectious process.
   2. New moderate right and small left pleural effusions, difficult to
   assess for simple fluid versus hemorrhagic density due to extensive
   streak
   artifact from suboptimal arm positioning.
   3. Resolving collapse of the left lung with apparent intraluminal
   secretions
   in the left main stem bronchus and atelectasis versus a small focus of
   consolidation in the lingula. Unchanged rounded atelectasis on the left
   lower
   lobe.
   3. Tracheostomy in place with secretions in the trachea above the level
   of
   the stoma.
   [**7-19**] TTE - Mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional and global LV
   systolic function. RV systolic function cannot be accurately assessed.
   Moderate mitral and trace aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. Massive biatrial enlargement.

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a tracheostomy. He was transferred for management of respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to septic shock, collapse of the left lung with pleural effusion, and hemorrhagic aspiration pneumonia. He is also experiencing septic shock, presumed polymicrobial including Pseudomonas, and has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other medical complications include thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, CHF, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is secondary to septic shock and the presence of diffuse ground-glass opacities on chest CT. Management includes low-Vt ventilation, maintaining plateau pressures, weaning FiO2 to maintain saturation above 92%, and evaluating for loculated effusion, empyema, or pulmonary embolism (PE) once stable.

   to achieve even that level of stability.
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with ARDS based on imaging findings and a low P/F ratio. The patient's respiratory status is poor with a compliance of 20, and he has a Pplat of 25. He requires ventilatory support with low Vt and titration of PEEP to optimize oxygenation. The underlying pneumonia is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Levophed is being used for hemodynamic support, and hydrocortisone has been initiated. The patient's thrombocytopenia is persistent, likely due to his CLL diagnosis. The patient's code status is DNR, and he is expected to have a prolonged stay in a fully supported setting.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged stay in the ICU: The patient's critical condition and poor respiratory status may require a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and low compliance pose a risk for further deterioration in respiratory function, potentially leading to severe hypoxemia and the need for increased ventilatory support.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock indicates an ongoing infection, which needs to be aggressively managed to prevent further complications such as organ dysfunction or septic shock recurrence.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's persistent low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications,"

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, complete heart block with a permanent pacemaker, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He was admitted to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, collapse effusion/hemothorax, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia, and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is in the setting of septic shock, collapse effusion/hemothorax, and less likely cardiogenic shock. The main plan includes low-Vt ventilation, maintaining plateau pressures <25 cmH2O, increasing PEEP to improve collapse, and decreasing FiO2 to 40% while maintaining a PO2 >60.

2. Septic Shock: The patient remains pressor-dependent and presumed pneumonia (aspiration), Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Gram-negative rods (GNR) in sputum. Other possible sources include line sepsis or translocation of skin flora. The treatment plan includes LR boluses to maintain"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, complete heart block with pacemaker, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, arterial line replacement, and changes in medications and pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS in the setting of septic shock. There is a concern for collapse effusion/hemothorax, but it is less likely to be cardiogenic shock as the left ventricular function is preserved. The goal is to maintain plateau pressures <25 cmH2O, consider increasing PEEP to improve lung collapse, and decrease FiO2 to 40% while maintaining a PO2 >60.

2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient remains pressor-dependent and is presumed to have pneumonia (aspiration), gram-positive cocci (GPC), and gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum. There is also a consideration of line sepsis or translocation of skin flora. The patient has been treated with high-dose steroids, which may have contributed to hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   85M with cad, ckd, afib, chb with pacemaker, presents with respiratory
   failure likely from multilobar pna, s/p trach in [**Male First Name (un) **], presented
   in sepsis, now with increasing leukocytosis and increasing requirement
   of pressors, worsening metabolic acidosis. likely etiology is
   persistent sepsis is unclear but includes persistent pna, ?empyema,
   ?abdominal source given high residuals. differential with lymphocytosis
   suggestive of primary heme malignant process given history of cll:
   -continue current vent settings; adequate ventilation and oxygenation
   -continue meropenem, vanco, levo
   -start flagyl empirically for c.diff given rising wbc, new abdominal
   symptioms
   -will need to discuss risks and benefits of thoracentesis / chest tube
   placement if indicated
   -family meeting today to reassess goal of care
   I was present with team on this day for full discussion of patient
   clinical course and would agree in full with the findings of the note
   as described above
I would add the following.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Patient with tracheostomy tube in good position
   -Continues will full ventilator support as delivered in volume cycled
   ventilation
   -Will continue to trial decrease in FIO2.
   -He does have mild improvement in P/F ratio today with continued
   support
   2)Sepsis-Worsening hypotension overnight with increasing doses of
   Levoflox needed.  Fluid bolus had incomplete response and Levophed
   doses were increased.
   Continue with broad spectrum ABX
   Will need to continue search for possible source
persistent
   leukocytosis is of concern
   3)Leukocytosis-
   -On repeat smear there is concern raised for atypical cells
   -Will pursue full Heme evaluation to consider possible hematologic
   malignancy

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with multiple medical problems who presented to the ICU in sepsis and respiratory failure. He has been sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, is on mechanical ventilation, and requires pressors for blood pressure support. His white blood cell count is increasing, indicating ongoing infection. The source of sepsis is unclear, but possibilities include pneumonia, empyema, or an abdominal source. There is also a concern for a hematologic malignancy due to lymphocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure:
- The patient will require continued ventilator support as delivered in volume cycled ventilation.
- There is a need to continue decreasing FIO2 and improve the patient's PaO2/FIO2 ratio.

2. Sepsis:
- The patient's condition is worsening, with increasing doses of Levofloxacin needed to control blood pressure.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued to address the ongoing infection.
- A thorough search for the source of sepsis should be pursued.

3. Leukocytosis:
- Repeat blood smears have raised concerns about atypical cells, indicating a possible hematologic malignancy.
- A full evaluation for hematologic malignancy should be conducted.

4. Nutrition:
- Tube feeds are currently held due to high residuals.
- Alternative nutrition plans should be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He presented to the hospital in septic shock and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He is currently in the ICU on ventilatory support and multiple vasopressors. His condition has been worsening, with increasing leukocytosis, worsening metabolic acidosis, and the need for higher doses of vasopressors. The patient's blood cultures have shown growth of MRSA, and he has been started on empiric antibiotics including meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. He is also receiving treatment for Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation and worsening condition indicate ongoing sepsis. This can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and potentially death if not adequately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if the ventilatory support is inadequate or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
3. Kidney Injury: The patient's CKD puts him at risk for further kidney injury due to the use of nephrotoxic drugs, hypotension from vasopressor therapy, or acute tubular necrosis secondary to sepsis.
4. Infection Control Issues: Given the patient's colonization or infection with MRSA and C. difficile, proper infection control measures should be implemented to prevent transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD and AFib increases his risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
6. Multilobar Pneumonia: The patient's presentation suggests the possibility of multilobar pneumonia, which can lead to severe sepsis and septic shock.
7. Empyema: The patient may have developed empyema as a complication of pneumonia, which could require drainage procedures such as thoracentesis or chest tube placement.
8. Abdominal Source of Infection: The high residuals from the patient's tube feeds raise the suspicion of an abdominal source of infection, which could be due to diverticulitis, perforated viscus, or intra-abdominal abscess.
9. CLL Transformation: The patient's history of CLL and lymphocytosis suggests the possibility of transformation to a more aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder.
10. Ethical Considerations: Given the patient's advanced age and critical condition, discussions regarding goals of care and end-of-life decisions are necessary. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status, which needs to be respected while considering the most appropriate interventions."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient's current condition includes severe septic shock, ARDS, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and anemia. The patient is intubated and sedated, with inadequate gut function. Multiple organ dysfunction is present, and the patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS and septic shock. The need for continued mechanical ventilation may be necessary, along with careful management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock requires ongoing management with appropriate antibiotic therapy, fluid resuscitation, and hemodynamic support. Monitoring for signs of persistent hypotension and organ dysfunction is essential.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed appropriately. Monitoring renal function and ensuring adequate fluid balance and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a tracheostomy. He was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and septic shock.

The patient remains pressor-dependent and is suspected to have pneumonia (aspiration), Gram-positive cocci (GPC), and Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the sputum. There is also a possibility of line sepsis or translocation of skin flora. He was previously treated with high-dose steroids at another facility, which may be contributing to hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/50 to 131/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes, and PEEP is being increased to improve lung collapse and allow for a decrease in FiO2 to 40%. Albuterol nebs are given as needed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with 50% lymphocytes, elevated creatinine levels, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and tracheostomy. He was admitted for management of respiratory failure and septic shock.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated but responds to verbal stimuli. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to septic shock, with a persistent right-sided effusion. He is on low-tidal volume ventilation to maintain plateau pressures below 25 cmH2O and is being considered for thoracentesis to rule out empyema.

He is also diagnosed with septic shock, presumed aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and possible empyema. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and meropenem. He is also being treated for Clostridium difficile infection with Flagyl.

He has leukocytosis with a high percentage of lymphocytes, which could be due to CLL or persistent infection. He is being treated with antibiotics for PNA and Flagyl for C. difficile.

The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with anuria and fractional excretion of sodium (FeNA) of 0.3, indicating pre-renal azotemia. He is being given fluid challenges"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with admission with spesis and respiratory failure now with
   persistent hypotension despite optimal fluid management and
   antibiotics.
   1)Sepsis
   Levophed at persistent doses
   Hydocorisone
   Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]/Levo/Flagyl
   CvO2=74 consistent with high output state
   Continue with ABX and hope to be able to eliminate infectious source
   with continued antibiotics
   Will tap effusion
   2)Respiratory Failure
Has had reasonable response to continued full
   support and will continue with management with
   -Wean FIO2
   -Continue to monitor ABG
s in response to wean in FIO2
   -Need to evaluate and try to tap effusion for diagnostic purposes but
   is unlikely to represent a mechanical disadvantage limiting weaning.
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Has slow worsening of renal failure and the source is quite likely
   worsening ATN in the setting of persistent sepsis and hypotension.
   -Check FeNA
   -Provide fluid challenge
   -Check Renal U/S if unrevealing and worsening seen.
   4)Leukocytosis-
   -Persistent elevation and Heme to evaluate smear and consider findings
   in light of acute infection.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been sedated and unable to provide any history. 

From the 24-hour events, it is noted that an arterial line was stopped on 07/21/2151 at 10:30 AM. A peripheral smear will be evaluated by hematology for possible smudge cells. The patient has allergies to iodine, with a previous reaction of hives and rash. The last dose of antibiotics administered was Levofloxacin on 07/21/2151 at 11:11 AM, followed by Meropenem at 08:15 PM on the same day, and Metronidazole on 07/22/2151 at 08:55 AM.

The patient is receiving several infusions, including Fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour, Midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour, and Norepinephrine at 0.18 mcg/kg/min. Additionally, the patient is receiving Pantoprazole (Protonix) as part of ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) at 36.4 degrees Celsius, current temperature (Tcurrent) at 35.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) at 80 bpm with a range of 76-82 bpm, blood pressure (BP) at 113/49 mmHg with a range of 65-"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), atrial fibrillation (AFib) on coumadin, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) status post pacemaker placement, and tracheostomy. The patient was transferred for management of respiratory failure and septic shock.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) in the setting of septic shock and collapse of the right lung effusion/hemothorax. There is also a persistent left-sided effusion. The plan includes low-Vt ventilation, increasing PEEP to improve collapse, decreasing FiO2 to maintain PO2 >60, considering thoracentesis to rule out empyema, and albuterol nebs as needed.

- Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient is presumed to have aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with possible empyema due to persistent effusion, hypotension, and leukocytosis. The plan includes NS boluses to maintain CVP 8-10, replacing arterial line, titrating levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, adding levo/[Last Name] (day 6) for double coverage against pseudomon"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic hepatitis B with pacemaker, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a recent tracheostomy. The patient was transferred to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the setting of septic shock. This has resulted in collapse of the right lung with persistent effusion/hemothorax. The patient is being ventilated at low-Vt with a goal of maintaining plateau pressures <25 cmH2O. PEEP may be increased to improve lung collapse and allow for a decrease in FiO2 to 40% while maintaining a PO2 >60.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has a pseudomonal pneumonia that is causing septic shock. There is a persistent leukocytosis, hypotension, and possible empyema due to the persistent effusion. The patient is receiving NS boluses to maintain CVP 8-10, titrating levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, and levofloxacin will be started. Vancomycin will be discontinued, and hydrocortisone will be continued.

3. Leukocytosis: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive airway disease (CAD) who presents with respiratory failure and septic shock, likely due to pneumonia. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a medical history. 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. He is on multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and levofloxacin). The patient's condition is described as very poor on arrival to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/55 mmHg to 122/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The physical examination reveals clear breath sounds anteriorly, no jugular venous distention, warm skin with a rash, and no overt signs of abuse or pain. The patient is unable to stand due to muscle wasting.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 73,000/uL, elevated lactate levels, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures were obtained on 07/22/2151 at 02:30 PM. Imaging studies have not"

   I was physically present with the resident team and fellow on this day
   and would agree with the content of this note in full.  I would
   emphasize that he has continued and presistent sepsis with incomplete
   response.  This has been a course of continued decline and has now
   worsening hypotensiona and persistent respiratory failure and in this
   setting his pressor requirements have remained.  In addition he has had
   continued worsening of his renal function consistent with further
   worsening of multi-organ system failure.

   -Continue with full A/C support
   -No role for wean of FIO2
   Acute Renal Failure-
   -Likely ATN from sepsis
   -Patient with continued decline over time despite optimal Rx
   -Willl check urine lytes and continue with fluid bolus.
   ICU-Pt is DNR at this time and will need to continue discussion of
   current goals of care which are clarified as no escalation of care.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive airways disease (CAD) who presents with respiratory failure and septic shock, likely from pneumonia. He has been in very poor condition since arriving in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/55 to 122/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, and antibiotics such as vancomycin, levofloxacin, meropenem, and metronidazole. He is also on a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. His blood cultures were taken on 07/22/2151 at 02:30 PM. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and renal function.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, no signs of poor dentition or endotracheal/NG/OG tubes, normal lymph nodes, and warm skin with a rash. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be sedated and unresponsive to commands.

The patient's imaging studies include chest X-rays taken on 07/19/2151 at 05:16 PM and 05:35 PM, among others. No additional imaging was performed.

The patient's assessment and plan include continued support for septic shock with continued fluids, holding pressor at current dose, and continuing vancomycin and levofloxacin. For respiratory failure, the patient will continue on current ventilator settings. Acute renal failure is likely due to sepsis, and the patient's renal function continues to worsen. The patient's condition has declined over time despite optimal treatment.

The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and will require continued discussion of current goals of care, as there will be no escalation of care. The patient is critically ill, and the ICU team will continue to provide supportive care."
