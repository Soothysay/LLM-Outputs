","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with acute polyarticular arthritis and acute renal failure. The patient's gout has been managed by avoiding treatment unless experiencing pain. He has received three units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to a drop in hemoglobin from 15 to 25. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/61 to 88/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and warm skin without rash. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, and demonstrates purposeful movement with normal tone. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium levels, and normal glucose levels. Renal function tests show an improvement in creatinine from 6.3 to 3.0 mg/dL after receiving 5 liters of fluids.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gout exacerbation: Since the patient has acute polyarticular arthritis likely due to gout, there is a risk of further joint inflammation and pain if not managed appropriately."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with acute polyarticular arthritis and acute renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving IV fluids. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 95/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no signs of distress. Physical examination reveals dilated pupils, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and warm skin without rash. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and normal tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (24.7 K/uL) and hematocrit (25.0%), with decreased platelet count (374), creatinine (3.0 mg/dL), and potassium (3.0 mEq/L). Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's urine output is adequate.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute polyarticular arthritis: The patient likely has gout, as indicated by the presence of needle-shaped crystals in the joint fluid and negative gram stain. However, due to acute renal failure, NSAIDs and colchicine will be avoided. Steroids will be held for now, per discussion with rheumatology, unless the patient complains of pain.
2. Leukemoid reaction: The patient may be experiencing a stress response due"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic alcohol use who presents with acute polyarticular arthritis, acute renal failure (ARF), metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, anemia, and leukocytosis. The patient's condition is attributed to gout/polyarticular arthritis and pain leading to decreased movement and poor oral intake for several days, resulting in ARF and electrolyte abnormalities.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/63 to 106/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen. The patient is hemodynamically stable with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, absent peripheral pulses, and warm left knee with bilateral proximal interphalangeal joint swelling. Neurological examination shows the patient to be attentive, oriented to time, place, and person, and able to follow simple commands.

Laboratory findings indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.7 K/u"

   53M with acute polyarticular arthritis and acute renal failure
   acute polyarticular arthritis: although joint distribution is not
   classic, polys and needle shaped crystals and negative gram stain on
   microscopy of joint fluid is c/w gout. given ARF, would avoid NSAIDs
   and colchicine. pt does not complain of pain at this time and says he
   wants to avoid medications; will hold steroids for now per discussio
   with rheum, not necessary to treat unless in pain.
   leukemoid reaction: suspect stress response from several days of acute
   inflammatory illness. Other DDX iclude infection vs malignancy, however
   history no consistent with thiese.
   -Continue to trend acute renal failure: BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1 and pt has
   not been taking adequate po x5 days, highly suggestive of prerenal
   azotemia. Cr down from 6.3 to 3.0 with 5L fluids, also consistent with
   prerenal azotemia.
   -IVF prn, otherwise encourage po
   anemia: Hct low despite significant volume contraction. macrocytic, no
   signs of active/obvious bleeding. guaiac all stools, but suspect
   alcohol bone marrow suppression + iron deficiency. plan to transfuse
   for Hct <21. will need outpt colonoscopy
   HTN: hold antihypertensives for now. restart once fully volume

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a chief complaint of gout and acute renal failure. He has been experiencing severe, tophaceous gout and was prescribed rheum rec steroids, but the dosage was switched to oral prednisone today. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received infusions and other medications in the ICU.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/84 mmHg to 125/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is 64.3 kg, and height is 65 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,165 mL and total output of 3,140 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,025 mL. The patient is not receiving respiratory support and has a SpO2 of 99%. Peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. Kidney function tests indicate elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values include low total carbon dioxide, normal glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of hypertension and chronic alcohol use, presenting with acute polyarticular arthritis, acute renal failure (ARF), metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, anemia, and leukocytosis. The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications.

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has been compromised, leading to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances. This can further exacerbate the patient's overall condition and may require dialysis or other forms of renal replacement therapy.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient is experiencing a metabolic acidosis, indicated by the presence of gap metabolic acidosis (uremia). This condition occurs when there is an accumulation of acids in the body due to impaired renal function. It can lead to various complications, including changes in mental status, cardiovascular instability, and muscle weakness.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient is also suffering from hyponatremia, which is characterized by low sodium levels in the blood. This electrolyte imbalance can affect nerve function and lead to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and muscle cramps.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be caused by several factors, including chronic alcohol use, gastrointestinal bleeding, or an underlying malignancy. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white"

   53M with acute polyarticular arthritis and acute renal failure
   acute polyarticular arthritis: although joint distribution is not
   classic, polys and needle shaped crystals and negative gram stain on
   microscopy of joint fluid is c/w gout. given ARF, would avoid NSAIDs
   and colchicine. pt does not complain of pain at this time and says he
   wants to avoid medications; will hold steroids for now per discussio
   with rheum, not necessary to treat unless in pain.
   -          Dose IV solumedrol today
   -          PO Prednisone tomorrow.
   leukemoid reaction: suspect stress response from several days of acute
   inflammatory illness. Other DDX iclude infection vs malignancy, however
   history no consistent with thiese.
   -Continue to trend
   - Concern for malignancy, check smear, Differential, C. Diff
   acute renal failure: BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1 and pt has not been taking
   adequate po x5 days, highly suggestive of prerenal azotemia. Cr down
   from 6.3 to 2.2  with 5L fluids, also consistent with prerenal
   azotemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with acute polyarticular arthritis and acute renal failure.
- The patient has gout, as confirmed by the presence of needle-shaped crystals in the joint fluid and negative gram stain.
- The patient is currently not in pain and has declined medication for gout, including steroids.
- The patient is experiencing a leukemoid reaction, which is a stress response to acute inflammation. Other possibilities include infection or malignancy.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by prerenal azotemia due to inadequate oral intake and a high BUN:Cr ratio.
- The patient's anemia is macrocytic, with a low hemoglobin concentration. There are no signs of active bleeding, but there is a concern for alcohol-related bone marrow suppression and iron deficiency. The patient will be transfused for a hemoglobin level below 21.
- The patient has hypertension, but antihypertensive medications will be held until the patient is fully volume resuscitated and stable.
- The patient has a multi-lumen line inserted on [**2141-5-27**] at 3:00 PM.
- Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.
- The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is unknown."

   acute polyarticular arthritis: although joint distribution is not
   classic, polys and needle shaped crystals and negative gram stain on
   microscopy of joint fluid is c/w gout. given ARF, would avoid NSAIDs
   and colchicine. pt does not complain of pain at this time and says he
   wants to avoid medications; will hold steroids for now per discussio
   with rheum, not necessary to treat unless in pain.
   -          Dose IV solumedrol today
   -          PO Prednisone tomorrow.
   leukemoid reaction: suspect stress response from several days of acute
   inflammatory illness. Other DDX iclude infection vs malignancy, however
   history no consistent with thiese.
   -Continue to trend
   - Concern for malignancy, check smear, Differential, C. Diff
   acute renal failure: BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1 and pt has not been taking
   adequate po x5 days, highly suggestive of prerenal azotemia. Cr down
   from 6.3 to 2.2  with 5L fluids, also consistent with prerenal
   azotemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with acute polyarticular arthritis and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/88 mmHg to 125/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and creatinine (Cr) levels. The WBC count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response. The Hct level is low, suggesting anemia. The Cr level has decreased from 6.3 to 2.2, indicating improvement in renal function.

The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with sodium (Na+) at 139 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 4.0 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 103 mEq/L, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 27.2%. The blood glucose level is normal at 101 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes gout, acute renal failure, and potential complications such as leukemoid reaction, acute renal failure, anemia, hypertension, and malignancy. The plan of care includes IV fluids, holding NSAIDs and colchicine due to acute renal failure, monitoring for signs of"
