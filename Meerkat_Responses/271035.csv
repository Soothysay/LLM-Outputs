   Ms. [**Known lastname 4135**] is a 47F with AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid
   antibody syndrome who presents with ~6 weeks of fatigue and dyspnea,
   now worse in the last 3-4 days, with productive cough.
   # Pneumonia: SIRS criteria of hypotension (note that outpt/ambulatory
   blood pressures have been 100-110s), T95.3 on arrival, RR 36; plus
   symptoms of resp infection and infiltrate on CXR.   Also began
   desatting on RA overnight and now is requiring 4 L NC.  ABG showed
   7.42/22/68 and her lactate was 1.1.
   - Continue to cover for CAP given infiltrate, productive cough with
   CTX/azithro as levo can interfere with AFB culture sensitivity
   - Given that pt is HIV +, with CD 189, other infections, such as TB,
   PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] fungus, are concerning. Will send induced sputums for PCP and
   AFB x3
   - Also check DFA to r/o flu
   # HIV: not on HAART [**2-7**] poor compliance. Has been taking atovaquone
   sporadically (reports taking for 2 of last 6 weeks);
   - Will restart atovaquone ppx.
   # antiphospholipid syndrome: Supratherapeutic INR at 14.3 this am.
   Received 5 mg IV K last night.  Hct stable this am.
   - Continue to follow INR and restart coumadin once back in the
   therapeutic range of [**2-8**].
   - Monitor for bleeding, if present would transfuse FFP.
   # cardiomyopathy: hold ACE-I, BB [**2-7**] to recent hypotension, infection.
   - Hold dig [**2-7**] ARF, dig level was 0.4, consider restarting once ARF
   resolves

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She presents with symptoms of pneumonia, fatigue, dyspnea, and a productive cough. The patient has been desatting on RA and is now requiring oxygen. She also had two episodes of diarrhea. Her vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 4 L NC. The patient is alert and appropriate neurologically. Physical examination reveals poor dentition, oral thrush, and coarse breath sounds scattered throughout the chest. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated potassium, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies show an infiltrate on the chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, and infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggest a respiratory infection, possibly pneumonia. The patient is already being treated with antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia.
2. Tuberculosis (TB): Given the patient's immunocompromised status due to AIDS, TB is a concern. Sputum samples have been sent for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) testing.
3. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): PCP is another opportunistic infection that can occur in individuals with HIV/AIDS. Ind"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She has been experiencing fatigue and dyspnea for approximately six weeks, which have worsened in the last three to four days. She presents with a productive cough, fever, and an infiltrate on chest X-ray. She is now requiring oxygen and has a decreased level of consciousness.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever, cough, and infiltrate on CXR, suggest a respiratory infection. Immediate coverage for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is necessary. Additionally, considering the patient's HIV status with a low CD4 count, other opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB), Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and fungal infections need to be ruled out. Sputum samples should be sent for PCP, acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and fungal cultures.

2. HIV: The patient is not currently on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) due to poor compliance. She has been sporadically taking atovaquone prophylaxis. HAART should be restarted, and efforts should be made to improve medication adherence.

3. Antiphospholipid syndrome: The patient's elevated INR indicates a supratherapeutic level. Coumadin therapy should be restarted once the INR returns to the therapeutic range of 2"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She presents with symptoms of pneumonia, including fatigue, dyspnea, and productive cough. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is receiving supplemental oxygen. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 mmHg to 128/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. Her other medical conditions include HIV/AIDS, for which she is not currently on HAART due to poor compliance, antiphospholipid syndrome, cardiomyopathy, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, and hypoxia, along with the presence of infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicate a diagnosis of pneumonia. The potential complications associated with pneumonia include sepsis, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. HIV/AIDS: The patient has a history of AIDS and is not currently on HAART therapy. Poor compliance with medication can lead to progression of HIV infection and opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB), Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and fungal infections.
3. Antiphospholipid Syndrome: This"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She presents with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and productive cough for approximately six weeks, which have worsened over the last three to four days.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 113/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her temperature is within the normal range at 37.1 degrees Celsius. The patient is on supplemental oxygen but does not require it currently.

The patient has a history of non-compliance with HAART therapy for HIV and sporadic use of atovaquone. She will be restarted on HAART therapy. Her INR is slightly below the therapeutic range, and she will start on heparin if the INR remains below 2. If the INR is between 2 and 8, she can continue with a lower dose of coumadin due to the concurrent use of antibiotics.

The patient also has cardiomyopathy and is currently on ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. These medications will be held due to hypotension and infection. Digoxin will be held as well, and its levels will be checked. If the patient's renal function improves, digoxin can be restarted.

The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU.
- The patient has a fever and increased oxygen requirement.
- The patient has a history of HIV and is not on HAART due to poor compliance.
- The patient is also diagnosed with acute renal failure, which is resolving with fluid resuscitation.
- The patient has a low EF (25-30%) indicating cardiomyopathy.
- The patient has oral thrush and increased bilateral lower lobe pneumonia with a right upper lobe patchy infiltrate on CXR.
- The patient's blood cultures, Legionella Ag, and influenza DFA are pending.
- The patient is on multiple medications including Coumadin, fluconazole, MVI, Colace, and others.
- The patient's vital signs are unstable with high heart rate, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe pneumonia: The patient's increased bilateral lower lobe pneumonia indicates a possible severe lung infection. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory distress and the presence of bilateral pneumonia increase the risk of developing ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's low EF and history of cardiomyopathy, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, which occurs"

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with a temperature of 39°C (102.2°F), heart rate of 149 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/16 mmHg to 132/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 47 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient has been febrile in the morning with increased oxygen requirements. The patient is on multiple medications including Coumadin (warfarin), MVI, and Colace. The patient has a history of HIV, acute renal failure, probable pneumonia, aplastic anemia, and cardiomyopathy. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are provided. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has an increased bilateral lower lobe pneumonia with a right upper lobe patchy infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's sputum, blood cultures, and influenza DFA are pending. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and the medical team is considering various treatment options.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing low oxygen saturation levels, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an increased bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, which can worsen if not treated promptly and effectively. This may lead to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 4135] is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She presented with approximately 6 weeks of fatigue and dyspnea, which have worsened over the last 3-4 days. She also has a productive cough. Upon arrival, her temperature was 95.3°F, heart rate was 36 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 36 breaths per minute. She required 4 liters of nasal cannula (NC) oxygen but is now saturating above 90% on room air, indicating improvement. She has infiltrates on the chest X-ray and meets the criteria for pneumonia. Sputum cultures are pending. 

The patient is HIV-positive with a CD4 count of 189, and other infections such as tuberculosis (TB), Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and fungal infections are concerning. She is not currently on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) due to poor compliance, although she sporadically takes atovaquone prophylaxis. 

She has a history of antiphospholipid syndrome, which is being managed with a supratherapeutic INR of 14.3 this morning. She received 5 mg IV potassium last night. Her hematocrit (Hct) is stable. 

The patient also has cardiomyopathy and requires"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a medical history of AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She presents with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and a productive cough for about six weeks, worsening over the last three to four days. On arrival, her temperature was 95.3°F, respiratory rate was 36 breaths per minute, and she required 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. An ABG showed a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 22, and PaO2 of 68. Her lactate level was 1.1 mmol/L. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, meeting the SIRS criteria due to hypotension (blood pressures in the 100-110s range), fever, respiratory infection symptoms, and a chest X-ray showing an infiltrate. She is being treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), while avoiding interference with AFB culture sensitivity. Other potential infections such as tuberculosis (TB), Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), and fungal infections are also being considered and tested for. 

The patient is HIV positive with a CD4 count of 189, and she is not currently on HAART due to poor compliance. Atovaquone prophylaxis will be restarted.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She presents with symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, and productive cough for about six weeks, which have worsened in the last three to four days.

The patient was initially diagnosed with pneumonia and met the criteria for sepsis-related illness (SIRS). She required supplemental oxygen and was placed on non-invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. However, her condition improved, and she is now able to saturate above 90% on room air.

The patient's medical history includes poor compliance with HAART therapy for HIV and sporadic use of atovaquone prophylaxis. She also has a history of cardiomyopathy, antiphospholipid syndrome, and renal failure.

Currently, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius (102.2 Fahrenheit), heart rate of 115 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/55 mmHg to 132/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is alert and oriented, but exhibits signs of increased work of breathing and uses accessory muscles.

Physical examination findings include poor dentition and oral thrush, tachycardia, no murmurs, 2+ peripheral edema, coarse breath sounds scattered"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She presents with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and productive cough for about 6 weeks. On admission, she was hypotensive, tachycardic, and had an increased respiratory rate. She also had an infiltrate on chest X-ray and required supplemental oxygen. The patient's condition has shown improvement with appropriate antibiotic therapy, and she is now saturating well on room air. 

Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which can cause a hypercoagulable state. She is currently on therapeutic INR but had a supratherapeutic INR this morning.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure, despite being on antihypertensive medications. This may be due to her underlying cardiomyopathy and infection.
3. Pneumonia: The patient initially met SIRS criteria for pneumonia, and her symptoms along with the presence of an infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest a respiratory infection. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but additional coverage for atypical pathogens and tuberculosis is being considered given her HIV-positive status.
4. HIV: The patient is not compliant with her HAART regimen and has only sporadically taken atovaquone prophylaxis"

1. Recurrent pneumonia: The patient's clinical response suggests a possible recurrence of pneumonia, which could lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's pre-renal acute renal failure is resolving with fluid resuscitation, but there is still a risk of further deterioration in kidney function.
3. HIV management: The patient's poor compliance with HAART"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient has a history of pneumonia, acute renal failure, HIV (not on HAART, poor compliance), aplastic anemia (supratherapeutic on coumadin), and cardiomyopathy (EF 25-30%). 

Upon admission, the patient was tachycardic and had crackles at the lung bases bilaterally. Vital signs included a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 103 bpm (Sinus Tachycardia), blood pressure ranging from 109/58 to 132/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Fluid balance showed a total input of 2,400 mL with 600 mL given intravenously, and a total output of 2,405 mL including 740 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output was 2,405 mL, and there was a negative fluid balance of 5 mL. 

Laboratory results indicated a white blood cell count of 9.9 g/dL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, platelet count of 140 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 22 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, glucose of 82 mg/dL, and sodium of 140 mEq/L. Other labs included elevated lactic acid levels, normal calcium and magnesium levels, and decreased total carbon dioxide level.

Microbiology tests were pending for AFB, urine culture, and stool culture. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's hypoxemic respiratory distress was resolved, likely due to pneumonia and fluid overload. The patient was given good clinical response and received management for pneumonia, including respiratory isolation for tuberculosis, DFA pending for influenza, and empirical coverage for community-acquired pneumonia.

The patient was also diagnosed with acute renal failure, which was pre-renal in nature and resolving with fluid resuscitation. The patient's HIV status was noted, with poor compliance to HAART therapy. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia and oral candidiasis was continued.

Additionally, the patient had aplastic anemia and was on supratherapeutic doses of coumadin. Anticoagulation was held, and the patient received vitamin K. The patient's cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25-30% was noted, and beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and digoxin were continued.

ICU care included nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status was full code, and the disposition was planned for transfer to the floor."
