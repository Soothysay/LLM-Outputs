","The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and pantoprazole. The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.6°F (Tmax: 38.7°C), and he is tachycardic with a heart rate of 105 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal limits at 148/55 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is set at 16 breaths per minute with spontaneous respiration of 1 breath per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 16 mL in the past 24 hours and an output of 52 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 36 mL. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14,400 cells/mm³, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 220-223 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count at 378,000/mm³. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.31 and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 158 mmHg.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He has been intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic shock and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and gout.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, including organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's sepsis and invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory impairment.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible acute renal failure, which may progress to AKI if not managed appropriately.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
5. Nosocomial Pneumonia (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia): The patient's prolonged intubation and invasive ventilation increase the risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient's critical"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He has been intubated for airway protection due to septic shock. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. ABGs are being titrated to optimize ventilation. There is a concern for ARDS due to the sepsis.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is trending upwards, indicating renal dysfunction. Low urine output is also present. Measures are in place to avoid nephrotoxins and adjust medication dosages accordingly.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, but it has been trending up. Monitoring of the hemoglobin levels will continue.

4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood sugar level is currently controlled, but the sliding scale will be decreased in aggression.

5. Gout: There are no acute issues related to gout, but pain control may be required when the patient is more alert.

6. Coronary artery disease with previous CABG, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia: Medications have been held due to septic shock, and the patient's vital signs will be monitored closely.

7. Access: The patient has a right internal jugular central venous line, peripheral intravenous line, and arterial line in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who now presents with acute cholecystitis and septic shock. He has been intubated for airway protection and is on invasive ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD s/p CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), diabetes mellitus (DM), and gout. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient being intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The physician has initiated a VAP bundle to prevent this complication.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Measures such as avoiding nephrotoxins and dose adjustment of medications according to renal function should be continued.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is low, indicating anemia. Monitoring and trend analysis of Hct levels should be done, along with appropriate blood product transfusion if necessary.

4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not currently indicated, the patient's history of diabetes mellitus puts him at risk for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis who now presents with acute cholecystitis and septic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy and was started on stress-dose steroids, but developed hyperkalemia following transfusion. The patient was placed on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes and a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with previous CABG, congestive heart failure, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gout, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's current condition is improving with decreasing lactate levels and reduced pressor requirement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to septic shock, which puts him at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Daily wake-up tests and VAP bundle should be implemented.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has hyperkalemia and acidosis with a rising creatinine level. CVVH has been initiated, but the patient's renal function should be closely monitored.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has had episodes of bradycardia with atrial pauses, indicating poor conduction. Pacer pads are in place, and dobutamine may increase demand.
4. Elevated Liver Enzymes: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis who was admitted to the ICU for acute cholecystitis and septic shock. He underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy but developed hyperkalemia following transfusion, for which he received calcium, insulin, and D50. He was started on stress-dose steroids. A central venous catheter, arterial line, and hemodialysis catheter were placed. The patient's condition has been complicated by refractory septic shock, acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis, bradycardia with atrial pauses, elevated liver enzymes, diabetes mellitus, gout, coronary artery disease with previous CABG, congestive heart failure, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refractory septic shock: The patient's septic shock has been resistant to treatment, indicating a potential life-threatening complication.
2. Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to elevated potassium levels and acidosis, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
3. Bradycardia with atrial pauses: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, with bradycardia and atrial pauses. This can lead to reduced cardiac output and potential cardiac arrest.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He presents with acute cholecystitis and septic shock, likely due to a biliary source. The patient's last admission culture only grew LACTOBACILLUS. He has a low white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and signs of respiratory distress. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is at risk for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's condition has been managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Zosyn and vancomycin. He is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy via continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Close monitoring and management of the patient's hemodynamics, respiratory status, renal function, and electrolyte balance are essential."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, which could lead to ongoing or recurrent infections. The presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs, chains, and clusters on the gram stain suggests a bacterial infection. Additionally, the patient is currently being treated with vancomycin (Vanc) and meropenem, which are antibiotics commonly used to treat severe infections.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is intubated due to septic shock and at risk for ARDS. Daily wake-up tests and VAP bundle implementation are recommended to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has poor conduction, recent myocardial infarction (MI), and persistent ST elevations with high troponin levels. This indicates potential cardiac complications, such as heart block or ongoing ischemia.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and low urine output, indicating possible acute renal failure. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) has been initiated to manage hyperkalemia and acidosis.

5. Elevated Liver Enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which could be due to hypoperfusion or ongoing liver injury from cholangitis. Monitoring for high calcium and low ionized calcium levels is recommended.

   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic
   shock.  CXR w/o acute process in ED. At risk for ARDS given sepsis. ET
   tube in position though 5 cm above carina.
   - titrate invasive ventilation by ABGs
   - daily wakeup
   - VAP bundle
   - daily CXR while intubated
   - sedation changed to versed/Fentanyl this AM due to discomfort on
   propofol

   # Bradycardia:  Poor conduction system [**1-27**] recent MI with
   mulitfasicular block.  Persistent ST elevations and high troponins.
   - pacer pads in place.  Would pace for complete heart block.
   - Dobutamine may increase demand
   .
   # Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis: Cr trending up to
   > 3 with low urine output.  Baseline appears to be low 2s.
   - on CVVH
   - follow renal recs
   - Appropriate dosing
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Ca Citrate dose lowered accordingly,  wastch for high Ca, low iCa
   .
   # DM: SSI was reduced.
   - start insulin drip in setting of rapidly changing endocrine state,
   steroids

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He now presents with acute cholecystitis and septic shock. The source of infection is likely cholecystitis, and the patient has a history of lactobacillus infection. His condition is improving with decreasing lactate and pressor requirement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refractory septic shock: The patient's septic shock is not responding to treatment, indicating a potential complication.
2. Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and low urine output, suggesting acute renal failure. Hyperkalemia and acidosis are also present, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia with a recent myocardial infarction (MI) and multifocal block. Persistent ST elevations and high troponin levels indicate ongoing cardiac issues.
4. Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Due to sepsis, the patient is at risk for developing ARDS. Intubation and invasive ventilation may be necessary.
5. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to hypoperfusion or other underlying liver pathology.
6. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's rapidly changing endocrine state and the presence of steroids may increase the"

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement now represents with acute cholecystitis and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Refractory septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.
   Previous admission grew LACTOBACILLUS. Urine negative. CXR
   unrevealing.  Worsened condition post drainage from blood seeding.
   Condition now improving, with decreasing lactate and pressor
   requirement. Bile cx grew Lactobacillus, other culture results pending.
   - Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].  Will discuss with ID regarding treatment of GPR,
   likely lactobacillus.
   - Will consider risk of clostridium perfringes, cover with Clindamycin
   800mg q8 until culture data confirmed.
   - follow cultures
   - Pressors off.
   - Fluids: at goal CVP 10-12, no more IVF indicated, appears euvolemic,
   will control w/ CVVH.
   - Last SVO2 is 50, will repeat SVO2 today.
   - Stress-dose steroids, has had 3 days, will d/c today.
   - arterial line in place, goal MAP > 65
   - appreciate surgery recs, will continue to follow after US today
   - monitor urine output closely-low this AM
   - repeat RUQ US today to assess fluid collection and f/u w/ surgery
   after exam.
   .
   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic
   shock.  CXR w/o acute process in ED. At risk for ARDS given sepsis, but
   no sig changes on CXR and clear lung exam today. ET tube in position
   though 5 cm above carina.
   - titrate invasive ventilation by ABGs
   - daily wakeup
   - VAP bundle
   - daily CXR while intubated
   - sedation changed to versed/Fentanyl this AM due to discomfort on
   propofol
   - changed to PSV on rounds, with improved respiration timing, will
   leave on PSV for now.
   - will come down on sedation and head towards extubation as soon as
   possible.
   .
   # Bradycardia:  Poor conduction system [**1-27**] recent MI with
   mulitfasicular block.  Persistent ST elevations and high troponins.
   - pacer pads in place.  Would pace for complete heart block.
   - no current bradycardia.
   .
   # Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis: Cr trending up to
   > 3 with low urine output.  Baseline appears to be low 2s.
   - on CVVH, Cr normalizing, but difficult to assess while on CVVH,
   likely has significant renal disease.
   - follow renal recs
   - Appropriate dosing
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Ca Citrate dose lowered accordingly,  wastch for high Ca, low iCa
   - Follow LFTs, check amylase and lipase,

","The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who now presents with acute cholecystitis and septic shock. The patient had a previous admission where Lactobacillus was grown in the urine, and the current bile culture also shows growth of Lactobacillus. Other culture results are pending. The patient's condition is improving, with decreasing lactate and pressor requirement.

The patient has been treated with vancomycin, clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem. The plan is to continue vancomycin and discuss the treatment of GPR (likely lactobacillus) with the ID team. Clostridium perfringens coverage will be provided with clindamycin until culture data confirms. The patient's fluids will be controlled with CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). 

The patient's respiratory status is being managed with intubation for airway protection due to septic shock. The patient's arterial line is in place, and the goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is >65. The patient will undergo a repeat RUQ (right upper quadrant) ultrasound today to assess fluid collection and follow up with surgery after the exam.

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement now represents with acute cholecystitis and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Refractory septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.
   Cultures showing lactobacillus, consistent with previous episode of
   Lactobacillus sepsis.  Worsened condition post drainage from blood
   seeding.  Condition now improving, with decreasing lactate and pressor
   requirement.  Persistent undrained collection on ultrasound.
   - Inadequate source control.  Will discuss with surgery and IR.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   need CT for further evaluation.  Is not likely to me more stable for
   surgery at a later date.  Would consider esmolol peri-op if going for
   CCY.  Repositioning of drain by IR may allow for better drainage.
   - Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - follow cultures
   - Pressors off.
   - Fluids: at goal CVP 10-12, no more IVF indicated, appears euvolemic,
   will control w/ CVVH.
   - Goal SVO2 >70
   - Off steroids
   - arterial line in place, may need changing, goal MAP > 65
   - monitor urine output closely-low this AM
   - repeat RUQ US today to assess fluid collection and f/u w/ surgery
   after exam.
   .
   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic
   shock.  CXR w/o acute process in ED. At risk for ARDS given sepsis, but
   no sig changes on CXR and clear lung exam today. ET tube in position
   though 5 cm above carina.
   - titrate invasive ventilation by ABGs
   - daily wakeup
   - VAP bundle
   - daily CXR while intubated
   - sedation changed to versed/Fentanyl this AM due to discomfort on
   propofol
   - decreasing pressure support requirements
   - will come down on sedation and head towards extubation as soon as
   possible.
   - LENIs to r/o DVT
   .
   # Poor mental status:  Likely toxic-metabolic with persistent effect of
   sedation in setting of liver and renal dysfunction.  Hypoxic brain
   injury is also possible, given recent refractory shock
   - off sedation, continue to monitor
   - will do head CT if going for CT of other areas
   .
   # Bradycardia:  Poor conduction system [**1-27**] recent MI with
   mulitfasicular block.  Persistent ST elevations and high troponins.
   - pacer pads in place.  Would pace for complete heart block.
   - stable currently.
   .
   # Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis: Cr trending up to
   > 3 with low urine output.  Baseline appears to be low 2s.
   - on CVVH, Cr normalizing, but difficult to assess while on CVVH,
   likely has significant renal disease.
   - follow renal recs
   - Appropriate dosing
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Ca Citrate dose lowered accordingly,  watch for high Ca, low iCa.
   Both low currently
   - Follow LFTs, check amylase and lipase,

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who was admitted for acute cholecystitis and septic shock. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease with previous CABG, congestive heart failure, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes mellitus, and gout. The patient's current condition is improving, with decreasing lactate levels and pressor requirement, but he still has persistent undrained collection in the gallbladder fossa. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he remains at risk for complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and nosocomial pneumonia (VAP). The patient's mental status is poor due to toxic-metabolic effects, sedation, liver and renal dysfunction, and possible hypoxic brain injury. The patient also has bradycardia with a persistent ST elevation and high troponin levels indicating ongoing myocardial ischemia. He has acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, and hyperglycemia. The patient's medications include multiple antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and other supportive therapies. The patient's family has been informed about the current condition and code status. The patient is expected to continue in"

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement now represents with acute cholecystitis and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Refractory septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.
   Cultures showing lactobacillus, consistent with previous episode of
   Lactobacillus sepsis.  Worsened condition post drainage from blood
   seeding.  Condition now improving, with decreasing lactate and pressor
   requirement.  Persistent undrained collection on ultrasound.
   - Inadequate source control.  Will discuss with surgery and IR.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   need CT for further evaluation.  Is not likely to me more stable for
   surgery at a later date.  Would consider esmolol peri-op if going for
   CCY.  Repositioning of drain by IR may allow for better drainage.
   - Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - follow cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis who presents with acute cholecystitis and septic shock. The patient's condition has improved with decreasing lactate levels and pressor requirements, but there is still an undrained collection on ultrasound. The patient's current plan includes continuing vancomycin, following cultures, removing the arterial line, controlling fluids with CVVH, maintaining a goal SVO2 >70, and monitoring urine output closely. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and there are no significant changes on the chest X-ray. The patient's mental status is likely toxic-metabolic with possible hypoxic brain injury. The patient has bradycardia due to poor conduction, likely related to a recent myocardial infarction. The patient also has acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, diabetes, gout, coronary artery disease with previous CABG, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient has various access lines and is on multiple medications."

   drainage improved thismorning after RUQ US.
   - Source control. Drainage tube repositioned during ABD CT yesterday
   with 20cc of drainage. Further drainage this AM after US. Will monitor
   drainage as improves clinically, will re-image w/ ultrasound if
   worsens.
   - Per ID recs and cx data, will d/c IV Vanc and Clinda, and continue
   [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis sepis/cholecystitis.
   - follow cultures
   - Pressors off, steroids off.
   - arterial line in place, may need changing, goal MAP > 65
   - monitor urine output closely, increased over night wi/ additional

   completed.
   .
   # Poor mental status:  Likely toxic-metabolic with persistent effect of
   sedation in setting of liver and renal dysfunction.  Hypoxic brain
   injury is also possible, given recent refractory shock. PT now off
   sedation, but continues to have poor MS.
   - monitor, frequent neuron checks
   - Head CT showed multiple hypodensities in cerebellum, unclear
   chronicity or etiology
   - Will likely do MRI while still intubated. Renal aware, will need to
   do HD x 3 days following MRI contrast, will discuss with radiology
   necessity of contrast.
   - Neurology consult after MRI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He has a history of recent myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease (CAD) with CABG, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), diabetes mellitus (DM), and gout. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to septic shock, which was caused by cholecystitis. He is also sedated and has a poor mental status, likely due to toxic-metabolic effects or hypoxic brain injury.

The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on several medications including aspirin, statin, ACE inhibitor, amlodipine, lasix, prazosin, esmolol, and metoprolol. He has a history of gout but no acute issues at present. His family history is significant for coronary artery disease.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/47 to 102/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His physical examination reveals clear lungs, distended but soft abdomen, and warmer extremities. He has small but reactive pupils, dry tongue, and midline"

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement now represents with acute cholecystitis and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Refractory septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.
   Cultures showing lactobacillus, consistent with previous episode of
   Lactobacillus sepsis.  Worsened condition post drainage from blood
   seeding.  Condition now improving, with decreasing lactate and pressor
   requirement.  Persistent undrained collection on ultrasound, but
   drainage improved thismorning after RUQ US.
   - Source control. Drainage tube repositioned during ABD CT yesterday
   with 20cc of drainage. Further drainage this AM after US. Will monitor
   drainage as improves clinically, will re-image w/ ultrasound if
   worsens.
   - Per ID recs and cx data, will d/c IV Vanc and Clinda, and continue
   [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis sepis/cholecystitis.
   - follow cultures
   - Pressors off, steroids off.
   - arterial line in place, may need changing, goal MAP > 65
   - monitor urine output closely, increased over night wi/ additional
   fluid, but decreasing again this AM
   - Fluids: at goal CVP 10-12, followed by renal, suggest no more fluid
   at this time, and no need for immediate HD.
   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic
   shock.  CXR w/o acute process in ED. At risk for ARDS given sepsis, but
   no sig changes on CXR and clear lung exam today. ET tube in position
   though 5 cm above carina.
   - titrate invasive ventilation by ABGs
   - daily wakeup
   - VAP bundle
   - daily CXR while intubated
   - sedation no off
   - continue to wean vent settings, but will not plan to extubate until
   clinical picture improves and necessary imaging and procedures are
   completed.
   .
   # Poor mental status:  Likely toxic-metabolic with persistent effect of
   sedation in setting of liver and renal dysfunction.  Hypoxic brain
   injury is also possible, given recent refractory shock. PT now off
   sedation, but continues to have poor MS.
   - monitor, frequent neuron checks
   - Head CT showed multiple hypodensities in cerebellum, unclear
   chronicity or etiology
   - Will likely do MRI while still intubated. Renal aware, will need to
   do HD x 3 days following MRI contrast, will discuss with radiology
   necessity of contrast.
   - Neurology consult after MRI
   .
   # Bradycardia:  Poor conduction system [**1-27**] recent MI with
   mulitfasicular block.  Persistent ST elevations and high troponins.
   - pacer pads in place.  Would pace for complete heart block.
   - stable currently.
   .
   # Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis.  Baseline appears
   to be low 2s.  Cr improved overnight to 1.6, but rising again to 1.9
   this am. Prognosis for renal function unclear at this time.
   -Renal following closely, appreciate recs: minimal IVF and no need for
   HD at this time
   -Electrolytes normalizing, academia resolving. Will check another ABG.
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Ca Citrate dose lowered accordingly,  watch for high Ca, low iCa.
   Both low currently
   - Follow LFTs, check amylase and lipase,
   .
   # DM: SSI
   .
   # Gout: no acute issues, complaining of foot pain prior to admission,
   pain control prn when more alert
   .
   #CAD s/p CABG; CHF, HTN, BPH:
   -holding asa, statin, ace-i, amlodipine, lasix, prazosin in setting of
   septic shock
   -started on Esmolol drip yesterday for post MI cardiprotection
   -switch to PO metroprolol 12.5 TID today.
   .
   #Access: R IJ CVL placed in ED, PIV, arterial line (not working, will
   resite), HD cath in R groin
   .
   # FEn: OG tube, replete lytes prn
   - Discussed w/ surgery, given improving sepsis and presence of BS this
   am, will restart TF per nutrition recs
   - Nutrition consult
   .
   #PPx: sc heparin, ISS, bowel regimen
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who is now presenting with acute cholecystitis and septic shock. The patient's condition has improved since the drainage of an undrained collection via RUQ US, but he still has persistent undrained collection on ultrasound. Cultures have shown lactobacillus, consistent with a previous episode of lactobacillus sepsis. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and he is intubated for airway protection. His mental status is poor, likely due to toxic-metabolic effects of sedation in the setting of liver and renal dysfunction. The patient also has bradycardia, likely due to poor conduction system secondary to recent myocardial infarction with multifocal block. He has acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, and diabetes mellitus. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG, congestive heart failure, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gout, and chronic atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Refractory septic shock: The patient's septic shock has been refractory, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis, which requires close monitoring and management.

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement now represents with acute cholecystitis and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Refractory septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.
   Cultures showing lactobacillus, consistent with previous episode of
   Lactobacillus [**Telephone/Fax (3) **].  Worsened condition post drainage from blood
   seeding.  Condition now improving, with decreasing lactate and pressor
   requirement.  Persistent undrained collection on ultrasound, but
   drainage improved after RUQ US yesterday.
   - Source control. Drainage tube repositioned during ABD CT yesterday
   with 20cc of drainage. Further drainage yesterday after US. Will
   monitor drainage as improves clinically, will re-image w/ ultrasound if
   worsens.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis sepis/cholecystitis and new cx data
   of Citrobacter Freundii from bile
   - Pressors off, steroids off.
   - arterial line in place, may need changing, goal MAP > 65
   - urine output has been > 60cc/ht for last 6 hours
   - Fluids: at goal CVP 10-12, followed by renal, suggest no more fluid
   at this time, and no need for immediate HD.
   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic
   shock.  Partially extubated himself last night, and was reintubated by
   anesthesia without complication. Currently doing well, with good sats
   on PS 5 and PEEP of 5 fiO2 50%.
   - titrate invasive ventilation by ABGs
   - daily wakeup
   - VAP bundle
   - daily CXR while intubated
   - sedation off and mental status improving.
   - will change OG to NG today
   - Given extubation event, possibility of aspiration, will have low
   threshold for starting broad Abx if fever/cough/WBC develop.
   - continue to wean vent settings, will consider extubation this
   afternoon or tomorrow if continues to improve clinically and mental
   status improves. Would like to remove femoral HD line before extubation
   to allow him to sit up more. Will discuss with renal.
   .
   # Poor mental status:  Likely toxic-metabolic with persistent effect of
   sedation in setting of liver and renal dysfunction.  Hypoxic brain
   injury is also possible, given recent refractory shock, and embolic
   stroke old vs. new also possible given MRI read. Mental status
   significantly improved today. Pt awake but somnolent, able to respond
   to questions, able to follow commands.
   - monitor, frequent neuro checks,
   - Continue to watch MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] improves.
   - Consider neurology consult if does not continue to improve.
   .
   # Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis.  Baseline appears
   to be low 2s.  Cr was 1.5 following dialysis, but rising again to 1.9
   yesterday, 2.0 this am. Cr plateauing 48 hours after HD suggests
   recovering renal function. Urine output has been good  averaging
   >60cc/hr over last 12 hours.
   -Renal following closely, appreciate recs: cautiously optimistic about
   returning renal function, continue minimal IVF and if Cr continues to
   stay low tomorrow, will pull the R fem HD catheter.
   -Electrolytes normalizing, academia resolving.
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Ca Citrate dose lowered accordingly,  watch for high Ca, low iCa.
   Both low currently
   - Follow LFTs, check amylase and lipase,

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who now presents with acute cholecystitis and septic shock. He has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease post CABG, congestive heart failure, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes mellitus, and gout. The patient's condition has improved with appropriate source control and antibiotic therapy, but he still requires ongoing supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged intubation. Daily wake-up tests and frequent chest X-rays will be performed to monitor for this complication.

2. Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary. The patient may require further dialysis if his renal function does not improve.

3. Neurological: The patient has a poor mental status, likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, hypoxic brain injury, or embolic stroke. Frequent neurologic checks and consideration of a neurology consult are advised if there is no improvement in mental status.

4. Liver: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely secondary to hypoperfusion. Monitoring of liver function tests and adjustment of medications such as calcium citrate will be necessary"

The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to [reason for admission]. 

24-hour events include:
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the head, which showed subacute infarcts in both cerebral hemispheres, left thalami, and punctate foci in anterior and posterior distributions.
- Placement of a PICC line.
- Removal of a right internal jugular (RIJ) catheter.
- Cultures grew Citrobacter, which is well covered by meropenem.
- Titration of metoprolol to 37.5mg TID while titrating down esmolol.
- Requirement of fentanyl for agitation. Addition of haldol for episodes of agitation.
- Called regarding likely displacement of endotracheal tube (ETT) - oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%, no distress, audible breathing, chest X-ray difficult to see ETT.
- Called anesthesia to adjust tube or reintubate as the patient is unlikely to tolerate extubation challenge due to poor mental status.

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement now represents with acute cholecystitis and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Refractory septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.  Blood
   cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii. Recovering
   well. Last lactate 1.0.
   - Source control percutaneous cholecystostomy tube continuing to drain
   will stay in place for near future.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii.
   - Pressors off, steroids off. Hemodynamics stable
   - urine output has been good, 30-60 cc/hr on average
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance approx even as making good urine, and
   has good hemodynamics.
   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic
   shock.  Currently doing well, with good sats on PS 5 and PEEP of 5 fiO2
   50%. Last RSBI 75. Pt able to tolerate PEEP of 0 during rounds with
   good lung volumes.
   - daily CXR while intubated
   - mental status improving, pt awake, alert.
   - OG tube replaced by NG tube, and TFs were started, then held for
   residuals and for extubation
   - Given extubation event, possibility of aspiration, will have low
   threshold for starting broad Abx if fever/cough/WBC develop.
   - Renal recs: can remove R fem HD line, keep fluids even.
   .
   # Poor mental status:  Likely toxic-metabolic with persistent effect of
   sedation in setting of liver and renal dysfunction.  Hypoxic brain
   injury is also possible, given recent refractory shock, and embolic
   stroke old vs. new also possible given MRI read. Mental status
   significantly improved today. Pt awake but somnolent, able to respond
   to questions, able to follow commands.
   - Continue to watch MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] improves.
   - Consider neurology consult if does not continue to improve.
   .
   # Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis.  Baseline appears
   to be low 2s.  Cr was 1.5 following dialysis, but rising again to 1.9
   yesterday, 2.0 this am. Cr plateauing 72 hours after HD suggests
   recovering renal function. Urine output has been good  averaging
   >60cc/hr over last 12 hours.
   -Renal following closely, appreciate recs: cautiously optimistic about
   returning renal function. Given stable Cr today, will remove R fem HD
   line.
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Resolving, follow LFTs, check amylase and lipase,
   .
   # DM: SSI
   .
   # Gout: no acute issues, complaining of foot pain prior to admission,
   pain control prn when more alert
   .
   #CAD s/p CABG; CHF, HTN, BPH:
   -holding asa, statin, ace-i, amlodipine, lasix, prazosin in setting of
   septic shock
   -Esmolol drip restarted for hypertension and to prepare for extubation
   -Metroprolol increased to 75 TID today.
   .
   #Access: PICC line. PIV x2, HD cath in R groin. 1 PIV to be removed
   today for dates, and the HD to be removed as well.
   .
   # FEn: TF restarted. Held this am for possibility of extubation. Will
   restart tube feeds after extubation.
   .
   #PPx: sc heparin, ISS, bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He has been diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, septic shock, refractory septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube in place, which will remain for the near future. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for lactobacillus and citrobacter freundii. Pressors have been stopped, and steroids have been discontinued. The patient's urine output has been good, averaging 30-60 cc/hr. His mental status has improved significantly, and he is now awake, alert, and responsive to commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient is at risk of aspiration due to being intubated and having a poor mental status. This risk increases during the event of extubation.
2. Infection: The patient is already septic and on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a potential for further infections, especially if the patient develops fever, cough, or an elevated white blood cell count.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis. Close monitoring of renal function is required, and further renal interventions may be necessary.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of allergies to Pneumovax 23, Allopurinol, and Hydralazine. The patient received antibiotics including Vancomycin, Metronidazole, and Meropenem. The patient is currently on various infusions such as Fentanyl and has been prescribed Pantoprazole, Heparin Sodium, and other medications. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/51 to 178/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 90.2 kg at admission to 99.9 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 839 mL (308 mL PO, 567 mL IVF) and output of 1,623 mL (360 mL urine, 75 mL NG, 90 mL drains). 

The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 428 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 75. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 324, and ventilation rate (Ve) of 9.7 L/min. 

Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic response, movement, tone, and other systems. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 232 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 9.1 g/dL, blood glucose at 144 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.9 mg/dL, total bilirubin (TBili) at 2.0 mg/dL, and other abnormalities. The patient has been monitored with various lines, catheters, and arterial and central venous pressures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT formation.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay, use of corticosteroids, and mechanical ventilation can predispose the patient to stress ulcers.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload.
5. Infection: Elevated WBC count and abnormal blood cultures suggest the possibility of an infection.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement now represents with acute cholecystitis and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Refractory septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.
   Cultures showing lactobacillus, consistent with previous episode of
   Lactobacillus [**Telephone/Fax (3) **].  Worsened condition post drainage from blood
   seeding.  Condition now improving, with decreasing lactate and pressor
   requirement.  Persistent undrained collection on ultrasound, but
   drainage improved after RUQ US yesterday.
   - Source control. Drainage tube repositioned during ABD CT yesterday
   with 20cc of drainage. Further drainage yesterday after US. Will
   monitor drainage as improves clinically, will re-image w/ ultrasound if
   worsens.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis sepis/cholecystitis and new cx data
   of Citrobacter Freundii from bile
   - Pressors off, steroids off.
   - arterial line in place, may need changing, goal MAP > 65
   - urine output has been > 60cc/ht for last 6 hours
   - Fluids: at goal CVP 10-12, followed by renal, suggest no more fluid
   at this time, and no need for immediate HD.
   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic
   shock.  Partially extubated himself last night, and was reintubated by
   anesthesia without complication. Currently doing well, with good sats
   on PS 5 and PEEP of 5 fiO2 50%.
   - titrate invasive ventilation by ABGs
   - daily wakeup
   - VAP bundle
   - daily CXR while intubated
   - sedation off and mental status improving.
   - will change OG to NG today
   - Given extubation event, possibility of aspiration, will have low
   threshold for starting broad Abx if fever/cough/WBC develop.
   - continue to wean vent settings, will consider extubation this
   afternoon or tomorrow if continues to improve clinically and mental
   status improves. Would like to remove femoral HD line before extubation
   to allow him to sit up more. Will discuss with renal.
   .
   # Poor mental status:  Likely toxic-metabolic with persistent effect of
   sedation in setting of liver and renal dysfunction.  Hypoxic brain
   injury is also possible, given recent refractory shock, and embolic
   stroke old vs. new also possible given MRI read. Mental status
   significantly improved today. Pt awake but somnolent, able to respond
   to questions, able to follow commands.
   - monitor, frequent neuro checks,
   - Continue to watch MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] improves.
   - Consider neurology consult if does not continue to improve.
   .
   # Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis.  Baseline appears
   to be low 2s.  Cr was 1.5 following dialysis, but rising again to 1.9
   yesterday, 2.0 this am. Cr plateauing 48 hours after HD suggests
   recovering renal function. Urine output has been good  averaging
   >60cc/hr over last 12 hours.
   -Renal following closely, appreciate recs: cautiously optimistic about
   returning renal function, continue minimal IVF and if Cr continues to
   stay low tomorrow, will pull the R fem HD catheter.
   -Electrolytes normalizing, academia resolving.
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Ca Citrate dose lowered accordingly,  watch for high Ca, low iCa.
   Both low currently
   - Follow LFTs, check amylase and lipase,
   .
   # DM: SSI
   .
   # Gout: no acute issues, complaining of foot pain prior to admission,
   pain control prn when more alert
   .
   #CAD s/p CABG; CHF, HTN, BPH:
   -holding asa, statin, ace-i, amlodipine, lasix, prazosin in setting of
   septic shock
   -D/c
d esmolol drip,
   -Increased  metroprolol to 50 TID today.
   .
   #Access: PICC line placed. R IJ CVL removed.  PIV x2, HD cath in R
   groin
   .
   # FEn: OG tube will be changed to NG tube, replete lytes prn
   - TF restarted last night, was held overnight for high residuals, will
   start again this PM after NG tube placed and verified.
   - Nutrition consult
   .
   #PPx: sc heparin, ISS, bowel regimen

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with refractory septic shock, likely due to cholecystitis, and is showing signs of improvement. He has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, diabetes mellitus, gout, and coronary artery disease with a history of CABG.

The patient's mental status has improved but is still somnolent and not at baseline. He is awake and alert, able to engage in conversation and follow commands. Neurological examination reveals decreased strength and use of the left upper extremity, along with poor lower extremity discriminatory function and decreased sensation below the knees. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/38 to 169/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1546 mL, including 80 mL orally and 1111 mL intravenously, with an output of 1337 mL, including 1307 mL of urine.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 9.1 g/d"

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement now represents with acute cholecystitis and
   septic shock.
   .
   # Refractory septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.  Blood
   cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii. Recovering
   well. Last lactate 1.0.
   - Source control percutaneous cholecystostomy tube continuing to drain
   will stay in place for near future.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii.
   - Pressors off, steroids off. Hemodynamics stable
   - urine output has been good, 30-60 cc/hr on average
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance approx even as making good urine, and
   has good hemodynamics.
   # Respiratory: intubated for airway protection in the setting of septic
   shock.  Currently doing well, with good sats on PS 5 and PEEP of 5 fiO2
   50%. Last RSBI 75. Pt able to tolerate PEEP of 0 during rounds with
   good lung volumes.
   - daily CXR while intubated
   - mental status improving, pt awake, alert.
   - OG tube replaced by NG tube, and TFs were started, then held for
   residuals and for extubation
   - Given extubation event, possibility of aspiration, will have low
   threshold for starting broad Abx if fever/cough/WBC develop.
   - Renal recs: can remove R fem HD line, keep fluids even.
   .
   # Poor mental status:  Likely toxic-metabolic with persistent effect of
   sedation in setting of liver and renal dysfunction.  Hypoxic brain
   injury is also possible, given recent refractory shock, and embolic
   stroke old vs. new also possible given MRI read. Mental status
   significantly improved today. Pt awake but somnolent, able to respond
   to questions, able to follow commands.
   - Continue to watch MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] improves.
   - Consider neurology consult if does not continue to improve.
   .
   # Acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis.  Baseline appears
   to be low 2s.  Cr was 1.5 following dialysis, but rising again to 1.9
   yesterday, 2.0 this am. Cr plateauing 72 hours after HD suggests
   recovering renal function. Urine output has been good  averaging
   >60cc/hr over last 12 hours.
   -Renal following closely, appreciate recs: cautiously optimistic about
   returning renal function. Given stable Cr today, will remove R fem HD
   line.
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Resolving, follow LFTs, check amylase and lipase,
   .
   # DM: SSI
   .
   # Gout: no acute issues, complaining of foot pain prior to admission,
   pain control prn when more alert
   .
   #CAD s/p CABG; CHF, HTN, BPH:
   -holding asa, statin, ace-i, amlodipine, lasix, prazosin in setting of
   septic shock
   -Esmolol drip restarted for hypertension and to prepare for extubation
   -Metroprolol increased to 75 TID today.
   .
   #Access: PICC line. PIV x2, HD cath in R groin. 1 PIV to be removed
   today for dates, and the HD to be removed as well.
   .
   # FEn: TF restarted. Held this am for possibility of extubation. Will
   restart tube feeds after extubation.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis who was admitted for those conditions. He subsequently developed acute cholecystitis and septic shock. The blood cultures showed lactobacillus and Citrobacter freundii. The patient is currently recovering well, with a last lactate level of 1.0. A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed and will remain in place for the near future. Antibiotics are being continued for lactobacillus and Citrobacter freundii.

The patient is intubated for airway protection due to septic shock. His respiratory status is stable, with good oxygen saturation on PS 5 and PEEP of 5, FiO2 50%. The patient is awake and alert, with an improving mental status.

The patient has acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and acidosis. His creatinine levels have plateaued after hemodialysis, indicating recovering renal function. The urine output has been good, averaging >60cc/hr over the last 12 hours.

There are elevated liver enzymes, likely due to hypoperfusion. These are resolving, and liver function tests will be monitored.

The patient has diabetes mellitus, gout, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CAD s/p CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who has now developed refractory septic shock with a source likely being cholecystitis. He also has new abnormalities on neuro exam and an MRI showing infarcts. The patient's mental status has improved significantly, but he remains somnolent and able to respond to questions and follow commands. He is still experiencing acute renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, diabetes mellitus, gout, and coronary artery disease with a history of CABG. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has refractory septic shock, indicating a severe infection. There is a risk of further infections due to his compromised immune system.
2. Neurological issues: The patient has new abnormalities on neuro exam and MRI infarcts, which could indicate potential neurological complications such as hypoxic brain injury or embolic stroke.
3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may progress if not properly managed.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating liver dysfunction. This may lead to further complications related to liver function.
5. Cardiovascular problems: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and CABG. There is a risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which increases the risk of diabetic complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement and showed improvement. However, he now presents with new neurological abnormalities on examination and MRI findings. The patient's mental status has significantly improved, but he remains somnolent. He is able to respond to questions and follow commands. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's recent infection and neurological findings raise concern for possible endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves.
2. Spinal cord lesions/infarct/epidural abscess: The patient's neurologic symptoms and MRI findings suggest the possibility of spinal cord involvement, such as lesions, infarction, or an epidural abscess.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 2.0, indicating impaired kidney function. It is important to monitor and manage his renal function closely.
4. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to hypoperfusion. Monitoring and follow-up are necessary to determine the cause and extent of liver dysfunction.
5. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient has a history of DM, and his glycemic control should be monitored.
6. Gout: The patient complains of foot pain, and pain control should be managed when he is more alert.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize / add
   the following points: 74M cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis c/b
   septic shock. Blood and biliary cultures are positive for GPC, GPR /
   lactobacillus. Extubated successfully 26th. Off dialysis.  Profound b/l
   LE and RUE weakness since extubation. Better LE exam today than
   yesterday. Family visiting when rounded on pt, felt speach more garbled
   though seems somewhat improved to me vs. when we rounded yesterday
   (family not present then).  Less drainage from choley tube, low grade
   temp.

   (improved vs. yesterday).

   Agree with plan to continue meropenem for lactobacillus / citrobacter
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] / cholangitis. Biliary drainage much slower today and developing
   low grade temp.  If persists, need to establish adequate location of
   drain in GB. Continue to follow serial labs, blood cultures, and exam.
   Doing well from resp standpoint s/p extubation.  Renal function
 creat
   still elevated but making urine and no longer requiring dialysis. .
   Major activity last 24hrs surrounding b/l LE weakness, RUE weakness.
   Also mult lesions noted brain c/w embolic phenomenon.  Org from blood
   not classic for causing endocarditis and no h/o valve damage that would
   predispose pt to seeding.  No new murmur.  Given brain lesions with
   more embolic than watershed distribution, need to assess for source.
   Start w/ TTE w/ bubble study to grossly look at valves and assess for
   PFO.  Doubt would tolerate TEE at present so reasonable first step.
   Team discussing spine MRI results with neuro and neuroradiology
   etiology not clear but apparently could be related to embolic or
   hypoperfusion.  Given [**Telephone/Fax (1) **], hypotension latter certainly possible.
   Given head lesions, potential for embolic troubling.  No intervention
   at present.  Repeat MRI but given recent contrast load, will not repeat
   immediately.  Family is aware of findings and thoughts.  Neuro and
   neurorad involved as is ID for potential infectious etiology.  Serial
   neuro exams including sensorymotor and mental status.
   Pt remains critically ill.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, with recent infarcts on MRI in the setting of new neurologic exam abnormalities. The patient has improved mental status and is awake but somnolent, able to respond to questions and follow commands. He has acute renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, diabetes mellitus, gout, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and is currently on multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's history of cholangitis and positive blood cultures for lactobacillus and citrobacter freundii raise concerns for endocarditis. Further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with bubble study is recommended to assess for vegetations on heart valves and assess for patent foramen ovale (PFO).
2. Embolic Phenomenon: Brain lesions with more embolic than watershed distribution suggest a potential source of emboli. The source needs to be assessed, and appropriate intervention should be considered.
3. Spinal Cord Lesions: The patient has neurologic exam abnormalities and MRI findings suggestive of spinal cord lesions. Further evaluation with repeat MRI is needed to determine the etiology of these lesions.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has a baseline creatinine of"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement and showed improvement. However, he now presents with new infarcts on MRI, new abnormalities on neuro exam, and refractory septic shock. Blood cultures showed lactobacillus and Citrobacter freundii. The patient is currently recovering well, with a last lactate level of 1.0. The percutaneous cholecystostomy tube will remain in place for the near future.

The patient's mental status has significantly improved today, as he is awake but somnolent, able to respond to questions, and follow commands. It is likely that his poor mental status is due to toxic-metabolic effects, persistent sedation in the setting of liver and renal dysfunction, hypoxic brain injury, or embolic stroke (old vs. new).

The patient's other medical conditions include acute renal failure post CVVH for hyperkalemia, with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 and today's level of 1.7. He also has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to hypoperfusion, which are resolving. He has diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control, gout, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement. He has resolved lactobacillus/citrobacter infection and is recovering well. However, he now presents with new infarcts on MRI and abnormalities on neuro exam. His mental status has improved significantly today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Poor mental status in setting of abnormal neurological exam and new MRI abnormalities: This could be due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy with persistent effect of sedation in setting of liver and renal dysfunction. Hypoxic brain injury is also possible, given recent refractory shock, and embolic stroke old vs. new also possible given MRI read.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient had CVVH for hyperkalemia, and his baseline creatinine was 2.0, which has improved to 1.8 today. Monitoring is advised.
3. Elevated liver enzymes: This may be due to hypoperfusion and is resolving. Follow-up is recommended.
4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has SSI.
5. Gout: The patient complains of foot pain prior to admission, and pain control is given when more alert.
6. Coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): The patient is on multiple medications including ASA, statin, ACE-I, lasix, and prazosin. Esmolol drip has been discontinued, metoprolol increased to 100 TID today, and amlodipine restarted on 9/20.
7. Feeding: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) via NG.
8. Glycemic control: Good control is currently maintained.
9. Access: PICC line is in place.
10. Pre-procedure: The patient received sc heparin, intravenous immunoglobulin (ISS), and bowel regimen including Miralax.
11. Communication: The patient's wife, [Name (NI) 246], has been informed and is the healthcare power of attorney. Son [Name (NI)] can be contacted at [Telephone/Fax (1) 1881].
12. Code status: The patient has confirmed full code status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He has had a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placed, which is currently not draining well. The patient has shown improvement in septic shock, but still has fever, mildly increasing WBC count, and new neurological deficits. There are concerns about acute renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, and potential complications such as pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Poor mental status and neurological deficits: The patient's mental status has improved slightly, but he still has gross neurological deficits, including sensory level at T4 and complete paralysis of legs bilaterally. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of these deficits, with possible causes including hypoperfusion or embolic events.

2. Fever and increasing WBC count: The patient's fever and slightly elevated WBC count suggest an ongoing infection. The source of infection is unclear, but the gallbladder is a likely culprit. Surgical intervention may be necessary to address this issue and improve drainage.

3. Bilateral pleural effusions and consolidation in the right upper or middle lobe: These findings suggest possible pneumonia. Appropriate coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be initiated.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 2.0, which has"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Fevers: DDx gallbladder abscess: not draining by IR need to
   speak with Surgery about whether they would consider resection versus
   further attempt with IR. Add Vanco and get sputum versus BAL for data
   for PNA. TTE with bubble today to look for emboli, possible TEE in AM.
   2.        CHF: add back bblocker and Lasix
 goal 500 to 1000 cc
   negative
   3.       Resp Distress: likely PNA and volume overload and muscle
   weakness. Broaden ABX, get sputum, repeat ABG, low threshold for
   reintubation
   Remainder of issues as per Housestaff.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [**Male First Name (un)**] with a chief complaint of [**Chief Complaint**]. The patient's medical history includes allergies to Pneumovax 23, Allopurinol, and Hydralazine. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including Lasix, Protonix, and Heparin sodium.

24-hour events include obtaining sputum and blood cultures, administration of Lasix, insertion of a Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain, and replacement of the drain with a suction bulb. The patient also underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE), which showed no atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO).

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/51 mmHg to 156/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 97.5 kg and height is 72 inches.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,880 mL, including 71 mL through the NG tube, 911 mL through PO, and 829 mL through IV fluids. Output includes 2,060 mL of urine, with a negative fluid balance of -180 mL.

Laboratory results reveal a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 9.3 g/dL, blood glucose level of 124 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.7 mg/dL, and potassium (K+) level of 4.3 mEq/L. Other lab values include elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin T, and lactate levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes.

The patient remains on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other systems.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient continues to receive ICU care with ongoing monitoring and management of their condition. Nutritional support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are all part of the plan. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending further evaluation and improvement."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement. The patient's condition has improved well, with resolved septic shock, lactate levels decreasing, and good urine output. However, the patient continues to have a fever, mildly increasing white blood cell count, and significant bilateral pleural effusions with new consolidation in the right upper or middle lobe, raising concerns for possible pneumonia. The patient's neurological status has also shown improvement but still exhibits gross neurological deficits, including sensory level at T4 and apparent complete paralysis of both legs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of fever, increased white blood cell count, and new consolidation on chest imaging suggests a possible pneumonia infection.
2. Gallbladder-related issues: The patient's history of cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, along with poor drainage from the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube and gallbladder abscess/collection, may lead to further complications related to the gallbladder.
3. Neurological deficits: The patient's neurological status indicates multiple CNS deficits, including sensory level at T4 and apparent complete paralysis of the legs. These deficits could be due to infarcts caused by hypoperfusion or embolic events.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure secondary to CVVH for hyper"

","Summary:
The patient is a [**Last Name (un) 2053**]-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of allergies to allopurinol, hydralazine, and pneumovax 23. He was given Lasix 40 IV and his ABG results showed a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 48, PaO2 of 91, and HCO3 of 29. The patient underwent a TTE, which revealed no ASD or PFO. He has been on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 139/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological examination showed alertness, but he was not oriented to the month. He had decreased air movement throughout the lungs, particularly at the bases. The patient's extremities were distended and edematous. Laboratory results indicated elevated creatinine and lactate levels, as well as slightly low potassium levels. The patient's WBC count has fluctuated over the course of his admission. The patient's disposition is currently unknown. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's decreased air movement throughout the lungs, especially at the bases, suggests the possibility of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.

2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, along with the administration of multiple antibiotics, raises the concern for sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature, is crucial.

3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction. Monitoring urine output, electrolyte levels, and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is important.

4. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's distended and edematous extremities may suggest heart failure or cardiac dysfunction. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and any signs of fluid overload is essential.

5. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological examination findings, including disorientation and lack of toe wiggling, indicate potential neurological complications. Regular neurological assessments and monitoring for any changes in mental status are necessary.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and promptly address any complications that may arise to ensure optimal patient care."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who has developed new neurological deficits on MRI in the setting of new abnormalities on neuro exam. He has resolved septic shock, but is now experiencing fever and an increasing white blood cell count. The source of infection is unclear, with the gallbladder being a likely source, along with a known abscess/collection that is no longer draining well. The patient also has significant bilateral pleural effusions and new consolidation in the right upper or middle lobe, possibly indicating a new pneumonia. Other potential sources of infection include cardiac and spinal abscesses.

Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has new fevers and an increasing white blood cell count, indicating a possible ongoing infection.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions: The patient has significant bilateral pleural effusions, which may be due to infection or other causes.
3. Right upper or middle lobe consolidation: There is new consolidation in the right upper or middle lobe, which could indicate pneumonia.
4. Neurological deficits: The patient has developed multiple CNS deficits in the brain and spinal cord, with unclear etiology. Neurology suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts due to hypoperfusion, while some brain lesions are likely embolic.

   s/p perc tube placement with resolved Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis
   and new infartcs on MRI in setting of new abnormalities on neuro exam.
   .
   # Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.  Blood
   cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii.
   Hemodynamically stable. Last lactate 1.0. Percut cholecystostomy tube
   not draining anymore.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii. For 10 day
   course starting [**9-14**]
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance approx even as making good urine, and
   has good hemodynamics.
   - Source control via percutaneue cholecystostomy tube is not draining
   well, and US shows no sig change from previous.
   - Repeat US again today.
   - To IR for exchange of perc cholecystostomy tube for larger tube
   - Discuss with surgery plan if cannot drain gallbladder
   - discuss case with ERCP
   .
   # Fever: Pt w/ new fevers and WBC count trending upwards. Unclear
   source. Gallbladder is most likely as is known abcess/collection and no
   longer draining well. Will need to address w/ IR and surgery as
   mentioned above. Pt also with significant bilateral pleural effusions,
   as well as some new consolidation in the R upper or middle lobe. ? new
   PNA.  Additional sources to consider are cardiac (negative TTE and
   bubble study yesterday) and spinal abcess given high risk.
   - given tenuous status, will follow up on sputum cx, and cover for
   HAP/VAP with Vancomycin,. 750mg q 12. Vanc level this AM 19.3. continue
   to follow VANC levels, and adjust dose as needed.
   - Will discuss management of gallbladder with surgery above
   - will d/c vanc if sputum cx negative
   - Repeat MR of t-spine and L-spine to look for abcess and to assess for
   interval change
   - Consider LP to rule meningitis if other sources all negative
   - Consider TEE (after negative TTE)
   - ID recs: temp likey [**1-27**] poor gallbladder drainage, cannot exclude
   empyema, PE, needs improved drain output. LP/TEE, consider
   thoracentesis. Continue merepenem, no indication for vancomycin.
   # Poor mental status and neurological defecits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,
   whereas some of the brain lesions are likely embolic. Mental status
   significantly improved since extubation, but has plateaued . Pt awake
   but somnolent, able to respond to questions, able to follow commands,
   but w/ gross neurological deficits, including sensory level at T4, and
   apparent complete paralysis of legs bil.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who is now presenting with new neurological deficits. The patient's mental status has improved since extubation but has plateaued, and he is awake but somnolent. He is able to respond to questions and follow commands, but has gross neurological deficits including a sensory level at T4 and apparent complete paralysis of his legs bilaterally.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2 of 91 mmHg, HCO3- of 29 mEq/L, and BE of -1 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild/moderate rhonchi diffuse, loud wet upper airway sounds, very poor air movement at bases, and distant heart sounds. The patient also has a distended but soft abdomen with a midline surgical scar extending from the sternum to the pubis. There is 1+ pedal edema bilaterally, and the patient's extremities are cold and clammy.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Biliary Sepsis: we have had multiple discussions with IR,
   Surgery, and will involve ERCP in the best way to decompress this
   gallbladder. At present he will go for tube change to larger bore
   catheter by IR, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2233**] examined pt and confirmed that he is not an
   operative candidate and met with the family to clarify this, ERCP has
   been called and the question for them is the role of a nasobiliary
   drain to further decompress his biliary system.
   2.       Fevers: remaining DDx is PNA
 sputum cx sent and following
   serial CXR. Also line infection but blood cx have been negative to
   date.  Added empiric Vanco. Follow up cx. TTE with bubble negative for
   PFO
   3.       CHF: add back bblocker and Lasix
 goal 500 to 1000 cc
   negative
   Remainder of issues as per Housestaff.
   Of note spent 45 minutes meeting with family, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2233**], and
   arranging IR treatment in addition to care above for total crit. care

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of biliary sepsis. They have a history of allergies to certain medications and are currently receiving multiple IV infusions, including antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are being closely monitored, and they are receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance and hemodynamic status are also being tracked. Laboratory results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes. The patient is receiving nutritional support and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is set to full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Organ dysfunction: The patient's abnormal laboratory results suggest potential organ dysfunction, particularly in the liver and kidneys. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient's biliary sepsis indicates an existing infection. It is crucial to identify the causative organism and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly. Regular assessment for signs of infection and prompt treatment will be important.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events due to immobility and the presence of multiple IV lines. Prophylactic measures such as early mobilization and appropriate anticoagulation should be implemented.
4. Fluid management: The patient's fluid balance sheet"

","The patient is critically ill with biliary sepsis. They have been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem), pantoprazole, furosemide, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/55 mmHg to 119/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals that they are lying in bed, tachypneic but more alert, with coarse bilateral breath sounds and poor air movement. They have a drain in place for their abdomen, which is obese and shows signs of bowel sounds. The patient also has warm extremities and edema. Neurologically, they are able to answer simple questions but have no spontaneous movement in their lower extremities, moving their right arm better than yesterday.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 345 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 47 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 112 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging studies show no significant abnormalities.

The patient's condition is critical, and they require ongoing ICU care. They are on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate"

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement with resolved Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis
   and new infartcs on MRI in setting of new abnormalities on neuro exam.
   .
   # Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.  Blood
   cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii.
   Hemodynamically stable. Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube not draining
   anymore so was replaced for larger size but still not draining.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii. For 10 day
   course starting [**9-14**], will continue given recurrent fevers
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance 1 liter neg
   - Source control via percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is not draining
   well, and US shows no sig change from previous.
   - Will talk to IR about possible further interventions
   - Discuss with surgery again
   - will discuss case again with ERCP
   .
   # Fever: Pt w/ new fevers and WBC count trending down. Unclear source
   but most likely gallbladder given abcess/collection and no longer
   draining well. Will need to readdress w/ IR and surgery as mentioned
   above. Pt also with significant bilateral pleural effusions, as well as
   some new consolidation in the R upper or middle lobe. ? new PNA.
   Additional sources to consider are cardiac (negative TTE and bubble
   study yesterday) and spinal abcess given high risk.
   -  Will DC Vanco since not clearly treating any specific infection. If
   spikes or GPC speciated as staph, will restart.
   - Will discuss management of gallbladder with surgery above
   - Repeat MR of t-spine and L-spine to look for abcess and to assess for
   interval change
   - Consider LP to rule meningitis if other sources all negative if more
   stable
   - Consider TEE (after negative TTE)
   # Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,
   whereas some of the brain lesions are likely embolic. Mental status
   significantly improved since extubation . Pt awake but somnolent, able
   to respond to questions, able to follow commands, but w/ gross
   neurological deficits, including sensory level at T4, and apparent
   complete paralysis of legs bil. Etiologies likely hypercarbia (although
   none on recent ABGs) delirium, from multiple
   infarcts)
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - F/U repeat MR, consider TEE, LP
   .
   # Chest Pain: Pt c/o CP similar to CP he has at home. Possibly
   etiologies include UA, GI etiologies such as DES, GERD, PTX, PE. He was
   given Nitro with good effect, resolution.
   -          Check CXR
   -          Trend CEs. Will add on to afternoon labs (Had elevated trop
   before with prior NSTEMI so may be elevated from prior)
   -          On beta blocker. Will give ASA 325 x 1.
   -          Check ECG-> poor study but grossly unchanged from prior
   .
   # Acute renal failure s/p CVVH for hyperkalemia: baseline creatinine
   2.0. Cr 1.7 stable, improving.
   - monitor Cr
    .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Resolving, follow
   .
   # DM: SSI
   .
   # Gout: no acute issues, complaining of foot pain prior to admission,
   pain control prn when more alert
   .
   #CAD s/p CABG; CHF, HTN, BPH:
   -holding asa, statin, ace-i, lasix, prazosin in setting of septic shock
   -Metroprolol increased to 100 TID today, amlodipine restarted [**9-20**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who also has new infarcts on MRI and new neurological abnormalities. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Resolved septic shock: The patient previously had septic shock, likely due to cholecystitis, with blood cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter freundii. The patient is now hemodynamically stable.

2. Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube not draining: The percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, which was previously placed, is not draining well. This has been replaced with a larger size but still does not seem to be draining effectively. An ultrasound shows no significant change from previous findings.

3. Fever: The patient has new fevers and a decreasing WBC count. The source of the fever is unclear but most likely originates from the gallbladder, given the presence of an abscess/collection and the non-functioning cholecystostomy tube. Further evaluation by interventional radiology (IR) and surgery is needed to address this issue.

4. Bilateral pleural effusions and new consolidation in the right upper or middle lobe: The patient has significant bilateral pleural effusions, as well as some new consolidation in the right upper or middle lobe, which may indicate a possible new pneumonia. Additional sources to consider are cardiac (negative T"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He has had a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placed and was previously diagnosed with lactobacillus and citrobacter freundii sepsis, which has since resolved. However, the patient now presents with new neurological deficits, including sensory level at T4 and apparent complete paralysis of legs bilaterally. He also has significant bilateral pleural effusions and new consolidation in the right upper or middle lobe, raising suspicion for pneumonia. Other potential sources of infection include cardiac (negative TTE and bubble study yesterday) and spinal abscess given his high-risk status.

The patient's mental status has improved since extubation but has plateaued. He is awake but somnolent, able to respond to questions, and able to follow commands. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate 79 bpm, blood pressure 142/58 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures are negative. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and meropen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's chief complaint is a history of fever and respiratory symptoms. The patient underwent several diagnostic tests, including an abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cultures of sputum, urine, and stool. Additionally, an ERCP procedure was performed, but the team stated that there would be no added benefit for further interventions with a nasobiliary tube. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem), furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and respiratory symptoms suggest a possible infection. The results of the sputum, urine, and stool cultures are pending, which may provide more information about the type and source of infection. 
2. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) indicate potential kidney dysfunction. The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications, such as Vancomycin, should be taken into consideration. 
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST) suggest possible liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. 
4. Coagulation abnormalities: The patient's prolonged prothrom"

   1.       Biliary Sepsis: we have had multiple discussions with IR,
   Surgery, and will involve ERCP in the best way to decompress this
   gallbladder. New IR drain no more drainage, sludge is not amenable to
   draining further. Spoke with ERCP Attg who feel snasobiliary drain
   would not be helpful. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2233**] examined pt and confirmed that he is
   not an operative candidate. Asked Dr [**First Name (STitle) 404**] to see the pt to offer the
   family a second surgical opinion
   2.       Fevers: remaining DDx is bilairy source as above, PNA
 sputum
   cx sent and following serial CXR. Also line infection but blood cx have
   been negative to date.  Follow up cx. TEE when possible from resp
   status or if reintibated
   3.       Resp Distress: remains volume overloaded, trying diuresis,
   chest PT, suctioning prn, ABX. Follow up ABG and will need to consider
   re intubation if progressive hypercarbic failure
   4.       Neuro: CVA and ischemic spine injury
 follow up t spinr scan
 follow up with Neurology on prognosis
   5.       CHF: add back bblocker and Lasix
 goal 500 to 1000 cc
   negative
 improved oxtygenation with that.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with biliary sepsis and NSTEMI. The patient has been in the ICU and has had multiple discussions regarding the management of his biliary sepsis. It has been determined that he is not an operative candidate, and the best approach to decompress the gallbladder is through ERCP. The patient's fevers remain unexplained, with the main differential diagnosis being a biliary source or pneumonia. Blood cultures have been negative to date. The patient is also experiencing respiratory distress due to volume overload and is being treated with diuretics, chest PT, and suctioning as needed. ABX therapy is also being administered. The patient has a history of CVA and ischemic spine injury, and follow-up with neurology is planned. Additionally, the patient has congestive heart failure, for which a beta-blocker and Lasix have been added to the treatment plan. The patient's glycemic control and nutrition are being closely monitored. The patient's lines, prophylaxis, and communication with family members have also been noted. The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Biliary Sepsis: we have had multiple discussions with IR,
   Surgery, and will involve ERCP in the best way to decompress this
   gallbladder. At present he will go for tube change to larger bore
   catheter by IR, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2233**] examined pt and confirmed that he is not an
   operative candidate and met with the family to clarify this, ERCP has
   been called and the question for them is the role of a nasobiliary
   drain to further decompress his biliary system.
   2.       Fevers: remaining DDx is PNA
 sputum cx sent and following
   serial CXR. Also line infection but blood cx have been negative to
   date.  Added empiric Vanco. Follow up cx. TTE with bubble negative for
   PFO
   3.       Neuro: CVA and ischemic spine injury
 follow up t spinr scan
   4.       CHF: add back bblocker and Lasix
 goal 500 to 1000 cc
   negative
 improved oxtygenation with that.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing biliary sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/41 mmHg to 137/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and antibiotics such as meropenem and vancomycin.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range. Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal kidney function (TCO2), and altered blood electrolytes (Na+/K+).

Imaging studies reveal a distended gallbladder with heterogeneous material, suggesting gallbladder stones or sludge. Microbiology tests on bile samples show the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC), indicating a bacterial infection in the biliary system.

The assessment and plan include management of biliary sepsis through decompression of the gallbladder, potentially using an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with nasobiliary drain. Additionally, the patient's fevers may be due to"

   MRI-Thorax read: 1. No significant change in the appearance of
   increased signal intensity within the cord extending from T6
   inferiorly. Subtle enhancement may be slightly increased. Given the
   clinical history, with sudden onset neurologic
   deficit and little clinical or radiographic improvement, this is
   consistent with spinal cord infarction. However, the differential for
   these findings is broad and includes infectious, inflammatory, and
   demyelinating processes.  2. Increased signal in the lower thoracic
   vertebral bodies as described above unchanged from prior study. Bone
   scan may be helpful.

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement with resolved Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis
   and new infarcts on MRI and new abnormalities on neuro exam with
   persistent low grade fevers.
   .
   # Cholecystitis/Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely
   source.  Blood cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii
   with repeat blood cx NGTD. Hemodynamically stable. Percutaneous
   cholecystostomy tube not draining anymore so was replaced for larger
   size but still not draining.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii. Per ID,
   will need 2 week course after definitive drainage procedure.
   - Source control via percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is not draining
   well, previous US shows no sig change from previous, but will repeat
   today.
   - Will talk to IR, surgery about possible further interventions
   - Consider surgery: Second opinion obtained. Will follow up final recs
   after US done and read
   .
   # Fever: Pt w/ new fevers. Unclear source but most likely gallbladder
   given abcess/collection and no longer draining well. Will need to
   readdress w/ IR and surgery as mentioned above. Pt also with small
   right pleural effusions, as well as some consolidation in the R middle
   lobe on CT. Additional sources to consider are cardiac with clinical
   picture of septic emboli although he has not had sustained bacteremia
   and repeat blood cx no growth. No evidence of vegon TTE. Focal abscess
   not seen on MRI. Meningitis unlikely given lack of meningeal symptoms.
   However has abnomal root anheancement which is concerning for
   infectious vs. inflammatory etiologies. Patient may also have right
   sided effusion from gallbladder infection and tap could help identify
   cause of infection.
   - Vanco DC
d since not clearly treating any specific infection with
   vanco. If spikes or GPC from abscess speciated as staph, will restart.
   - Will discuss management of gallbladder with surgery above
   - Repeat MR of t-spine and L-spine to look for abcess and to assess for
   interval change
   - Consider LP to rule meningitis if other sources all negative when
   more stable
   - Consider TEE in future but would not acutely change management since
   are continuing antibiotics
   - Will call lab to speciate bacteria from abscess cx and will discuss
   antibiotics with ID regarding need to broaded spectrum of coverage
   given low grade fevers
   - Will attempt ultrasound guided thoracentesis this afternoon if able.
   If difficult to visualize effusion, will consider consulting IR or IP
   for assistance
   .
   # Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,
   whereas some of the brain lesions are most likely embolic. Mental
   status significantly improved since extubation . Pt awake but
   somnolent, able to respond to questions, able to follow commands, but
   w/ gross neurological deficits, including sensory level at T4, and
   apparent complete paralysis of legs bil. Most likely etiology is
   impairment from multiple infarcts as well as delirium from infection,
   ICU stay.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - Consider LP today to assess for demyelinating process
   - ? Need for bone scan based on recs from rads
   .
   # Chest Pain: Pt c/o CP similar to CP he has at home. Possibly
   etiologies include UA, GI etiologies such as DES, GERD, PTX, PE. He was
   given Nitro with good effect, resolution. CP now resolved. Biomarkers
   trending down. No PTX on CXR.
   -          Trended CEs. Trop still elevated from prior NSTEMI
   -          On beta [**Last Name (LF) 1463**], [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   .
   # Acute renal failure s/p CVVH for hyperkalemia: Creatinine continues
   to improve. Baseline 2.0. Now Cr 1.5.
   - monitor Cr
    .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Resolving, follow

   .
   # FEN:  Had eval by speech and swallow: Keep NPO w/ TFs, meds should be
   crushed for TF or IV. Hypernatremic today. Free water deficit
   calculated as 3.2 Liters. Goal decrease 0.5mEq/L/hr.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with chest pain and had labs drawn, an EKG obtained, and sublingual nitro with good relief. An MRI of the thorax showed no significant change in the appearance of increased signal intensity within the cord extending from T6 inferiorly, with subtle enhancement that may be slightly increased. This is consistent with spinal cord infarction, but the differential diagnosis includes infectious, inflammatory, and demyelinating processes. The patient has a history of allergies to pneumovax, allopurinol, and hydralazine. Antibiotics were administered, including vancomycin and meropenem. The patient received various infusions such as furosemide, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/61 mmHg to 119/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight was 97.5 kg, and fluid balance showed a total intake of 1,225 mL and total output of 2,370 mL. The patient was receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen. Peripheral pulses were not assessed, and the patient had no skin or neurologic examination due to being unresponsive. Lab results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin"

   pt with chest pain, labs drawn, EKG obtained, SL NITRO with good
   relief, team aware, see vitals
   PICC Line replaced, appropriately positioned
   MRI-Thorax read: 1. No significant change in the appearance of
   increased signal intensity
   within the cord extending from T6 inferiorly. Subtle enhancement may be
   slightly increased. Given the clinical history, with sudden onset
   neurologic
   deficit and little clinical or radiographic improvement, this is
   consistent
   with spinal cord infarction. However, the differential for these
   findings is
   broad and includes infectious, inflammatory, and demyelinating
   processes.
   2. Increased signal in the lower thoracic vertebral bodies as described
   above unchanged from prior study. Bone scan may be helpful.

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement with resolved Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis
   and new infartcs on MRI in setting of new abnormalities on neuro exam.
   .
   # Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.  Blood
   cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii.
   Hemodynamically stable. Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube not draining
   anymore so was replaced for larger size but still not draining.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii. For 10 day
   course starting [**9-14**], will continue given recurrent fevers
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance 1 liter neg
   - Source control via percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is not draining
   well, and US shows no sig change from previous.
   - Will talk to IR about possible further interventions
   - Discuss with surgery again
   - will discuss case again with ERCP
   .
   # Fever: Pt w/ new fevers and WBC count trending down. Unclear source
   but most likely gallbladder given abcess/collection and no longer
   draining well. Will need to readdress w/ IR and surgery as mentioned
   above. Pt also with significant bilateral pleural effusions, as well as
   some new consolidation in the R upper or middle lobe. ? new PNA.
   Additional sources to consider are cardiac (negative TTE and bubble
   study yesterday) and spinal abcess given high risk.
   -  Will DC Vanco since not clearly treating any specific infection. If
   spikes or GPC speciated as staph, will restart.
   - Will discuss management of gallbladder with surgery above
   - Repeat MR of t-spine and L-spine to look for abcess and to assess for
   interval change
   - Consider LP to rule meningitis if other sources all negative if more
   stable
   - Consider TEE (after negative TTE)
   # Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,
   whereas some of the brain lesions are likely embolic. Mental status
   significantly improved since extubation . Pt awake but somnolent, able
   to respond to questions, able to follow commands, but w/ gross
   neurological deficits, including sensory level at T4, and apparent
   complete paralysis of legs bil. Etiologies likely hypercarbia (although
   none on recent ABGs) delirium, from multiple
   infarcts)
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - F/U repeat MR, consider TEE, LP
   .
   # Chest Pain: Pt c/o CP similar to CP he has at home. Possibly
   etiologies include UA, GI etiologies such as DES, GERD, PTX, PE. He was
   given Nitro with good effect, resolution.
   -          Check CXR
   -          Trend CEs. Will add on to afternoon labs (Had elevated trop
   before with prior NSTEMI so may be elevated from prior)
   -          On beta blocker. Will give ASA 325 x 1.
   -          Check ECG-> poor study but grossly unchanged from prior
   .
   # Acute renal failure s/p CVVH for hyperkalemia: baseline creatinine
   2.0. Cr 1.7 stable, improving.
   - monitor Cr
    .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Resolving, follow
   .
   # DM: SSI
   .
   # Gout: no acute issues, complaining of foot pain prior to admission,
   pain control prn when more alert

   #CAD s/p CABG; CHF, HTN, BPH:
   -holding asa, statin, ace-i, lasix, prazosin in setting of septic shock
   -Metroprolol increased to 100 TID today, amlodipine restarted [**9-20**]

   MRI-Thorax read: 1. No significant change in the appearance of
   increased signal intensity within the cord extending from T6
   inferiorly. Subtle enhancement may be slightly increased. Given the
   clinical history, with sudden onset neurologic
   deficit and little clinical or radiographic improvement, this is
   consistent with spinal cord infarction. However, the differential for
   these findings is broad and includes infectious, inflammatory, and
   demyelinating processes.  2. Increased signal in the lower thoracic
   vertebral bodies as described above unchanged from prior study. Bone
   scan may be helpful.

   # Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely source.  Blood
   cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii.
   Hemodynamically stable. Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube not draining
   anymore so was replaced for larger size but still not draining.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii. For 10 day
   course starting [**9-14**], will continue given recurrent fevers
   - Attempt to keep fluid balance 1 liter neg
   - Source control via percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is not draining

   # Fever: Pt w/ new fevers and WBC count trending down. Unclear source
   but most likely gallbladder given abcess/collection and no longer
   draining well. Will need to readdress w/ IR and surgery as mentioned
   above. Pt also with significant bilateral pleural effusions, as well as
   some new consolidation in the R upper or middle lobe. ? new PNA.
   Additional sources to consider are cardiac (negative TTE and bubble
   study yesterday) and spinal abcess given high risk.
   -  Will DC Vanco since not clearly treating any specific infection. If
   spikes or GPC speciated as staph, will restart.
   - Will discuss management of gallbladder with surgery above
   - Repeat MR of t-spine and L-spine to look for abcess and to assess for
   interval change
   - Consider LP to rule meningitis if other sources all negative if more
   stable
   - Consider TEE (after negative TTE)
   # Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,
   whereas some of the brain lesions are likely embolic. Mental status
   significantly improved since extubation . Pt awake but somnolent, able
   to respond to questions, able to follow commands, but w/ gross

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, who was admitted for septic shock. He has undergone percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement and is currently in the ICU. The patient's recent MRI shows new infarcts on the brain and spinal cord, indicating neurological deficits. He also has significant bilateral pleural effusions and consolidation in the right upper or middle lobe, suggesting a possible new pneumonia. The patient's mental status has improved since extubation, but he still has gross neurological deficits including sensory level at T4 and apparent complete paralysis of legs bilaterally. The possible etiologies for his neurological deficits include hypercarbia, delirium from multiple infarcts, or spinal abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis indicates a previous infection. Additionally, he had septic shock due to lactobacillus and Citrobacter sepsis. His current fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible ongoing infection, which could be related to the gallbladder or pneumonia.
2. Neurological Deficits: The patient's MRI findings indicate new infarcts in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in neurological deficits. The sensory level at T4 and apparent complete paralysis of legs bilaterally are concerning and require further evaluation and management.
3. Pleural Effusion and"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Biliary sepsis: veryy complicated situation with IR and 2
   surgical teams following. Goal is definitive drainage which IR drains
   have not accomplished and surgery is very high risk. Repeat Abd US
   today to see if more dilated. If so questin another IR drain, surgical
   placement of drain or high risk OR case. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 2290**] [**Last Name (un) **] fluid up micro
   on biliary drain.
   2.       Neurologic
 CVA looks embolic, also spinal infarcts. Possible
   LP to look for fluid
   3.       Effussion: pleural effusion likely symphathetic in response to
   infected gallbladder below- could there be perf and 2bdry infection.
   Check with US for extent of pleural fluid.
   4.        Angina: no acute ECG changes responded to MSO4, nitro
   hemodynamics stable
   5.       Hypoxemia: poor air movement volume overload evolving RLL

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple health conditions, including biliary sepsis, NSTEMI (Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction), and spinal infarcts. The patient is currently in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and has been experiencing chest pain. The patient has allergies to certain medications such as Pneumovax 23, Allopurinol, and Hydralazine. They are currently receiving multiple medications, including morphine sulfate for pain relief, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the addition of chest pain. The patient's physical examination reveals that they are lying in bed, minimally responsive, tachypneic (increased respiratory rate), with poor air movement at the right base of the chest, distended abdomen, and minimal edema in the extremities. Neurologically, the patient is not following commands and is only responding somewhat to family presence, with movement of both arms but no legs.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased"

   Imaging: [**9-26**] GB US - IMPRESSION: Increased gallbladder distention and
   intraluminal debris, despite
   the presence of an upsized drain.
   Findings were discussed with the CT interventional and vascular
   interventional
   radiology services. It is not felt that the drain can be safely further
   upsized for adequate drainage at this time, given several recent
   upsizing
   procedures. Surgical consultation is recommended. Findings and
   recommendations were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 385**] at the conclusion of
   the
   exam.

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement with resolved Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis
   and new infarcts on MRI and new abnormalities on neuro exam with
   persistent low grade fevers.
   .
   # Cholecystitis/Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely
   source.  Blood cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii
   with repeat blood cx NGTD. Hemodynamically stable. Percutaneous
   cholecystostomy tube not draining anymore so was replaced for larger
   size but still not draining.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii. Per ID,
   will need 2 week course after definitive drainage procedure.
   - Source control via percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is not draining
   well, previous US shows no sig change from previous, but will repeat
   today.
   - Will talk to IR, surgery about possible further interventions
   - Consider surgery: Second opinion obtained. Will follow up final recs
   after US done and read
   .
   # Fever: Pt w/ new fevers. Unclear source but most likely gallbladder
   given abcess/collection and no longer draining well. Will need to
   readdress w/ IR and surgery as mentioned above. Pt also with small
   right pleural effusions, as well as some consolidation in the R middle
   lobe on CT. Additional sources to consider are cardiac with clinical
   picture of septic emboli although he has not had sustained bacteremia
   and repeat blood cx no growth. No evidence of vegon TTE. Focal abscess
   not seen on MRI. Meningitis unlikely given lack of meningeal symptoms.
   However has abnomal root anheancement which is concerning for
   infectious vs. inflammatory etiologies. Patient may also have right
   sided effusion from gallbladder infection and tap could help identify
   cause of infection.
   - Vanco DC
d since not clearly treating any specific infection with
   vanco. If spikes or GPC from abscess speciated as staph, will restart.
   - Will discuss management of gallbladder with surgery above
   - Repeat MR of t-spine and L-spine to look for abcess and to assess for
   interval change
   - Consider LP to rule meningitis if other sources all negative when
   more stable
   - Consider TEE in future but would not acutely change management since
   are continuing antibiotics
   - Will call lab to speciate bacteria from abscess cx and will discuss
   antibiotics with ID regarding need to broaded spectrum of coverage
   given low grade fevers
   - Will attempt ultrasound guided thoracentesis this afternoon if able.
   If difficult to visualize effusion, will consider consulting IR or IP
   for assistance
   .
   # Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,
   whereas some of the brain lesions are most likely embolic. Mental
   status significantly improved since extubation . Pt awake but
   somnolent, able to respond to questions, able to follow commands, but
   w/ gross neurological deficits, including sensory level at T4, and
   apparent complete paralysis of legs bil. Most likely etiology is
   impairment from multiple infarcts as well as delirium from infection,
   ICU
   stay.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - Consider LP today to assess for demyelinating process

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, and sepsis. There is also an abscess identified in the gallbladder, and cultures have shown growth of lactobacillus and citrobacter freundii. The patient may develop further infections due to their compromised immune system.

2. Neurological deficits: The patient has multiple CNS deficits, including sensory level at T4 and apparent complete paralysis of legs bilaterally. These deficits could be attributed to infarcts in the brain and spinal cord, likely caused by impaired blood flow.

3. Renal failure: The patient experienced acute renal failure and required continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for hyperkalemia. Although the creatinine levels are improving, close monitoring of renal function is necessary.

4. Liver enzyme abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to hypoperfusion or other underlying conditions. Regular monitoring of liver function is important.

5. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient is currently on metoprolol and amlodipine, and it is crucial to manage"

   # Cholecystitis/Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely
   source.  Blood cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii
   with repeat blood cx NGTD. Hemodynamically stable. Percutaneous
   cholecystostomy tube not draining anymore so was replaced for larger
   size but still not draining.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii. Per ID,
   will need 2 week course after definitive drainage procedure.
   - Source control via percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is not draining
   well, previous US shows no sig change from previous, but will repeat
   today.
   - Surgery consult: Second opinion obtained. No plans for surgical
   intervention at this time due to pt high risk status.
   .
   # Fever: Pt w/ new fevers. Unclear source but most likely gallbladder
   given abcess/collection and no longer draining well. Will need to
   readdress w/ IR and surgery as mentioned above. Pt also with small
   right pleural effusions, as well as some consolidation in the R middle
   lobe on CT. Additional sources to consider are cardiac with clinical
   picture of septic emboli although he has not had sustained bacteremia
   and repeat blood cx no growth. No evidence of vegon TTE. Focal abscess
   not seen on MRI. Meningitis unlikely given lack of meningeal symptoms.
   Patient may also have right sided effusion from gallbladder infection
   and tap could help identify cause of infection.
   - Continue vanc and meropenem for biliary source
   - Consider TEE in future but would not acutely change management since
   are continuing antibiotics
   - Will call lab to speciate bacteria from abscess cx and will discuss
   antibiotics with ID regarding need to broaded spectrum of coverage
   given low grade fevers
   - Consider ultrasound guided thoracentesis this if pt develops
   recurrent fevers

   # Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He had a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placed but it is not draining well. The ultrasound shows increased gallbladder distention and intraluminal debris. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for a Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis and continues to be on vancomycin and meropenem. There are no plans for surgical intervention at this time due to the patient's high risk status.

The patient is also experiencing new fevers, small right pleural effusions, and consolidation in the right middle lobe on CT. This could be due to a biliary source, cardiac septic emboli, or other sources such as meningitis or a right-sided effusion from gallbladder infection. Antibiotics have been continued, and further evaluation and discussion with the ID doctor are planned.

The patient has poor mental status and neurological deficits with multiple CNS deficits in the brain and spinal cord, unclear etiology. The spinal lesions are likely infarcts due to hypoperfusion, while some brain lesions are most likely embolic. Mental status has significantly improved since extubation.

The patient complains of chest pain similar to what he experiences at home, possibly due to UA, GI etiologies, or PE. Nitro was given with good effect, resolving the pain. Biomarkers are trending down"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Biliary sepsis: very complicated situation with IR and 2
   surgical teams following. Goal is definitive drainage which IR drains
   have not accomplished and surgery is very high risk. At present after
   conversation with 3 IR teams, DR [**Last Name (STitle) 2233**] and Dr [**First Name (STitle) 404**], we have
   arrived at long term medical management with Vanco and Meropenem, close
   monitoring and will try to obtain mono octanoic acid for lysis of
   biliary sludge.
   2.       Neurologic
 CVA looks embolic, also spinal infarcts. Stable
   exam. More alert today. Hold off on TEE as not a surgical candidate and
   no plan to stop ABX for many weeks so would not change management.
   3.       Effussion: pleural effusion likely symphathetic in response to
   infected gallbladder below- could there be perf and 2bdry infection.
   Looks better today and no fevers so would hol doff on tap for now. Much
   imprpoved resp status after Mt suctioning
   4.        Angina: no acute ECG changes responded to MSO4, nitro
   hemodynamics stable

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with biliary sepsis. The patient has a history of allergies to Pneumovax 23, Allopurinol, and Hydralazine. They were started on antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Meropenem, and are currently being monitored closely. The goal is to achieve definitive drainage of the biliary system, as previous attempts by interventional radiology (IR) have not been successful. Surgery is considered high risk at this time. The patient is also being managed for neurologic complications, including a possible embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and spinal infarcts. A thoracic effusion is present, likely in response to the infected gallbladder, but no immediate intervention is planned as the patient's respiratory status has improved. The patient also experienced episodes of angina, which responded to medical management without acute ECG changes. The patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeding and is being closely monitored for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Biliary Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by biliary sepsis, which can lead to systemic infection and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed appropriately."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of biliary sepsis. The patient's condition is complicated and involves interactions with interventional radiology (IR) and surgical teams. The goal is to achieve definitive drainage, as previous IR drains have not been successful and surgical placement of a drain or high-risk operation is considered. An abdominal ultrasound was performed today to assess if there is further dilation, and if so, another IR drain may be attempted or surgical placement of a drain might be necessary.

The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the noted updates above and below.

Vital signs:
- Temperature (Tmax): 37.8°C (100.7°F), current temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
- Heart rate (HR): 65 bpm (normal range: 65-104 bpm)
- Blood pressure (BP): 120/54 mmHg (116/46-132/63 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate (RR): 21 breaths per minute (normal range: 18-33 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 99% on face tent

The patient's weight is currently 97.5 kg, with an admission weight of 90.2 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,845 mL and a total output of 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old man with biliary sepsis from necrotic gallbladder.  Source
   control has not been possible, though he has reportedly improved on
   conservative therapy.  Fever curve is very slightly down.
   1.       Biliary sepsis: very complicated situation with IR and 2
   surgical teams following. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 385**]
s note:
Goal is
   definitive drainage which IR drains have not accomplished and surgery
   is very high risk. At present after conversation with 3 IR teams, Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2233**] and Dr [**First Name (STitle) 404**], we have arrived at long term medical
   management with Vanco and Meropenem, close monitoring and will try to
   obtain mono octanoic acid for lysis of biliary sludge.
   We will
   continue present antibiotics.
   2.       Neurologic
 Mental status/alertness is improved, though
   ?expressive aphasia persists.  CVA is possibly embolic, and there are
   spinal infarcts.  Holding off on TEE as not a surgical candidate and
   will not stop ABX for many weeks (so would not change management).
   3.       Effusion: pleural effusion is most likely symphathetic in
   response to infected gallbladder below.  Seems to be improving so will
   hold off on thoracentesis for now.
   4.       CAD/NSTEMI: continue current rx
   5.  Check Doppler of RUE for swelling

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with biliary sepsis from a necrotic gallbladder. He has been improving on conservative therapy, but source control has not been possible. The goal is definitive drainage, which interventional radiology (IR) drains have not accomplished. Surgery is considered high risk at present. The patient is currently being managed with long-term medical management using Vancomycin and Meropenem, close monitoring, and attempting to obtain mono octanoic acid for lysis of biliary sludge. The patient also has neurologic issues, including mental status/alertness improvement but persistent expressive aphasia, possibly due to embolic CVA and spinal infarcts. He is not a surgical candidate, so a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is being held off. The patient also has a pleural effusion that is likely sympathetic in response to the infected gallbladder, which is improving. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which he is continuing current medication. The patient has right upper extremity swelling, and a Doppler will be checked for it. In the ICU, the patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being managed, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being implemented, and the patient's code status is full"

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement with Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis
   .
   # Cholecystitis/Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely
   source.  Blood cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii
   with repeat blood cx NGTD. Hemodynamically stable. Percutaneous
   cholecystostomy tube not draining anymore so was replaced for larger
   size but still not draining. IR unable to offer any additional therapy.
   Two surgical attendings have consulted regarding surgery and determined
   that he is too high risk, and should be managed conservatively. New cx
   data from cholecystostomy drain, shows enterococcus.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii. Per ID,
   will need 2 week course after definitive drainage procedure.
   - Add Vanco, given enterococcus in bile.
   - Source control via percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is not draining
   well, previous US shows no sig change from previous. Repeat US on [**9-26**]
   again shows increasing distension and no change in debris collection
   despite larger drain.
   - Surgery second opinion obtained. No plans for surgical intervention
   at this time due to pt high risk status.
   - Pt doing much better today, more alert, sitting in chair, speaking
   better. Family has expressed interest in having him reevaluated as
   surgical candidate. Will discuss w/ surgery.
   .
   # Fever: Pt has not had fevers for past 24h, though still had low grade
   in last 48 hours.  Most likely source is still gallbladder given
   abcess/collection and no longer draining well. Pt also with pleural
   effusions, as well as some consolidation in the R middle lobe on CT,
   but O2 sats are good and lung exam improving, argue against an
   untreated PNA. Additional sources to consider are cardiac with clinical
   picture of septic emboli from cerebral infarcts, although he has not
   had sustained bacteremia and repeat blood cx no growth. No evidence of
   vegon TTE. Focal abscess not seen on MRI. Meningitis unlikely given
   lack of meningeal symptoms. Patient may also have right sided effusion
   from gallbladder infection and tap could help identify cause of
   infection.
   - Continue vanc and meropenem for biliary source
   - Consider TEE in future but would not acutely change management since
   are continuing antibiotics
   - Consider ultrasound guided thoracentesis this if pt develops
   recurrent fevers
   .
   # Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,
   whereas some of the brain lesions are most likely embolic. Mental
   status significantly improving since extubation .  Will continue to
   monitor.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - ? Need for bone scan based on recs from rads
   .
   # Chest Pain: Pt had previous complaints of CP similar to CP he has at
   home. Possibly etiologies include UA, GI etiologies such as DES, GERD,
   PTX, PE. He was given Nitro with good effect, resolution. CP now
   resolved. Biomarkers trending down. No PTX on CXR. No further CP.
   -          Trended CEs. Trop still elevated from prior NSTEMI, but
   trending downward.
   -          On beta [**Last Name (LF) 1463**], [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   .
   # Acute renal failure s/p CVVH for hyperkalemia: Creatinine has been
   stable at 1.5-1.6, unclear baseline.
   - monitor Cr
    .
   RUE swelling:  noticed some RUE swelling today, with 2+ pitting edema
   in the right hand.
   - RUE US to assess for DVT: negative.
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Resolving, follow
   .
   # DM: SSI
   .
   # Gout: no acute issues, complaining of foot pain prior to admission,
   pain control prn when more alert
   .
   #CAD s/p CABG; CHF, HTN, BPH:
   -On [**Month/Day (2) **], metoprolol, amlodipine; holding statin, ace-i, lasix, prazosin
   -Metroprolol increased to 100 TID today, amlodipine restarted [**9-20**]
   .
   # FEN:  Had eval by speech and swallow: Keep NPO w/ TFs, meds should be
   crushed for TF or IV. Hypernatremic today. Free water deficit
   calculated as 3.2 Liters. Goal decrease 0.5mEq/L/hr.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including sepsis caused by Lactobacillus and Citrobacter freundii, fever, poor mental status, neurological deficits, chest pain, acute renal failure, right upper extremity swelling, elevated liver enzymes, diabetes mellitus, gout, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and feeding tube (FT) placement. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and he is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. He is being monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced sepsis due to Lactobacillus and Citrobacter freundii. It is crucial to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen as necessary.
2. Poor mental status and neurological deficits: The patient's mental status is improving since extubation, but he still has neurological deficits. Further evaluation and monitoring are required, including ongoing communication with neurology for recommendations.
3. Chest pain: The patient had previous complaints of chest pain similar to what he experiences at home. Although his current chest pain has resolved, it is important to consider various etiologies such as unstable angina (UA),"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU. He was initially diagnosed with septic shock and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 119/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His NG tube has been inserted due to difficulty swallowing solid foods.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and an elevated platelet count. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits, indicating normal kidney function. The electrolyte levels are also within normal range.

The patient's chest X-ray on 09/23/20 shows a left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Subsequent chest X-rays show improvement in the infiltrate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with pneumonia, which is a lung infection. The presence of infiltrates on the chest X-ray indicates the severity of the infection. Complications such as septic shock, respiratory failure, or pleural effusion can occur if the infection worsens.

2. Septic Shock: The patient's initial diagnosis was septic shock, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement with Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis
   .
   # Cholecystitis/Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely
   source.  Blood cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter [**Telephone/Fax (3) **]
   with repeat blood cx NGTD. Hemodynamically stable. Percutaneous
   cholecystostomy tube not draining anymore so was replaced for larger
   size but still not draining. IR unable to offer any additional therapy.
   Two surgical attendings have consulted regarding surgery and determined
   that he is too high risk, and should be managed conservatively. New cx
   data from cholecystostomy drain, shows enterococcus [**Last Name (un) 270**] to vanc.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter [**Last Name (un) 2387**]. Per ID,
   will need 2 week course after definitive drainage procedure.
   - Continue Vanco, given enterococcus in bile.
   - Source control via percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is not draining
   well, previous US shows no sig change from previous. Repeat US on [**9-26**]
   again shows increasing distension and no change in debris collection
   despite larger drain.
   - Pt doing much better today, more alert, sitting in chair, speaking
   better. Family has expressed interest in having him reevaluated as
   surgical candidate. Will discuss w/ surgery.
   .
   # Fever: Pt has been afebrile  past 24h.  Most likely source is still
   gallbladder given abcess/collection and no longer draining well. Pt
   also with pleural effusions, as well as some consolidation in the R
   middle lobe on CT, but O2 sats are good on nasal cannula and lung exam
   improving, argue against an untreated PNA. Additional sources to
   consider are cardiac with clinical picture of septic emboli from
   cerebral infarcts, although he has not had sustained bacteremia and
   repeat blood cx no growth. No evidence of veg on TTE. Focal abscess not
   seen on MRI. Meningitis unlikely given lack of meningeal symptoms.
   Patient may also have right sided effusion from gallbladder infection
   and tap could help identify cause of infection.
   - Continue vanc and meropenem for biliary source
   - Consider TEE in future but would not acutely change management since
   are continuing antibiotics
   - Consider ultrasound guided thoracentesis this if pt develops
   recurrent fevers

   # Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,
   whereas some of the brain lesions are most likely embolic. Mental
   status significantly improving since extubation .  Will continue to
   monitor.

   # Chest Pain: Pt had previous complaints of CP similar to CP he has at
   home. Possibly etiologies include UA, GI etiologies such as DES, GERD,
   PTX, PE. He was given Nitro with good effect, resolution. CP now
   resolved. Biomarkers trending down. No PTX on CXR. No further CP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He had a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placed but it is not draining well. Blood cultures showed lactobacillus and Citrobacter, with repeat blood cultures negative. Enterococcus was found in the bile. The patient's fever has subsided, but he still has pleural effusions and consolidation in the right middle lobe. There is no evidence of vegetations on TTE, and focal abscess was not seen on MRI. The patient also has right upper extremity swelling, which is being evaluated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis due to lactobacillus and Citrobacter, and now enterococcus in the bile. There is a risk of ongoing infection or development of new infections.
2. Poor mental status and neurological deficits: The patient has multiple CNS deficits in the brain and spinal cord, with unclear etiology. Neurology suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts due to hypoperfusion, while some brain lesions may be embolic.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient had CVVH for hyperkalemia, but creatinine levels have been stable at 1.5-1.6, unclear baseline. Monitoring of creatinine is ongoing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis. He has undergone percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement but is not draining well. Blood cultures show lactobacillus and Citrobacter species. The patient is hemodynamically stable but has poor air movement bilaterally with consolidation in the right middle lobe on CT scan. There are also pleural effusions present. The patient's mental status has improved since extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures show lactobacillus and Citrobacter species, indicating a potential bacterial infection. The presence of fever and consolidation on the CT scan suggests a possible pneumonia. Additionally, the patient's poor air movement bilaterally and pleural effusions may indicate a pulmonary infection or effusion.
2. Gallbladder issues: The patient has a history of cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis, suggesting ongoing gallbladder inflammation or infection. The non-draining percutaneous cholecystostomy tube could contribute to ongoing infection and abscess formation.
3. Neurological deficits: The patient exhibits multiple CNS deficits in the brain and spinal cord, which may be due to infarcts or embolic events. The patient's mental status has improved since extubation, but continued monitoring is required.

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with recent admission for cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis
   s/p perc tube placement with Lactobacillus/Citrobacter sepsis
   .
   # Cholecystitis/Resolved septic shock:  Cholecystitis is the likely
   source.  Blood cultures showing lactobacillus and Citrobacter Freundii
   with repeat blood cx NGTD. Hemodynamically stable. Percutaneous
   cholecystostomy tube not draining anymore so was replaced for larger
   size but still not draining. IR unable to offer any additional therapy.
   Two surgical attendings have consulted regarding surgery and determined
   that he is too high risk, and should be managed conservatively. New cx
   data from cholecystostomy drain, shows enterococcus.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for lactobacillis and citrobacter freundii. Per ID,
   will need 2 week course after definitive drainage procedure.
   - Add Vanco, given enterococcus in bile.
   - Source control via percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is not draining
   well, previous US shows no sig change from previous. Repeat US on [**9-26**]
   again shows increasing distension and no change in debris collection
   despite larger drain.
   - Surgery second opinion obtained. No plans for surgical intervention
   at this time due to pt high risk status.
   - Pt doing much better today, more alert, sitting in chair, speaking
   better. Family has expressed interest in having him reevaluated as
   surgical candidate. Will discuss w/ surgery.
   .
   # Fever: Pt has not had fevers for past 24h, though still had low grade
   in last 48 hours.  Most likely source is still gallbladder given
   abcess/collection and no longer draining well. Pt also with pleural
   effusions, as well as some consolidation in the R middle lobe on CT,
   but O2 sats are good and lung exam improving, argue against an
   untreated PNA. Additional sources to consider are cardiac with clinical
   picture of septic emboli from cerebral infarcts, although he has not
   had sustained bacteremia and repeat blood cx no growth. No evidence of
   vegon TTE. Focal abscess not seen on MRI. Meningitis unlikely given
   lack of meningeal symptoms. Patient may also have right sided effusion
   from gallbladder infection and tap could help identify cause of
   infection.
   - Continue vanc and meropenem for biliary source
   - Consider TEE in future but would not acutely change management since
   are continuing antibiotics
   - Consider ultrasound guided thoracentesis this if pt develops
   recurrent fevers
   .
   # Poor mental status and neurological deficits:  Pt w/ multiple CNS
   deficits in brain, and spinal cord, unclear etiology though Neurology
   suggests that the spinal lesions are likely infarcts [**1-27**] hypoperfusion,
   whereas some of the brain lesions are most likely embolic. Mental
   status significantly improving since extubation .  Will continue to
   monitor.
   - neuro following, appreciate recs
   - ? Need for bone scan based on recs from rads
   .
   # Chest Pain: Pt had previous complaints of CP similar to CP he has at
   home. Possibly etiologies include UA, GI etiologies such as DES, GERD,
   PTX, PE. He was given Nitro with good effect, resolution. CP now
   resolved. Biomarkers trending down. No PTX on CXR. No further CP.
   -          Trended CEs. Trop still elevated from prior NSTEMI, but
   trending downward.
   -          On beta [**Last Name (LF) 1463**], [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   .
   # Acute renal failure s/p CVVH for hyperkalemia: Creatinine has been
   stable at 1.5-1.6, unclear baseline.
   - monitor Cr
    .
   RUE swelling:  noticed some RUE swelling today, with 2+ pitting edema
   in the right hand.
   - RUE US to assess for DVT: negative.
   .
   # Elevated liver enzymes
   - likely [**1-27**] hypoperfusion.
   - Resolving, follow
   .
   # DM: SSI
   .
   # Gout: no acute issues, complaining of foot pain prior to admission,
   pain control prn when more alert
   .
   #CAD s/p CABG; CHF, HTN, BPH:
   -On [**Month/Day (2) **], metoprolol, amlodipine; holding statin, ace-i, lasix, prazosin
   -Metroprolol increased to 100 TID today, amlodipine restarted [**9-20**]
   .
   # FEN:  Had eval by speech and swallow: Keep NPO w/ TFs, meds should be
   crushed for TF or IV. Hypernatremic today. Free water deficit
   calculated as 3.2 Liters. Goal decrease 0.5mEq/L/hr.
   -TFvia NG per nutrition recs.
   .
   # Glycemic control: good control currently
   .
   # Access: PICC line: repositioned
   .
   # PPx: sc heparin, ISS, bowel regimen
