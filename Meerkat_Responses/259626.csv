","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of anxiety and refusal of BPAP. The patient has a history of allergies to doxycycline, tetracycline, and augmentin, resulting in rashes. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium and ranitidine as prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate mild respiratory acidosis. The patient's lab results reveal slightly low white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's refusal of BPAP and the ABG results indicating mild respiratory acidosis suggest potential respiratory complications. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and ABG values closely and consider adjusting respiratory support if necessary.

2. Infection: The slightly low white blood cell count may indicate an infection. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and clinical symptoms is necessary to identify any signs of infection and initiate appropriate treatment if needed.

3. Fluid Imbalance: The negative fluid balance of -750 mL indicates that the patient is losing more fluids than they are receiving. This can lead"

   43-year-old woman with pulmonary hypertension s/p L pneumonectomy due
   to TB, also with history of OSA, presented with recurrent dyspnea.

   # SOB/pulmonary hypertension: a long standing history of hypoxemia (low
   80s on room air, per OMR) and newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension
   with TR gradient 50-70 and dilated RV. Unclear precipitant for this
   episode of hypercapnea; currently not hypoxemic. No clear evidence of
   pneumonia, ACS; recent CTA was negative for PE. Supposed to be on O2
   and BPAP at home; but compliance with either is questionable. ABG
   7.25/106/116/49; her baseline pCO2 is in the 70s.  Hypoxia persists
   with slightly greater than baseline oxygen requirement (currently on 4L
   compared to 2L at home)
   - continue BPAP at night
   - incentive spirometry
   - echo with bubble to evaluate for shunt
   - communicate with outpatient pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
   cardiologist regarding work up for pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia: HR in the 100s-110s. Asymptomatic.  Was also in
   sinus tach during last admission. TSH unremarkable last week. CTA
   negative on prior admission for PE. Appears euvolemic but can still be
   slightly dehydrated.  Question contribution of anxiety and albuterol to
   elevated heart rate.
   - no improvement with bolus of 500 cc NS

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female admitted with underlying restrictive chest wall physiology
   and pHTN, admitted w/ hypercarbic resp failure in the setting of BiPAP
   noncompliance.
   1. Acute on chronic hypercarbic resp failure- likely underlying
   hypoventilation exac by not getting BiPAP that she has been prescribed
   for OSA/hypooventi
   -tolerate BiPAP overnight w/ return of ABG to near baseline values
   -stable
   2. Hypoxemic resp failure- seemingly chronic as pt v comfortable w/ sig
   desaturations; multifact related to pHTN and hypoventilation
   -cont BiPAP, supp O2 to keep O2 sats 88-92
   -consider shunt processes; intracardiac given severe pHTN
   -would discuss pHTN workup and mgmt w/ outpt cardiologist and
   pulmonologist; check echo w/ bubble
   3. Tachycardia- stable per comparison to prior admisison and clinically
   euvolemic
   -recent TSH stable and therapeutic
   -minimize albuterol tx

   Hypoxia: Unclear the exact etiology but likely pulmonary hypertension
   as underlying etiology of progressive shortness of breath/hypoxia.  She
   had similar presentation about 1-2 weeks ago and CTA at that time was
   normal.  I think she warrants a right heart cath with testing for
   pulmonary htn and responsiveness.
   Plan:
   1)      ECHO with bubble study
   2)      Cardiology consult for right heart cath
   3)      Pulmonary Consult
   4)      Continue to wean oxygen as tolerated, bipap overnight

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female admitted with underlying restrictive chest wall physiology
   and pHTN, admitted w/ hypercarbic resp failure in the setting of BiPAP
   noncompliance.
   1. Acute on chronic hypercarbic resp failure- likely underlying
   hypoventilation exac by not getting BiPAP that she has been prescribed
   for OSA/hypooventi
   -tolerate BiPAP overnight w/ return of ABG to near baseline values
   -stable
   2. Hypoxemic resp failure- seemingly chronic as pt v comfortable w/ sig
   desaturations; multifact related to pHTN and hypoventilation
   -cont BiPAP, supp O2 to keep O2 sats 88-92
   -consider shunt processes; intracardiac given severe pHTN
   -would discuss pHTN workup and mgmt w/ outpt cardiologist and
   pulmonologist; check echo w/ bubble
   3. Tachycardia- stable per comparison to prior admisison and clinically
   euvolemic
   -recent TSH stable and therapeutic
   -minimize albuterol tx

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension, previous left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented with recurrent dyspnea and is currently experiencing hypoxia and hypercapnea. She is being treated in the ICU and is on BiPAP overnight. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate in the 100s-110s, but she remains asymptomatic. Other findings include absent breath sounds on the left base, rales on the right base, and normal S1 + S2 heart sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and platelets, as well as low hemoglobin, potassium, and magnesium levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progression of pulmonary hypertension: The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension and recent symptoms of dyspnea may indicate worsening of this condition. Close monitoring and consideration for right heart catheterization are recommended.
2. Ventilatory failure: The patient's hypercapnea and hypoxia suggest inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjustment of BiPAP settings are necessary.
3. Infection: The slightly elevated white blood cell count could indicate an underlying infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic treatment may be required.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has low potassium and magnesium levels, which can affect cardiac function and muscle"

 the underlying pulmonary

   confounding the issue as yesterday I had presumed worsening pulmonary
   hypertension.  Other etiologies, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy
   leading to pulmonary edema are plausible and were suggested by
   pulmonary.  A right heart cath will help identify the diagnosis.

   1)      Cardiology consult for right heart cath

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension and lung pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis. She presented with recurrent dyspnea and is currently in the ICU. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 98/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is comfortable on BIPAP and alert. The physical examination shows absent breath sounds on the left side, rales on the right base, tachycardia, normal heart sounds, and no other abnormalities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelets, as well as slightly low hemoglobin and potassium levels. The patient has a history of allergies to tetracycline and augmentin, as well as sinus tachycardia. She is receiving ranitidine for GERD prophylaxis and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis. The plan includes consulting cardiology for a right heart catheterization, continuing BIPAP overnight, and weaning oxygen as tolerated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation: Given the patient's history of pulmonary hypertension, there is a risk of worsening or further complications related to this condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and absent breath sounds on the left side may indicate a potential risk for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension, left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented with recurrent dyspnea. She is currently in the ICU and experiencing hypoxia, possibly related to her pulmonary hypertension. Her TR gradient on ECHO has improved, and there is no evidence of shunt. She is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and continues to have BIPAP overnight. She also has sinus tachycardia, which is not causing any symptoms, and a history of this condition dating back to 2017. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is being treated with ranitidine. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate in the range of 94-111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 67/57 mmHg to 120/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the nasal cannula. She has received a total of 1400 mL of fluids, with an output of 450 mL. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with slightly elevated creatinine, potassium, and bicarbonate levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

","The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the provided progress note. The 24-hour events include the patient being on 4L at home when she uses oxygen, a plan for right heart catheterization (RHC) on 2-15, avoiding right IJ for cath site as the patient only has a right lung, holding off on diuretics until after cath, NPO at midnight, and readdressing prophylactic anticoagulation given pulmonary hypertension prior to discharge. It is also mentioned that cardiology scheduled RHC but did not formally consult, and due to bed shortage and the patient's BiPAP requirements, the patient was not called out.

The patient has allergies to doxycycline, tetracycline, and augmentin (oral), with rashes and hives as reactions. The last dose of antibiotics was administered on 2-14. The patient is currently receiving ranitidine (prophylaxis) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension, post left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented with recurrent dyspnea.
- She has a long-standing history of hypoxemia and newly diagnosed pulmonary hypertension with a TR gradient of 50-70 and dilated RV. The cause of her current hypercapnea is unclear.
- She is not hypoxemic at the moment but requires slightly more oxygen than her baseline requirement.
- The patient is currently on BiPAP and nasal cannula oxygen.
- Her ABG results show pH 7.25, pCO2 106, HCO3- 49, and O2 saturation of 95%.
- Physical examination findings include tachycardia with a heart rate in the 100s-110s, and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
- She has no evidence of pneumonia or ACS, and her recent CTA was negative for PE.
- She is supposed to be on O2 and BPAP at home, but compliance is questionable.
- The plan includes continuing BPAP at night, incentive spirometry, an echo with bubble to evaluate for shunt, and communication with outpatient pulmonologist and cardiologist regarding workup for pulmonary hypertension.
- She also has a history of anxiety, which may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension, post left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented with recurrent dyspnea. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.25, pCO2 of 106, and pO2 of 116. She is currently on BiPAP and oxygen therapy. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate in the 100s-110s, blood pressure of 100/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius. Physical examination reveals no breath sounds on the left lung, good air movement on the right lung, occasional crackles on the right base, and a slightly anxious appearance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a potential risk of inadequate oxygenation of tissues and organs. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which can worsen over time and lead to right heart failure and other complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's reliance on BiPAP and high oxygen requirements suggest a possibility of respiratory failure if the current interventions are not effective.
4. Infection: The presence of diarrhea and an elevated white blood cell count may indicate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension and left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis. She presents with recurrent dyspnea and is currently experiencing anxiety, hypoxemia, and diarrhea. She is also known to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, with a heart rate in the 100s-110s, and her oxygen saturation is maintained above 92%. The physical examination reveals no breath sounds on the left side, minimal chest excursion on the left, and occasional crackles on the right base. There are no murmurs or other abnormal heart sounds. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, with slightly elevated levels of potassium, bicarbonate, and magnesium. Her liver enzymes are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygenation, which can be caused by pulmonary hypertension, restrictive pericardial disease, or other respiratory conditions. It is crucial to maintain oxygen delivery to keep SpO2 above 92%.

2. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently in the 100s-110s, indicating sinus tachycardia. This may be related to her history of sinus tachycardia or an underlying condition. Monitoring the heart rate and addressing any potential causes is essential.

   Plan:
   1)      Right heart cath today
   2)      Pulmonary Following
   3)      Continue oxygen, bipap at night
   4)      Can go to floor
   Addendum: Right heart cath reveals pulmonary hypertension with normal
   wedge pressure and no evidence of constrictive or restrictive
   physiology.  Pulmonary hypertension improves with oxygen therapy.
   Still unclear exactly what is driving her recent acute episodes and the
   ground glass opacities on CT though it is possible that she is taking
   off oxygen and having acute on chronic increases in pulmonary pressures
   that put her into distress.  Pulmonary service following and patient
   will go to the floor today

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension, post left pneumonectomy due to TB, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She presented with recurrent dyspnea and was admitted to the ICU.

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient uses oxygen when on 4L at home.
- There is a plan for a right heart catheterization (RHC) on [2-15].
- The patient's BiPAP settings are [7-3] with 1-6 L/min O2 for a goal SpO2 of 88-92%. She tolerated BIPAP overnight.
- The patient has allergies to doxycycline, tetracycline, and augmentin.
- She received ranitidine for prophylaxis and heparin sodium for prophylaxis as well.
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for hypoxemia.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 100/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals an alert and oriented patient with no acute distress. The patient has sclera anicteric, good dentition"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANXIETY
 HYPOXEMIA
 DIARRHEA
","The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, as indicated by the use of supplemental oxygen and BiPAP settings of [**7-3**] with 1-6 L O2 for a goal SpO2 of 88-92%. Additionally, the patient has anxiety, which is a common psychological response to being in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal limits, but with low blood pressure (100/63 mmHg) and slightly elevated respiratory rate (21 insp/min). The temperature is slightly below normal, with a current temperature of 35.6°C (96°F) and a maximum temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F) recorded.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an IV fluid balance of -1,100 mL, indicating significant fluid loss. Blood products have been transfused, totaling 1,650 mL out, while urine output is also low at 1,650 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 95%. The most recent ABG results show a pH of ///49/, indicating acidosis.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 4.9 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 36.2%, and thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of [**Please specify value**]. Renal function tests reveal impaired creatinine clearance with a Cr of 0.6, and abnormal liver enzymes (ALT/AST:27/33, Alk Phos/T Bili:56/0.3). Other lab results include hypoalbuminemia (Albumin:4.0 g/dL), elevated LDH (LDH:180 IU/L), normal calcium and magnesium levels, and normal phosphate levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals no additional findings. The assessment and plan include managing anxiety, addressing hypoxemia, and treating diarrhea.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration in renal function, worsening respiratory distress, development of infections due to immunosuppression, and complications related to the patient's underlying comorbidities. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is essential in managing the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension, post left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented with recurrent dyspnea and is currently in the ICU. She has been on BiPAP and oxygen via nasal cannula as needed to maintain SpO2 above 92%. The patient has a history of sinus tachycardia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Her current vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate in the 100s-110s, blood pressure ranging from 96/58 to 101/150 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and temperature within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be related to pulmonary hypertension, but it is unclear if the condition has progressed. Other possibilities such as restrictive pericardial disease should also be considered. A right heart catheterization has been planned to further evaluate this.
2. Pulmonary Edema and Effusions: The patient's presentation includes pulmonary edema and effusions. These symptoms could indicate worsening of pulmonary hypertension or other cardiac conditions like pericardial disease.
3. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently in the 100s-110s, which is above the normal range. This may be due to her history of sinus tach"

   Assessment and Plan
   43-year-old woman with pulmonary hypertension s/p L pneumonectomy due
   to TB, also with history of OSA, presented with recurrent dyspnea.
   # Hypoxia/Hypercarbia: Likely related to pulmonary hypertension though
   unclear if this condition has progressed. Also unclear as pHTN would
   not explain pulmonary edema and effusions.  Echo w/o shunting.
   Restrictive pericardial disease ruled out from catheterization and
   imaging.  Pulmonary pressures did not suggest current CHF
   exacerbation.  Consider increased somnolence this morning  possibly due
   to increased oxygenation with sildenifil and decreased respiratory
   drive.
   -- decrease supplemental oxygenation to 2L  NC as needed to keep sats
   >92%
   -- continue sildenifil tid
   --cont BIPAP overnight setting [**7-3**] with 1-6 L/min O2 for goal SpO2
   88-92%
   --counseled extensively on need for compliance of BiPAP at home
   --will readdress indication for anticoagulation given pHTN
will likely
   defer given concern for compliance. Will let outpt pulmonologist f/u
   this issue
   --started ativan 0.5 mg qhs for BiPAP induced anxiety

   [**Name (NI) 1163**] pt has history of sinus tachycardia dating back to [**2170**].
   # AVNRT: Symptomatic with decreased blood pressure and lightheadedness.
   Resolved with valsalva.   Start metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] given symptoms.

   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan as above with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   Overnight, started on sidenafil and tolerated but now unresponsive
   97.5     P:  104   BP: 96/58   RR 16 Oxygen Saturation:  100%  on 4
   liters (baseline oxygen)
   General: Unresponsive
   Chest: No breath sounds on the left.  Clear on right
   Heart: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: Soft NT ND
   Ext: No edema
   Labs: reviewed and as above
   Assessment:
   1)      Unresponsiveness
   2)      Pulmonary Hypertension
   3)      Tachyarrythmia (AVNRT)
   4)      GERD
   Plan:
   1)      Check ABG to evaluate pCO2 given significant somnolence
   2)      Decrease oxygen for moment as I suspect that the sidenafil has
   improved oxygenation leading to oxygen causing pCO2 retention
   3)      Continue bipap at night
   Addendum: Very hypercarbic likely as result of improved oxygenation
   leading to some hypercarbia when saturing at 100% throughout the night
   likely because of improved status from sidenafil.  Hypercarbia improved
   with brief NIV (not tolerated) plus decreased oxygen provision.
   Time Spent:  30 minutes, pt critically ill

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension, post left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented with recurrent dyspnea. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxia/hypercarbia, sinus tachycardia, AVNRT, and GERD. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation: Given the patient's history and symptoms, there is a risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to further respiratory distress and decreased oxygenation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of unresponsiveness and high carbon dioxide levels suggests the possibility of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and respiratory support may be necessary.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of sinus tachycardia and AVNRT indicates a potential risk for future cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring and appropriate medication adjustment may be required.
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) complications: Uncontrolled GERD can lead to aspiration pneumonia or worsening respiratory symptoms. Continuing ranitidine and considering additional interventions for GERD management is essential.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE): Due to the patient's immobilization in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots. Regular assessment and consideration of anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension, post left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented with recurrent dyspnea. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 108/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently on BIPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure) and has shown improvement in her gas exchange.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension as indicated by right heart catheterization. This condition can lead to right ventricular failure and potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary edema or arrhythmias.
2. Hypercarbia: The patient has high levels of carbon dioxide (pCO2), which can be caused by hypoventilation or respiratory muscle weakness. If left unaddressed, it may lead to respiratory acidosis and further deterioration in oxygenation.
3. Hypoxia: Although the patient's current oxygen saturation is within normal limits, her history of OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and pulmonary hypertension puts her at risk for episodes of low oxygen levels. Hypoxia can result in tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
4. GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease):"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension and previous left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis. She also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea and presented with recurrent dyspnea. The patient experienced hypercarbia/hypoxia, with pCO2 levels as high as 132 yesterday, but improved with the initiation of BIPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure). The patient's baseline pCO2 level is likely around 100.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's high pCO2 levels indicate respiratory failure, which is a serious condition that requires immediate attention. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status is crucial.
2. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation: The patient has a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, which can worsen if not properly managed. It is important to continue the use of sildenafil to help manage the pulmonary hypertension.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of the patient's respiratory status and proper hygiene practices should be implemented to minimize the risk.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures, such as low molecular weight heparin, should be continued to prevent the development of DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient may be at an increased risk of stress ulcer due to her ICU stay. Prophylactic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary hypertension, post left pneumonectomy due to tuberculosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presented with recurrent dyspnea. The patient experienced episodes of hypercarbia/hypoxia, with a peak pCO2 level of 132 yesterday. She was started on BIPAP, which improved her gas exchange to 7.31/115/91/48. The patient is currently on BIPAP both at nighttime and during sleep.

The patient also has severe pulmonary hypertension, as confirmed by right heart catheterization. Her sildenafil dosage has been increased to 40 mg three times a day. She is advised to continue using BIPAP at home and to be compliant with it.

The patient had an episode of sinus tachycardia but no further episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). A cardiologist consultation is planned for further management of AVNRT.

The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for which she is being continued on ranitidine.

The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating between 3.9 and 4.9 thousand cells/microliter. Her hemoglobin level is slightly low at 10.4 g/dL. Platelet count is within normal range. Renal function tests show a creatinine level of 0"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of post-TB pneumonectomy, complicated by pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia. She presented with recurrent respiratory failure and hypercarbia but has improved with supplemental oxygen and autodiuresis. The patient is awake, alert, and interactive, with decreased breath sounds on the left side. Her vital signs are stable, and she is tolerating sildenafil and bipap at night. The plan is for her to be discharged to rehab today. She will have follow-up with Dr. [Last Name (Title)] for treatment of pulmonary hypertension. No indication for diuretic use at this time, but it will be considered as an outpatient.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure, which may continue if adequate respiratory support is not maintained during her transfer to rehab.
2. Hypercarbia: The patient's condition of hypercarbia needs to be closely monitored and managed, as it can lead to respiratory acidosis and other complications if not appropriately addressed.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's underlying pulmonary hypertension requires ongoing management and treatment, and it needs to be considered during her transition to outpatient care.
4. Potential infection: Although not explicitly mentioned in the progress note, the patient's history of TB pneumonectomy increases the risk of developing infections, which should be monitored closely"
