","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, dementia, depression, and anxiety. She was admitted to the ICU after falling and presenting with a C2 fracture and bilateral pulmonary emboli. She is not a surgical candidate for her cervical spine fracture, and it is recommended to wear a cervical collar for 6 weeks. The patient has been treated with heparin for bilateral PE, and her leukocytosis is improving with empiric CDiff treatment. She has oliguria, likely due to volume depletion, and renal function is otherwise intact. She continues to receive treatment for her diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, and depression. The patient's electrolytes should be monitored regularly, and she is encouraged to have a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids. Systemic heparin is being administered as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and her disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has bibasilar atelectasis versus aspiration, which could lead to pneumonia if not managed properly.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is receiving systemic heparin as prophylaxis, there is still a risk of developing DVT due to immobilization.
3. Pressure Ulcers"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is an 87 yo woman with h/o
   osteoporosis, DM2, dementia, depression, and anxiety who presents s/p
   fall with evidence of C2 fracture and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
   .
   # PE:  CTA of the patient's neck showed evidence of right and left
   pulmonary artery emboli.  Per radiology, the PE straddles the
   bifurcation but it is not occlusive.  She is currently hemodynamically
   stable and is satting 99% on 2L NC.  Given the patient's recent C2
   fracture, there is a much larger risk in starting anticoagulation in
   this patient.  Per conversation with the patient's family, they are
   interested in proceeding with anticoagulation.
    - Start heparin gtt
    - Monitor respiratory status and PTT q6h
    - Investigate possible malignant causes of coagulopathy (up-to-date
   colonoscopy, mammogram?)
    - Hold Lasix, Enalapril, and Metoprolol in the setting of acute PE
   .
   # C2 Fracture:  The patient has a transverse comminuted fracture of
   C2.  She is not a surgical candidate, and surgery recommended a
   cervical collar for 6 weeks.
    - F/U surgery recs
    - Continue cervical collar
    - Neuro checks q2h to evaluate for cord compression
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  The patient has a leukocytosis to 30K on this
   admission.  She recently had a CDiff infection, for which she underwent
   Flagyl therapy for 7 days.  DDx includes sepsis v. CDiff v. leukemia.
    - Start Flagyl 500 mg PO TID
    - Continue to monitor WBC daily
   .
   # DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which she takes Lantus
   daily and Novalog insulin SS.  Her SSI does not start until FSBG of
   300, as the patient reportedly has very brittle DM2.
    - Continue home SSI and Lantus
    - FSBG qid
   .
   # CAD s/p MI: Continue ASA and Zocor.  Hold Enalapril, Metoprolol, and
   Lasix today
   .
   # Depression:  Continue Wellbutrin and Citalopram

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, dementia, depression, and anxiety. She presents after falling and has evidence of a C2 fracture and bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and is oxygenating well on a nasal cannula. Due to the patient's recent C2 fracture, there is a larger risk in starting anticoagulation. The patient's family is interested in proceeding with anticoagulation. Heparin infusion has been started, and the patient's respiratory status and PTT will be monitored every six hours. Possible malignant causes of coagulopathy will also be investigated, including an up-to-date colonoscopy and mammogram. Medications such as Lasix, Enalapril, and Metoprolol have been held in the setting of acute PE.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C2 Fracture: The patient has a transverse comminuted fracture of C2. She is not a surgical candidate, and surgery recommends a cervical collar for six weeks. Potential complications may include non-union, malunion, or further neurological deficits due to cord compression.

2. Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has evidence of bilateral pulmonary artery emboli. Potential complications may include further deterioration in oxygenation, development of hypotension, tachycardia, or even sudden cardiac arrest. Anticoagulation therapy will be initiated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis, DM2, dementia, depression, and anxiety.
- She presents with a C2 fracture and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
- The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and is oxygenating well.
- The family has expressed interest in proceeding with anticoagulation despite the risk associated with the recent C2 fracture.
- The patient has a transverse comminuted fracture of C2 and is not a surgical candidate.
- She has a leukocytosis of 30K on admission, possibly due to a recent Clostridium difficile (CDiff) infection.
- The patient also has a history of DM2 and CAD with previous myocardial infarction.
- She is on multiple medications including insulin, aspirin, and statin therapy.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/43 to 146/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anticoagulation in the presence of a recent C2 fracture may increase the risk of spinal cord injury or hemorrhage.
2. The patient's leukocytosis could be indicative of an ongoing infection, possibly sepsis or recurrence of CDiff infection.
3. The patient's history of DM2 and CAD puts her at risk for complications such as hypoglycemia or further cardiac events.
4. The patient's dementia and depression may complicate her recovery and management.
5. The patient's current tachycardia and fever could be signs of an underlying infection or other physiological stressors.
6. The patient's use of multiple medications requires careful monitoring for potential drug interactions or side effects."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is an 87 yo woman with h/o
   osteoporosis, DM2, dementia, depression, and anxiety who presents s/p
   fall with evidence of C2 fracture and bilateral pulmonary emboli.
   # PE:  CTA of the patient's neck showed evidence of right and left
   pulmonary artery emboli.  Per radiology, the PE straddles the
   bifurcation but it is not occlusive.  She is currently hemodynamically
   stable and is satting 99% on 2L NC.  Given the patient's recent C2
   fracture, there is a much larger risk in starting anticoagulation in
   this patient.  Per conversation with the patient's family, they are
   interested in proceeding with anticoagulation.
    - heparin gtt
    - Monitor respiratory status and PTT q6h
    - Investigate possible malignant causes of coagulopathy (up-to-date
   colonoscopy, mammogram?)
    - Hold Lasix, Enalapril, and Metoprolol in the setting of acute PE
   .
   # C2 Fracture:  The patient has a transverse comminuted fracture of
   C2.  She is not a surgical candidate, and surgery recommended a
   cervical collar for 6 weeks.
    - F/U surgery recs
    - Continue cervical collar
    - Neuro checks q2h to evaluate for cord compression
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  The patient has a leukocytosis to 30K on this
   admission.  She recently had a CDiff infection, for which she underwent
   Flagyl therapy for 7 days.  DDx includes sepsis v. CDiff v. leukemia.
    - Start Flagyl 500 mg PO TID
    - Continue to monitor WBC daily
   .
   # DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, for which she takes Lantus
   daily and Novalog insulin SS.  Her SSI does not start until FSBG of
   300, as the patient reportedly has very brittle DM2.
    - Continue home SSI and Lantus
    - FSBG qid

She is currently hemodynamically stable and is maintaining an oxygen saturation of 99% on 2 liters nasal cannula. Due to the patient's recent C2 fracture, there is a larger risk in starting anticoagulation. However, the patient's family is interested in proceeding with anticoagulation.

The patient has a transverse comminuted fracture of C2 and is not a surgical candidate. Surgery has recommended a cervical collar for 6 weeks. The patient will need to have neuro checks every 2 hours to evaluate for cord compression.

The patient also has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 30K on this admission. She recently had a CDiff infection for which she underwent Flagyl therapy for 7 days. Differential diagnoses include sepsis, CDiff infection, and leukemia. She will need to continue taking Flagyl 500 mg PO TID and have her WBC monitored daily.

The patient has a history of DM2 and takes Lantus daily and Novolog insulin SS. Her SSI does not start until FSBG of 300 as the patient reportedly has very brittle DM2. She will need to continue her home SSI and Lantus and have FSBG monitored every 4 hours.

The patient has a history of CAD post-myocardial infarction and will need to continue taking ASA and Zocor. Medications such as Enalapril, Metoprolol, and Lasix will be held today.

The patient is also being treated for depression with Wellbutrin and Citalopram.

In terms of ICU care, the patient will receive regular, pureed food with nectar thick liquids. Glycemic control will be monitored using HISS. The patient has a 20-gauge line inserted on [date]. Prophylaxis for DVT will be given through systemic anticoagulation with heparin. Stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP precautions will also be implemented. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and will be admitted to the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis, DM2, dementia, depression, and anxiety. She presents after a fall with evidence of a C2 fracture and bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including macrocytic anemia, leukocytosis with Clostridium difficile infection, oliguria, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, and depression. She is not a surgical candidate for the cervical spine fracture and is recommended to wear a cervical collar for six weeks. The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: Due to the presence of bilateral pulmonary emboli, there is a risk of a pneumothorax developing, which can compromise the patient's respiratory function.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of right superficial femoral vein thrombosis seen on lower extremity venous Doppler. This indicates an increased risk for developing DVT, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome.
3. Cervical spine fracture complications: The patient has a C2 fracture, and wearing a cervical collar for six weeks is recommended. However, there is a risk of nonunion, mal"

   The patient is an 87 yo woman with h/o osteoporosis, DM2, dementia,
   depression, and anxiety who presents s/p fall with evidence of C2
   fracture and bilateral pulmonary emboli.

   - monitor
   # C2 fx: Also notable are T4-T7 transverse process fx.  She is not a
   surgical candidate, and surgery recommended a cervical collar for 6
   weeks.
   - Neuro checks q4h to evaluate for cord compression
   # Macrocytic anemia: concern for bleeding given heparin ggt
   - monitor hct
   - active t/s
   # Leukocytosis: C Diff+,  improving
   - Flagyl  vancomycin po
   # Oliguria: Likely volume depleted. Renal function otherwise intact.
   - Continue gentle IVF boluses
   # DM2:  Her SSI does not start until FSBG of 300, as the patient
   reportedly has very brittle DM2.
    - Continue home SSI and Lantus
   # CAD s/p MI: Continue ASA and Zocor

","The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, dementia, depression, and anxiety. She presents after a fall with evidence of a C2 fracture and bilateral pulmonary emboli. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and fever. 

The patient's lab results indicate macrocytic anemia, leukocytosis with Clostridium difficile infection, oliguria likely due to volume depletion, and intact renal function. Her diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with home subcutaneous insulin and Lantus. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease after a myocardial infarction and is on aspirin and Zocor. She is also being treated for depression with Wellbutrin and Citalopram.

The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is pending clinical improvement in the ICU. The patient's physical examination reveals cervical tenderness, tachycardia, normal breath sounds, and no lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows minimal responsiveness and demented behavior.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory compromise due to bilateral pulmonary emboli, worsening of macrocytic anemia leading to bleeding, progression of leukocytosis with C. difficile infection, and possible worsening of the patient's renal function due to volume depletion. Additionally, the patient's diabetes mellitus type "

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a chief complaint of PE and C2 fracture after a mechanical fall. She is non-operative for the C2 fracture and has been found to have a large PE. She is currently on anticoagulation therapy and has been positive for Clostridium difficile (c.diff) infection, but has shown improvement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 101 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 102/41 mmHg to 146/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination shows no significant abnormalities except for diminished breath sounds throughout the chest and right lower extremity edema. She is unable to stand due to a musculoskeletal issue.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and troponin T levels. Blood glucose levels are fluctuating, with readings of 94 mg/dL, 259 mg/dL, and 145 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated creatinine, potassium, and calcium levels, as well as decreased magnesium and phosphate levels.

Imaging reveals resolved chest edema.

The patient has multiple medical complications including olig"
