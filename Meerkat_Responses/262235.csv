   Disposition:
","The patient in the ICU is experiencing hypoxia, which refers to a decreased amount of oxygen reaching the tissues. This can be indicated by a low SpO2 level of 94%. The patient also has tachycardia, characterized by a heart rate between 130s-140s bpm, and hypotension with blood pressure readings in the 70s. Additionally, the patient experienced paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with retrograde p waves, but was successfully converted back to sinus rhythm after a carotid massage.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's low SpO2 level suggests inadequate oxygenation, which may lead to respiratory distress and further deterioration in oxygenation.

2. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of SVT indicates a risk for recurrent arrhythmias, which could compromise cardiac output and lead to hemodynamic instability.

3. Infection: The presence of fever (Tmax: 38.3 C) and elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 11.0 K/uL) raises the possibility of an ongoing infection, potentially contributing to the patient's overall condition.

4. Fluid imbalance: The negative fluid balance (total in - total out: -2,725 mL) suggests ongoing fluid losses, which can impact the patient's hemodynamic status and renal function.

5. Kidney dysfunction: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who was admitted for klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, hyperlipidemia, and is on medications for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. His recent vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/60 mmHg to 78/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's physical examination reveals reduced edema, crackles in the right lung, and soft abdomen. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated creatinine levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows multifocal patchy areas of opacity in the right upper and both lower lobes, which could reflect multifocal pneumonia and interstitial edema, possibly indicating a chronic underlying interstitial process. The patient has several medical complications including hypoxemia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, UTI caused by klebsiella and enterococci, sinus tachycardia, metastatic prostate cancer, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), hyperlipidemia, and stage IV chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to desaturate with movement, indicating persistent low oxygen levels in the blood.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray suggests the presence of pneumonia acquired during his hospital stay.
3. UTI: The patient has a UTI caused by klebsiella and enterococci, which is a risk due to his chronic indwelling Foley catheter.
4. Sinus tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and is likely experiencing sinus tachycardia due to hypoxia, infections, and malignancy.
5. Metastatic prostate cancer: The patient has metastatic prostate cancer that requires outpatient follow-up.
6. ITP: The patient has a normal platelet count despite ITP, so monitoring is necessary.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia should be managed with continued statin therapy.
8. Stage IV Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure should be managed by avoiding nephrotoxins and dosing medications appropriately.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is recommended for accurate assessments and management of the patient's condition."

 HYPOXEMIA
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 **]yo male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted
   for klebsiella/enterococcus UTI and pna, who is transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Currently satting 100% on NRB.
   Likely secondary to infection and volume overload.  Pt was admitted
   with pneumonia, felt to be in the retrocardiac space, then later found
   to have a new infiltrate in the right lobe.  In the setting of
   hypotension and tachycardia he has been receiving ivfs, and his exam
   and CXR is now consistent with volume overload.  Unlikely to be PE
   given he is on HSQ and CXR shows a more likely etiology of pulmonary
   edema.
   - cont. NRB, can try NIPPV
   - IV Lasix 10 mg x1, goal of I&O -500cc or greater as tolerated by BP
   in next 24 hours
   - Nitro gtt if tolerated by BP
   - ECHO is AM as no history of CHF
   - Repeat ABG
   - Broaden pneumonia coverage to HAP with cefepime/levo/vanc
   - Send sputum culture, follow up urine legionella, follow blood
   cultures
   - cont. nebs
   .
   # Hypotension:  Currently pt is not hypotensive.  This was initially
   thought to be due to hypovolemia; however, sepsis is a likely
   contributing to her hypotension at this time.  There is no ECHO here.
   Pt denies any chest pain.  STD on EKG is likely rate-related.  Pt is
   also currently on prednisone for ITP, so there is concern for adrenal
   insufficiency though the patient has been on relatively low dose
   steroids for only a few weeks.
   - Hold on further IVFs at this time
   - Cont. abx as above
   - serial CEs, EKGs
   - ECHO in AM
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim in AM
   .
   # Hospital-acquired pneumonia:  Pt was admitted with pneumonia, felt to
   be in the retrocardiac space, then later found to have a new infiltrate
   in the right lobe, which would quality as HAP .
   - Broaden pneumonia coverage to HAP with cefepime/levo/vanc
   - Send sputum culture, follow up urine legionella, follow blood
   cultures
   .
   # UTI:  Klebsiella and enterococci in cultures.  At risk due to chronic
   indwelling Foley.
   - will be covered by cefepime/levo/vanc
   .
   # Sinus tachycardia:  Likely due to hypoxia, infections, ?hypovolemia.
   - monitor rate
   .
   # Metastatic prostate cancer:
   - continue outpatient follow-up
   - continue prednisone 5mg daily for pain, dose has been tapered and
   would have been discontinued on Friday [**2-12**]
   .
   # ITP:  Plt count normal.
   - cont. to monitor plts
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin
   .
   # Stage IV Chronic Renal Failure: Stable
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # FEN: NPO until respiratory status stabilizes, replete electrolytes
   prn, I&O goal of -500
   # PPx: heparin SC, bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), with blood pressures in the 70s. These episodes were resolved without intervention. The patient was given additional Lasix, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1.1 liters as of 2300. The patient then experienced SVT again, with blood pressures in the 50s, which were resolved with carotid massage. Metoprolol was started at a dose of 12.5 mg every 6 hours, and the patient received a total of 5 IV for SVT again.

The patient's allergies include Percodan (Oral) (Oxycodone Hcl/Aspirin) and Lipitor (Oral) (Atorvastatin Calcium), with unknown allergies. The patient received antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Cefepime.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), a heart rate of 90 bpm (88-130), a blood pressure of 115/59 mmHg (72), a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (17-27), and an oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nebulizer. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], including the assessment and plan. I
   would emphasize and add the following points: [**Age over 90 **]M met prostate cancer
   c/b enterococcal / klebs UTI admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory distress
   - improved with diuresis. AVNRT yesterday, broke to NSR c carotid
   massage.
   Exam notable for Tm 100.9 BP 105/53 HR 103 RR with sat 99 on 50% FM.
   JVD 7cm. Coarse BS B rales to [**1-10**]. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS, 2+ edema. Labs
   notable for WBC 9K, HCT 27, K+ 4.3, Cr 1.7. CXR with resolving CHF.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with ongoing diuresis,
   oxygen wean, elevation of HOB. Will check echo and continue abx for
   both UTI and possible nosocomial pneumonia - vanco / cefepime via PIV.
   CRI is at baseline. Episodic hypotension likely from autonomic
   dysregulation, has not responded to IVF. AVNRT - responds to carotid
   massage. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Combination of likely
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis and shunting from PFO. No improvement to
   very slight improvement. Patient still desats with even minimal
   movement, still with crackles on exam.  CT showing diffuse ground glass
   bl opacities, ddx in order of likelihood hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   interstitial infectious pneumonia, pulmonary edema (less likely as not
   favoring to dependent areas), less likely IPF and least likely
   metatstatic prostate lymphangitic spread (prostate rarely metastasizes
   to anything other than bone). Pt seems euvolemic therefore will hold on
   diuresis.
   - DC cefepime and vancomycin as pt has received 8 days of antibiotics
   for CAP (see below for course).
   - Repeat sputum cx
   - F/u blood cultures
   .
   # Possible Community-acquired pneumonia:  Although more likely cause of
   cough and hypoxia is this ground glass opacity (no infiltrate on CT
   chest). Treatment complete s/p 8 days of abx. Pt admitted on [**2117-2-13**] and
   started on Levofloxacin 750mg IV Q48H and discontinued on [**2117-2-15**].
   Patient started on vancomycin 1gm IV Q12H on [**2117-2-13**]. Pt started on
   cefepime 1gm IV Q24H on [**2117-2-14**].
   - DC cefepime/vanc as pt has finished 8 days of abx covering her CAP
   .
   # Complicated UTI:  Klebsiella and enterococci in cultures.  At risk
   due to chronic indwelling Foley.
   - Start Unasyn as this covers both klebsiella and enterococcus for a
   total 14 day course (day 1 was [**2117-2-14**]) for his complicated UTI.
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Last night episode of AVNRT, however improved after
   initiation of betablocker.  Currently NSR. Of note, his hypotensive
   episodes have ceased as his AVNRT has come undercontrol suggesting a
   cardiogenic and rate influenced hypotension, therefore pt was unlikely
   in urosepsis as previously thought.
   -Continue metoprolol 12.5mg PO Q6H and consider uptitrating if pt
   develops more AVNRT
   .
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: Outpatient follow-up
   .
   # ITP:  Plt count normal.
   - cont. to monitor plts
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin
   .
   # Stage IV Chronic Renal Failure: Stable
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medications

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia.
- The patient has been transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), urinary tract infection, hypotension, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure, and hypoxemia.
- The patient's respiratory failure is a combination of likely hypersensitivity pneumonitis and shunting from patent foramen ovale (PFO).
- The patient's current medications include heparin for DVT prophylaxis, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and metoprolol for SVT.
- The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal platelet count.
- The patient's imaging shows diffuse ground glass opacities on the chest CT, suggestive of pulmonary edema, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, infectious etiology, and less likely interstitial lung disease.
- The patient's urinary tract infection is caused by klebsiella and enterococci, which is likely due to a chronic indwelling Foley catheter.
- The patient's tachycardia is attributed to AVNRT episodes, but has improved with the"

   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Combination of likely
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis and shunting from PFO. No improvement to
   very slight improvement. Patient still desats with even minimal
   movement, still with crackles on exam.  CT showing diffuse ground glass
   bl opacities, ddx in order of likelihood hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   interstitial infectious pneumonia, pulmonary edema (less likely as not
   favoring to dependent areas), less likely IPF and least likely
   metatstatic prostate lymphangitic spread (prostate rarely metastasizes
   to anything other than bone). Pt seems euvolemic therefore will hold on
   diuresis.
   - DC cefepime and vancomycin as pt has received 8 days of antibiotics
   for CAP (see below for course).
   - Repeat sputum cx
   - F/u blood cultures
   .
   # Possible Community-acquired pneumonia:  Although more likely cause of
   cough and hypoxia is this ground glass opacity (no infiltrate on CT
   chest). Treatment complete s/p 8 days of abx. Pt admitted on [**2117-2-13**] and
   started on Levofloxacin 750mg IV Q48H and discontinued on [**2117-2-15**].
   Patient started on vancomycin 1gm IV Q12H on [**2117-2-13**]. Pt started on
   cefepime 1gm IV Q24H on [**2117-2-14**].
   - DC cefepime/vanc as pt has finished 8 days of abx covering her CAP
   .
   # Complicated UTI:  Klebsiella and enterococci in cultures.  At risk
   due to chronic indwelling Foley.
   - Start Unasyn as this covers both klebsiella and enterococcus for a
   total 14 day course (day 1 was [**2117-2-14**]) for his complicated UTI.
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Last night episode of AVNRT, however improved after
   initiation of betablocker.  Currently NSR. Of note, his hypotensive
   episodes have ceased as his AVNRT has come undercontrol suggesting a
   cardiogenic and rate influenced hypotension, therefore pt was unlikely
   in urosepsis as previously thought.
   -Continue metoprolol 12.5mg PO Q6H and consider uptitrating if pt
   develops more AVNRT
   .
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: Outpatient follow-up

   # ITP:  Plt count normal.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: [**Age over 90 **]M met prostate cancer c/b enterococcal /
   klebs UTI admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory distress - improved with
   diuresis. Several episodes of AVNRT c/b hypotension, broke to NSR c
   carotid massage, started on metoprolol.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.7 BP 115/53 HR 86 RR with sat 99 on 50% FM. JVD
   7cm. Coarse BS B crackles to [**1-10**] B, unchanged. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS, 2+
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 9K, HCT 27, K+ 4.3, Cr 1.9. CXR with
   resolving CHF.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with oxygen, elevation
   of HOB, supportive care - he had subtle subpleural changes in [**2115**] -
   will repeat HRCT chest today to see if this has progressed. Will check
   echo c bubbles to assess RV function and r/o shunt, and continue abx
   for both UTI and possible nosocomial pneumonia - vanco / cefepime via
   PIV. CRI is at baseline but precludes I+ CT, will check LENIs and start
   heparin without bolus, both for possible PE and to treat in-situ
   thrombosis if he has accelerated IPF. Continue metoprolol for AVNRT,
   which responds to carotid massage. Will meet with family at 1500 today,
   hopefully after review of CT scan. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is worsening. Treatment with cefepime will be continued, and consideration will be given to broadening the antibiotic coverage to Zosyn.

2. UTI: The patient has a Klebsiella and enterococci infection in his cultures. Treatment will be initiated with cefepime for a 14-day course, and the possibility of switching to oral medications later on will be considered.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to a combination of likely hypersensitivity pneumonitis and shunting from a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient still desaturates with minimal movement and has crackles on examination. A CT scan shows diffuse ground glass opacities, and the differential diagnosis includes hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial infectious pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and least likely interstitial lung disease. Diuretics have been withheld as the patient appears euvolemic.

4. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient had an episode of AVNRT last night, but improved after"

   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  No improvement. Patient still desats
   with even minimal movement, still with crackles on exam.  Would benefit
   from further diuresis.  Will continue to treat for HAP, however, pt has
   not improved at all despite 4L of diuresis and several days of broad

   noted in [**2115**]. Family asking if we need a goals of care meeting as pt
   not doing well.
   - IV Lasix 10 mg x1, goal of I&O -1L as tolerated by BP
   - ECHO today, will call echo lab as had been ordered since [**2117-2-14**].

   .
   # Sinus tachycardia:  Last night episode of AVNRT, however improved
   after initiation of betablocker.  Currently sinus tachy likely due to
   hypoxia, infections, malignancy. And AVNRT also likely triggered by
   hypoxia and infections.
   -Continue metoprolol 12.5mg PO Q6H and consider uptitrating if pt
   develops more AVNRT

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: [**Age over 90 **]M met prostate cancer c/b enterococcal /
   klebs UTI admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory distress - improved with
   diuresis. Several episodes of AVNRT c/b hypotension, broke to NSR c
   carotid massage, started on metoprolol.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.7 BP 115/53 HR 86 RR with sat 99 on 50% FM. JVD
   7cm. Coarse BS B crackles to [**1-10**] B, unchanged. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS, 2+
   edema. Labs notable for WBC 9K, HCT 27, K+ 4.3, Cr 1.9. CXR with
   resolving CHF.
   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with oxygen, elevation
   of HOB, supportive care - he had subtle subpleural changes in [**2115**] -
   will repeat HRCT chest today to see if this has progressed. Will check
   echo c bubbles to assess RV function and r/o shunt, and continue abx
   for both UTI and possible nosocomial pneumonia - vanco / cefepime via
   PIV. CRI is at baseline but precludes I+ CT, will check LENIs and start
   heparin without bolus, both for possible PE and to treat in-situ
   thrombosis if he has accelerated IPF. Continue metoprolol for AVNRT,
   which responds to carotid massage. Will meet with family at 1500 today,
   hopefully after review of CT scan. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who was admitted for a klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. He has been transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has not improved despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and diuretics. There are concerns about worsening chronic parenchymal lung disease. The patient's medical history includes hyperlipidemia, stage IV chronic renal failure, and ITP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have low oxygen levels despite treatment, indicating a potential complication of respiratory failure.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient's pneumonia is worsening, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired infection.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused by klebsiella and enterococci, which may lead to complications if not properly treated.
4. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient has had episodes of SVT, which can be triggered by hypoxia and infections.
5. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure has worsened, leading to acute diastolic heart failure on top of chronic heart failure.
6. Metastatic Prostate Cancer: The patient's underlying metastatic prostate cancer may contribute to his overall poor prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 **]yo male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted
   for klebsiella/enterococcus UTI and pna, who is transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:  Combination of likely
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis and shunting from PFO. No improvement to
   very slight improvement. Patient still desats with even minimal
   movement, still with crackles on exam.  CT showing diffuse ground glass
   bl opacities, ddx in order of likelihood hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   interstitial infectious pneumonia, pulmonary edema (less likely as not
   favoring to dependent areas), less likely IPF and least likely
   metatstatic prostate lymphangitic spread (prostate rarely metastasizes
   to anything other than bone). Pt seems euvolemic therefore will hold on
   diuresis.
   - DC cefepime and vancomycin as pt has received 8 days of antibiotics
   for CAP (see below for course).
   - Repeat sputum cx
   - F/u blood cultures
   .
   # Possible Community-acquired pneumonia:  Although more likely cause of
   cough and hypoxia is this ground glass opacity (no infiltrate on CT
   chest). Treatment complete s/p 8 days of abx. Pt admitted on [**2117-2-13**] and
   started on Levofloxacin 750mg IV Q48H and discontinued on [**2117-2-15**].
   Patient started on vancomycin 1gm IV Q12H on [**2117-2-13**]. Pt started on
   cefepime 1gm IV Q24H on [**2117-2-14**].
   - DC cefepime/vanc as pt has finished 8 days of abx covering her CAP
   .
   # Complicated UTI:  Klebsiella and enterococci in cultures.  At risk
   due to chronic indwelling Foley.
   - Start Unasyn as this covers both klebsiella and enterococcus for a
   total 14 day course (day 1 was [**2117-2-14**]) for his complicated UTI.
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Last night episode of AVNRT, however improved after
   initiation of betablocker.  Currently NSR. Of note, his hypotensive
   episodes have ceased as his AVNRT has come undercontrol suggesting a
   cardiogenic and rate influenced hypotension, therefore pt was unlikely

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for a klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely hospital-acquired, and respiratory failure that is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has a urinary tract infection, hypotension, tachycardia, heart failure (chronic), and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia has shown improvement but is still equivocal. There are concerns about hypersensitivity pneumonitis vs pulmonary edema, and potential shunting from patent foramen ovale (PFO). Treatment options include continuing oxygen therapy, diuresis, and optimizing fluid balance.
2. Complicated UTI: The patient has a Klebsiella and enterococci infection in his cultures. This is a risk due to his chronic indwelling Foley catheter. Treatment involves continuing Unasyn for 14 days.
3. Leukocytosis: This may be related to recent steroid use. Monitoring is recommended.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is within normal range and metoprolol has been held. The goal is to maintain a heart rate between 57-60 bpm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for a klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection and pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's chief complaint is hypoxia. The CT chest shows hypersensitivity pneumonitis vs pulmonary edema. He is still hypoxic despite being on high-flow nasal cannula and required increased FiO2 due to coughing spells. The patient has a history of allergies, including Percodan (oxycodone Hcl/Aspirin) and Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium). His last dose of antibiotics was Levofloxacin on 02/15/2017 at 08:06 AM. The patient has been receiving ensure shakes QID and is currently being weaned off oxygen but experienced more hypoxia during the weaning process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased hypoxia, and potential sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which can be caused by heart failure, sepsis, or other factors. This may lead to decreased perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a complicated UTI"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for a klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's hypoxia has shown equivocal improvement, possibly due to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, parenchymal disease, or shunting from patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient has completed a course of antibiotics and is being diuresed to optimize fluid balance. He is also being weaned off CPAP.

The patient has a complicated UTI caused by klebsiella and enterococci, which is likely due to chronic indwelling Foley catheter. He will continue receiving Unasyn for 14 more days.

The patient also exhibits leukocytosis, likely due to recent steroid use. His tachycardia is not related to atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and metoprolol has been held. The patient's metastatic prostate cancer requires outpatient follow-up.

Additionally, the patient has immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) with a normal platelet count, hyperlipidemia, and stage IV chronic renal failure, which is stable and requires avoidance of nephrotoxins and renal dosing of medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. He is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and has been transferred to the ICU. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/51 mmHg to 77/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving various medications including steroids, lasix, heparin, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of inadequate oxygen supply to the body's tissues. This can lead to organ damage and dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings in the 80s suggest episodes of low blood pressure, which may be due to hypovolemia (low fluid volume). This can result in inadequate perfusion of organs and tissues.
3. Complicated UTI: The presence of klebsiella and enterococci in cultures indicates a complicated UTI. If left untreated, this infection can spread to other parts of the body, leading to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, admitted for klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia (pna), who is now in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement with steroids, suggesting non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP). The patient's medical history includes complicated UTI due to klebsiella and enterococci, leukocytosis likely caused by steroids, tachycardia without any episodes of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), metastatic prostate cancer, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) with normal platelet count, hyperlipidemia, stage IV chronic renal failure, and congestive heart failure (CHF) with preserved systolic function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's primary issue at the moment is hypoxia, which has led to his transfer to the ICU. Non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) is suspected as the cause of his respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory function will be necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient occasionally experiences low blood pressure in the 80s, indicating potential hypovolemia. This may require adjustments to diuretic therapy and fluid management.
3. Complicated UTI: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of weakness and fever. The patient's initial reason for MICU admission was hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to Percodan (Oral) and Lipitor (Oral), but the specific allergens are unknown. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/58 mmHg to 132/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,106 mL and total output of 1,225 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -119 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, platelet count of 716 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen level of 66 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and glucose level of 168 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes show a sodium level of 24 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride level of 108 mEq/L, and magnesium level of 2.5 mg/dL. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided in the note. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments were not performed. 

The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions, including hypoxemia, pneumonia (hospital-acquired, non-ventilator-associated), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), urinary tract infection (UTI), hypotension (not in shock), tachycardia (other), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF). 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilation support through a nasal cannula. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of pneumonia, worsening heart failure, and potential sepsis secondary to the UTI. 

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the information provided in the progress note, and a comprehensive evaluation of the patient would require additional clinical information and assessments."

","Summary:
The patient is a 94-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and is now in the ICU. The patient's chief complaints are weakness and fever. He has a history of chronic indwelling Foley catheter, which may have contributed to the UTI. His allergies include Percodan (oral) and Lipitor (oral). He received vancomycin until 2/17/2117 and ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) until 2/19/2117. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure 113/58 mmHg, heart rate 66 bpm, respiratory rate 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% on nasal cannula. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for weakness and fever. The patient has a history of stage IV chronic renal failure, metastatic prostate cancer, hyperlipidemia, and congestive heart failure (CHF) with preserved systolic function. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is improving with steroids, suggesting non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP). Hold on diuresis, change steroids to 60mg prednisone daily for at least 2 weeks,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer who was admitted for a klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing ongoing hypoxia despite receiving treatment. This could be due to hypersensitivity pneumonitis or non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP).

2. Hypotension: The patient occasionally has blood pressures in the 80s, indicating possible hypovolemia. This could be related to diuretic use or ongoing fluid losses.

3. Complicated UTI: The patient has klebsiella and enterococci in his cultures, suggesting a complicated UTI. This may be due to chronic indwelling Foley catheter use.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely secondary to recent steroid administration.

5. Tachycardia: The patient has an increased heart rate, but it is not attributed to any specific cause other than possible infection or hypoxemia.

6. Metastatic prostate cancer: The patient has metastatic prostate cancer, which requires ongoing outpatient follow-up.

   # Hypoxia
 Improvement with steroids would suggest non-specific
   interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP).
   - hold on diuresis as was orthostatic yesterday
   - change steroids to 60mg prednisone daily for at least 2 wks

   # Hypotension
   Continues to occasionally have BPs 80s typically orthostatic. Likely
   secondary to autonomic instability vs deconditioning.
   - OOB to chair
   - Physical therapy
   - Continue decreased metoprolol to Q8h
   - hold on diuresis

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia (pna). He is now in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient has been on various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, steroids, antibiotics, and other ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's primary concern is hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may lead to inadequate oxygenation of tissues.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which can progress and cause worsening respiratory symptoms.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a complicated UTI caused by klebsiella and enterococci. If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis and systemic infection.
4. Heart failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure, which may worsen if his cardiac function deteriorates further.
5. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient has experienced episodes of tachycardia, and if not managed properly,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for a klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and possible pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and was found to have hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) versus nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). The patient's hypoxemic respiratory distress improved with steroids and he transitioned from high-flow oxygen to room air. However, he still experiences desaturation with movement, likely due to a dynamic shunt and patent foramen ovale (PFO) on echocardiogram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress could worsen if he experiences further desaturation or if his underlying lung condition deteriorates.
2. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient's blood pressure drops significantly upon standing, which may lead to falls or syncope.
3. Complicated UTI: The patient has klebsiella and enterococci in his cultures, putting him at risk for further infection. If his UTI does not improve with current treatment, he may develop sepsis or experience a spread of the infection.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be due to steroid treatment or a new infection. If it is caused by a new infection, it could progress to sepsis.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and possible pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and was found to have hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) versus nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). The patient's main issues include hypoxemic respiratory distress, hypotension, complicated UTI, leukocytosis, tachycardia, metastatic prostate cancer, hyperlipidemia, and stage IV chronic renal failure. 

The patient's respiratory distress has improved with steroids and he has been weaned off the high-flow nasal cannula (HFM) to a nasal cannula (NC). However, he still experiences desaturation with movement, likely due to a dynamic shunt possibly related to a patent foramen ovale (PFO) seen on echocardiogram. 

The patient's orthostatic hypotension has been managed by holding diuretics and adjusting his beta-blocker medication. His complicated UTI has been treated with a change in antibiotics from Unasyn to Augmentin. 

Leukocytosis may be attributed to recent steroid use or a new infection, especially considering the development of diarrhea. The patient is now on broad-spectrum antibiotics and a test for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is pending.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection (UTI) and possible pneumonia (PNA). He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and was found to have hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) versus nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). The patient's condition improved with steroids and he transitioned from high-flow oxygen to nasal cannula. However, he still experiences desaturation with movement, likely due to a dynamic shunt (patent foramen ovale) identified on echocardiogram.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 113/58 mmHg to 132/67 mmHg, heart rate of 66 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. His weight is currently 80 kg, and he has a height of 68 inches.

The patient has a history of allergies to Percodan (oral), Lipitor (oral), and unknown allergies to both medications. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 02/17/2117 at 08:34 AM and ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) on 02/19/2117 at 04:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving several medications including hepar"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient has a history of allergies to Percodan, Lipitor, and unknown allergies to Vancomycin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 02/17/2117 at 08:34 AM and Ampicillin/Sulbactam on 02/19/2117 at 04:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving Heparin Sodium as prophylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/58 mmHg to 132/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device. The patient's ABG results are not provided.

The patient has received multiple medications and treatments, including fluids, antibiotics, and other ICU medications. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,106 mL and output of 1,225 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 119 mL.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, the creatinine levels have fluctuated between 1.6 mg/dL and 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]yo male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for
   klebsiella/enterococcus UTI and ? PNA, who is transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for
   hypoxic respiratory failure, found to have HP vs. NSIP.
   # Hypoxemic resp distress
 Chest CT with diffuse opacities c/w NSIP
   vs. HP.  No clear precipitant for HP. Improved with steroids and went
   from HFM to NC. Still desats with movement, likely [**2-9**] dynamic shunt (+
   PFO on echo)
   - hold on diuresis as orthostatic
   - changed steroids to 60mg prednisone daily, will likely require
   several weeks, will taper depending on clinical response
   - Bactrim ppx
   - PPI if develops GERD symptoms
   - FSG, ISS
   # Hypotension: orthostatic with PT yesterday.  BBL decreased to Q8 from
   Q6.
   - Continue TBB goal of even
   - Continue metoprolol to Q8h
   - Recheck orthostatics today
   # Complicated UTI:  Klebsiella and enterococci in cultures.  At risk
   due to chronic indwelling Foley.
   - changed unasyn to augmentin yesterday, plan on 14 day course. Last
   day [**2-28**].
   # Leukocytosis: ?[**2-9**] steroids vs. new infection.  Now with diarrhea, on
   broad-spectrum abx.
   - check c. diff
   # Tachycardia:  had episodes of AVNRT, none in recent few days.
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg PO Q8H
   # Metastatic prostate cancer: Outpatient follow-up
   # Hyperlipidemia: on statin, ASA.
   # Stage IV Chronic Renal Failure: Stable
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medications

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer admitted for a klebsiella/enterococcus urinary tract infection and possible pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and was found to have hypersensitivity pneumonitis versus nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. The patient's respiratory distress improved with steroids and he no longer requires high-flow oxygen. However, he continues to desaturate with movement, likely due to a dynamic shunt and patent foramen ovale on echo. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, complicated UTI, leukocytosis, tachycardia, metastatic prostate cancer, hyperlipidemia, and stage IV chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if his dynamic shunt and PFO are not adequately managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's orthostatic hypotension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent falls or other complications.
3. Complicated UTI: The patient is at risk of further infection due to chronic indwelling Foley catheter. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and treat any potential infections.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate a new infection or a response to steroid treatment. Close monitoring is required, and further evaluation for infection is needed.
5. Metastatic Prostate Cancer: The patient"
