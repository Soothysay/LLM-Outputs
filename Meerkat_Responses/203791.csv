","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with recurrent squamous cell lung cancer, currently on his 10th cycle of gemcitabine. He presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient has been experiencing acute pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and a non-gap metabolic acidosis. His vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/75 to 118/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's blood cultures have not yet been obtained. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, along with a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 94% indicating possible septic shock, suggests the possibility of sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically while awaiting blood culture results.

2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis needs to be closely monitored for any signs of progression to septic shock or organ dysfunction. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and other relevant parameters will help in assessing the patient's condition.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis may require further investigation to determine the underlying cause. This could be related to renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal issues"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of recurrent squamous cell lung cancer. He is currently in the ICU for fever, hypotension, and tachycardia after receiving his last dose of gemcitabine on 04/20/2152. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for broad coverage, including Vanc, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin. He requires intermittent pressors and has shown improvement in his condition. His vital signs include a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 109/75 to 118/77 mmHg, heart rate of 101 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the current symptoms. His lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient is diagnosed with acute pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and several other medical conditions. His plan includes weaning off neo as tolerated, maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg, monitoring central venous pressure (CVP) and urine output, obtaining sputum culture if possible, and following up with blood and urine cultures. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

 ACUTE PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   59 year old male with recurrent squamous cell lung cancer, now C1D10 of
   gemcitabine, last dose on [**2152-4-20**] who p/w fever, hypotension and
   tachycardia.
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: Presents with recent immunosupression but no
   neutropenia. Pt has fever and hypotension refractory to fluids.
   However, his CVP is 10, he has good urine output and lactate has
   improved which indicates that he is likely volume rescucitated. In
   addition, his mixed venous O2 is c/w sepsi at 94s.  He has no
   localizing source at this time with baseline CXR and neg UA. His shock
   is most likely a distrubtive shock picture and is most likely c/w
   reaction to gemcitabine
   -  wean off neo as tolerated
   - keep MAP 60 or SPB>85
   - monitor CVP and urine output
   - had been on Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin for broad coverage
   - on levoquin chronically
   - if Blood cx neg after 49 hrs would stop Vanc/Cefepime as well
   - f/u blood and urine Cx
   - obtain sputum cx if possible
   .
   # Non-gap metabolic acidosis: pH 7.33/38, bicarb 21, AG 11. Appropriate
   respiratory compensation. Last albumin 3.3 in 2/009. Pt is not having
   diarrhea and has nl creatinine.
   - check albumin
   - will follow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: In sinus rhythm.
   - Continue flecainide, aspirin.
   - restart home diltiazem once 24 hrs off pressors
   .
   # COPD: continue advair, prn albuterol, spiriva
   .
   # Anemia: Likely from bone marrow supression from chemotherapy
   - trend for now
   - guiac stools

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of recurrent squamous cell lung cancer. He is currently in the ICU due to fever, hypotension, and tachycardia following his last dose of gemcitabine on [**2152-4-20**]. The patient has been experiencing acute pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, COPD, anemia, squamous cell carcinoma, FEN (cardiac/heart healthy diet), prophylaxis for DVT and bowel regimen, and presumed full code status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/75 to 118/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93% on a face tent. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a mixed venous O2 saturation of 94%, indicating sepsis.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 5.6 K/uL and 6.1 K/uL on different days, hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 147 and 161 K/uL on different days, creatinine level of 0.6 and 0.7 mg/dL on different days, glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances"

   Chief complaint: Fever/hypotension
   HPI:
   59M with severe SIRS likely as a consequence of recent gemcitabine
   therapy.   Sepsis a possibility but so far no infectious source
   identified on evaluation.  His oxygen requirement appear to be
   declining slowly and may reflect SIRS, PNA, and poor pulm reserve.
   There may be a component of  underlying pulm HTN given the pneumoectomy
   and the prior PE.  RA O2 requirement prior to admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male presenting with fever and hypotension, likely as a consequence of recent gemcitabine therapy. He is suspected to have severe SIRS, which could potentially lead to sepsis. His oxygen requirement appears to be declining, indicating possible SIRS, pneumonia, and poor pulmonary reserve. There may also be a component of underlying pulmonary hypertension due to the pneumoectomy and prior pulmonary embolism. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/60 mmHg to 75/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals regular heart sounds, no breath sounds on the left side, fine dry end inspiratory rales in the right lung 2/3 up, prolonged expiratory phase at the apex, soft abdomen, trace edema, and non-focal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 147 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 27.5 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose of 108 mg/dL, and other laboratory values within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is suspected to have severe SIRS due to recent gemcitabine therapy, with sepsis being a possibility but no infectious source identified yet. His oxygen requirement is declining, indicating possible SIRS, pneumonia, and poor pulmonary reserve. There may also be a component of underlying pulmonary hypertension. The patient is weaned off the pressor, and empiric antibiotics are being administered pending culture data. If the culture is negative, antibiotics will be discontinued and levofloxacin will continue. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) will be done to rule out pulmonary embolism and evaluate for possible pneumonia. The patient's B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will also be checked. Antiarrhythmic therapy will be continued, and the patient is not on anticoagulation due to bleeding risk. Fluids will be given if the patient is hypotensive. Hypoxemia will be managed with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and Atrovent every six hours. Empirical solute-mediated will be started at 125 mcg every six hours. The patient's home medications will be held until blood pressure improves, and he will continue with his home regimen for COPD, which may include anxiolytics for dyspnea. If dyspnea worsens, BiPAP will be attempted. The patient will receive regular diet and glycemic control will be monitored. ICU care will be provided, including prophylaxis"

   tachycardia.
   .
   # Hypotension/Fever: Presents with recent immunosupression but no
   neutropenia. Pt has fever and hypotension refractory to fluids.
   However, his CVP is 10, he has good urine output and lactate has
   improved which indicates that he is likely volume rescucitated. In
   addition, his mixed venous O2 is c/w sepsi at 94s.  He has no
   localizing source at this time with baseline CXR and neg UA. His shock
   is most likely a distrubtive shock picture and is most likely c/w
   reaction to gemcitabine.
   - wean off neo as tolerated
   - keep MAP 60 or SPB>85
   - monitor CVP and urine output
   - cont Vanc/Cefepime/Levofloxacin for broad coverage
   - check CTA of chest, d/c Vanc / Cefepime if no infiltrate
   - if Blood cx neg after 48 hrs would stop Vanc/Cefepime as well
   - on levoquin chronically

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of recurrent squamous cell lung cancer.
- He presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia.
- The patient has been experiencing immunosuppression due to chemotherapy but does not have neutropenia.
- He has received antibiotics for broad coverage and is currently on Vanc, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin.
- The patient's shock is likely distributive in nature and possibly related to a reaction to gemcitabine.
- He is being monitored closely for any changes in vital signs, including CVP and urine output.
- Further investigations are planned, including a chest CT scan, blood cultures, and sputum cultures.
- The patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis is being managed appropriately.
- He is in sinus rhythm and on appropriate medications for atrial fibrillation.
- His COPD is being managed with inhalers and bronchodilators as needed.
- Anemia is likely due to bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
- Treatment for squamous cell carcinoma will be determined by the oncologist once the infection resolves.
- The patient is on a cardiac/heart healthy diet and prophylactic heparin.
- Code status is full code.
- Disposition is still in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient's refractory hypotension and fever suggest sepsis. However,"

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with recurrent squamous cell lung cancer currently on his 10th cycle of gemcitabine. He presents with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient has been weaned off Neo and is experiencing hypoxia. He has a history of pneumonectomy and shows diffuse right lung opacities, a new small right pleural effusion, and a middle lobe nodule that is likely infectious. There is also thickening of the left hilar stump and pleural nodules. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 128/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

The patient has received several antibiotics, including levofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. He is also on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as other ICU medications. 

His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.1 K/uL, thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 147, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.4 mEq/L, and an elevated lactate level of 3.4 mg/dL. His ABG results show a pH of 7.33/38, bicarbonate level of 21, and an AG of 11. 

The patient is being treated for sepsis with no localizing source identified. His shock is most likely distributive shock due to a reaction to gemcitabine. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory distress, worsening sepsis, and possible organ dysfunction."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with recurrent squamous cell lung cancer who is currently in the ICU. He presents with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia after receiving the last dose of gemcitabine on [**2152-4-20**]. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 128/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds over the right lung, mild tachypnea when speaking, and no signs of edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count of 147 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 108 mg/dL, and an albumin level of 2.9 g/dL. The patient's blood culture results are pending.

The assessment and plan include sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, acute pain, and cancer (malignant neoplasm), among others. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of recurrent squamous cell lung cancer, currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment. He presents with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient has undergone a left pneumonectomy and is now experiencing respiratory distress. He has no localizing source for infection, and his shock is most likely due to a reaction to gemcitabine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, along with a mixed venous O2 saturation of 94%, indicate the possibility of sepsis.
2. Distributive Shock: The patient's distributive shock picture suggests a potential reaction to gemcitabine.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of lung cancer and pneumonectomy, along with the presence of diffuse right lung opacities and a small right pleural effusion, may indicate respiratory distress.
4. Anemia: The patient's likely bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy could lead to anemia.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.33/38 and bicarb of 21.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in sinus rhythm, but has a history of atrial fibrillation.

Note: These potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with severe SIRS likely due to recent gemcitabine therapy. Sepsis is a possibility but no infectious source has been identified yet. The patient's oxygen requirements are declining slowly and may reflect SIRS, pneumonia, and poor pulmonary reserve. There may also be a component of underlying pulmonary hypertension given the pneumonectomy and prior pulmonary embolism.

The patient was off neo and started on solmol. A CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism, but the patient had a problem with chest wound from anticoagulation and reported hemoptysis. The patient has a history of recurrent NSCLC and COPD. He received gemcitabine therapy, and his COPD symptoms may need anxiolytics for dyspnea. If the symptoms worsen, BiPAP will be tried.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 118/75 mmHg (86/54-128/93 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 5L. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,349 mL and output of 4,270 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,921 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with severe SIRS likely due to recent gemcitabine therapy. He has a history of sepsis, hypoxemia, pancytopenia, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, recurrent NSCLC, and COPD. The patient is currently on various medications including antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. He is also receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has been weaned off the pressor. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires supplemental oxygen. His lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's microurine test is negative, and Legionella test is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of severe SIRS, which can progress to sepsis if an infectious source is identified.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirement is declining, indicating potential respiratory failure. This could be due to underlying pulmonary hypertension or complications from the recent pneumonectomy.
3. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive despite being on vasopressors. This could indicate inadequate perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood cell counts (white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets) may increase the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and current diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, acute pain, and lung cancer. He is admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. The patient has been receiving antibiotics and other medications as per the treatment plan. His vital signs are within acceptable ranges, except for low blood pressure and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 2,921 mL since 12 AM. Laboratory results indicate slightly low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal electrolyte levels. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings are not assessed in several areas such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessment, etc.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating a possible ongoing or recent infection. This increases the risk of developing further infections or complications related to infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently below the normal range, indicating hypotension. This may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Lung Cancer: The patient's underlying lung cancer can progress and cause complications such as respiratory distress or spread of the malignancy to other organs.
4. Pain Management: The patient is experiencing acute pain,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with severe SIRS likely due to recent gemcitabine therapy. He is also experiencing fever and hypotension, which could indicate sepsis. The patient's oxygen requirement is declining, suggesting possible underlying pulmonary hypertension given his history of pneumonectomy and previous pulmonary embolism. He has been weaned off neo and started on solumedol. The patient has no known drug allergies. He received antibiotics including levofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. He is currently on multiple medications such as ASA, Neurontin, Advair, flecainide, levofloxacin, vanc, atrovent, cefepime, and hep.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of malignancy in the lung, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, cefepime), pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/69 mmHg to 128/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -315 mL. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's low blood pressure, elevated white blood cell count, and recent antibiotic use indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently below normal, indicating hypotension.
3. Acute pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, which may be due to underlying conditions or medical procedures.
4. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung:"

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with severe SIRS likely as a consequence of recent gemcitabine therapy. Sepsis is a possibility, but no infectious source has been identified so far. The patient requires supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and is being weaned as tolerated. He is also receiving Atrovent q6 and empirical solmedol 125Q6. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/69 mmHg to 128/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Physical examination findings include regular heart sounds, no bronchial sounds on the left side, fine dry end-inspiratory rales in the right lung one-third up, improved. Prolonged expiratory phase at the apex, soft abdomen, trace edema, no rashes, and non-focal neurologic examination. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.6-6.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count of 147-161 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 0.6-0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 108-103 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with severe SIRS likely due to recent gemcitabine therapy. He has been experiencing fever and hypotension. The patient's oxygen requirement appears to be declining, which may be related to SIRS, pneumonia, and poor pulmonary reserve. There is a possibility of underlying pulmonary hypertension given the patient's medical history. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmics. He also has a history of pulmonary embolism, recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, COPD, and dyspnea.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis as indicated by the presence of fever and hypotension, along with no infectious source identified on evaluation.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate hypoxemia, which may be due to an interstitial process or other underlying lung conditions.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, characterized by low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count. This may be related to chemotherapy.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient is on antiarrhythmic therapy, suggesting a history of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, indicating a risk for thrombotic events.
6. Infection: Given the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of recurrent squamous cell lung cancer, admitted for the 10th cycle of gemcitabine. He presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to a reaction to gemcitabine. He is currently in the ICU, receiving various medications and treatments for his conditions including sepsis, atrial fibrillation, COPD, anemia, and squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/69 mmHg to 128/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient appears comfortable and shows no signs of oral ulcers or abnormal heart sounds. His lungs are clear bilaterally, abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present, and extremities are warm with no edema or palpable distal pulses. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but his serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are slightly elevated. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with recurrent squamous cell lung cancer. He was admitted for the fifth cycle of gemcitabine. The patient presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. His fever is now resolved, but he continues to require face tent intermittently. He has no known drug allergies. The patient received antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime) for suspected sepsis. He also received pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever.

Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 91 bpm (with a normal range of 91-110 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 109/69 mmHg to 128/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 20-32 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula at 4 L/min and 50% face tent. The patient is in sinus rhythm with regular S1 and S2 heart sounds. His lungs are clear bilaterally with no wheezing or rales, but he has decreased left base. The patient has warm extremities without edema or m/r/g. His neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory Results:
The patient's laboratory results show leukocyte count ranging from 5.6 to 6.1 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level ranging from 9.4 to 10.3 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 147 to 161 thousand/mm³, creatinine level ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 mg/dL, glucose level ranging from 108 to 160 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

Radiology:
The patient's chest X-ray shows stable post-pneumonectomy appearance with increased reticular nodular opacity in the right mid- and lower lung, concerning for volume overload, infection, or post-pneumonectomy syndrome.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is improving from sepsis, likely a reaction to gemcitabine. His antibiotics will be continued, and follow-up cultures will be obtained if he becomes febrile again. The patient will continue steroids for gemcitabine-related inflammatory lung disease and will follow daily for anemia, likely due to bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy. The patient's COPD will be managed with Advair, albuterol as needed, and Spiriva. The patient's squamous cell carcinoma treatment will be continued once his infection resolves."

   Assessment and Plan
   59 year old male with recurrent squamous cell lung cancer, admitted
   C1D10 of gemcitabine, last dose on [**2152-4-20**] who p/w fever, hypotension
   and tachycardia.
   # Sepsis:  Clinically much improved.  Thought likely a reaction to
   gemcitabine. No organisms identified. SOB probably multifactorial with
   COPD, s/p pneumonectomy, gemcitabine effect and ?infection.
   - Continue steroids for Gemcitabine-related inflammatory lung disease.
   Will change to solumedrol 60q6 and plan to taper.
   - Repeat CXR today
   - Continue home levo, would stop vanc and cefepime today
   - Follow up cultures and reculture if febrile. Check sputum if making
   any.
   # Atrial fibrillation: In sinus rhythm.
   - Continue flecainide, aspirin.
   - Restart home diltiazem today
   # COPD: continue advair, prn albuterol, spiriva
   # Anemia: Likely from bone marrow supression from chemotherapy
   - follow daily, maintain active t+S, transfuse hct>25
   - Guiac stools
   # Squamous cell carcinoma: s/p neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide with
   concomitant radiation completed [**2151-1-13**] for squamous cell lung cancer
   s/p left pneumonectomy on [**2151-3-4**] and s/p first dose of palliative
   Taxotere on [**2-3**].
   - Treatment per Onc when infection resolves
   - Add on ANC today. WBC declining, likely due to recent chemotherapy.
   Needs CBC with diff today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of recurrent squamous cell lung cancer. He was admitted for C1D10 of gemcitabine treatment and presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for sepsis, atrial fibrillation, COPD, anemia, and squamous cell carcinoma. He has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/69 to 128/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on a nasal cannula with 50% face tent. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, warm extremities, and no signs of edema or ulcers. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows stable post-pneumonectomy appearance with increased reticular nodular opacity in the right mid- and lower lung, concerning for volume overload, infection, or post-pneumonectomy syndrome. The patient's condition is improving, and he will be transitioned to the floor today.
