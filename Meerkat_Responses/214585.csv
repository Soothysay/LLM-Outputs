","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with prior amputations, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and stents, and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-40%. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during surgery, which may have been secondary to hypoxia or a profound vagal response. There are also concerns about the possibility of a myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pericardial effusion, although these have been ruled out by cardiology. The patient also has a septic left wrist joint, for which he underwent washout in the operating room. He has an allergy to penicillins and is currently on several medications including heparin sodium, epinephrine, and propofol. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 100/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications may include:

1. Infection: The patient has a septic left wrist joint, and there is a risk of further infection due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with amputations, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and stents, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30-40%, and hypertension (HTN).

The patient was admitted to the ICU due to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which occurred during induction and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) placement. The cause of the arrest is unclear, with possible contributing factors including hypoxia, bradycardia, profound vagal response during intubation, myocardial infarction (MI), or pulmonary embolism (PE). Further evaluation is needed, including discussion with anesthesia, obtaining an echocardiogram, monitoring on telemetry, cycling enzymes, weaning epinephrine and phenylephrine, and planning for extubation in the morning.

The patient also has a septic left wrist joint, which was washed out in the operating room with removal of [known first name] pus. The wound culture grew gram-negative rods (GNRs), and the patient is allergic to penicillins. Therefore, aztreonam was started instead of vancomycin. The patient"

   somewhat unclear. It is possible that during induction and LMA

   Likewise, the patient may have had a profound vagal episode during

   metoprolol which may have precipitated or contributed to bradycardia.
   Patient may also have had an MI, although with bradycardia you would
   expect inferior wall involvement and there are no changes in EKG in
   II,III and AVF. There was a suggestion in quick intra-op echo that his
   EF was further depression; no tamponade or effusion. Per cardiology, no

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with amputations, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and stents, and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-40%. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during surgery, which appeared to be secondary to hypoxia. The exact events are unclear, but it is possible that the patient became hypoxic during induction and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) placement, leading to bradycardia and PEA. The patient may also have had a profound vagal response during intubation or an acute myocardial infarction (MI), although there were no changes in the EKG leads II, III, and AVF. There was a suggestion of further depression in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on intraoperative echocardiogram (TEE), but no evidence of tamponade or effusion. The patient's kidney function is compromised, as indicated by a creatinine level of 10. He has a history of septic joint, which was treated with washout in the operating room and identified GNRs. The patient has a penicillin allergy, so alternative antibiotics will be required. The patient's conditions include acute respiratory distress, septic joint, end-stage"

He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a postoperative cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) following a surgical procedure. The patient initially presented with symptoms of respiratory failure and was placed on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's condition worsened, leading to the development of increasing pain and swelling in his left wrist. He was subsequently admitted to another hospital with a temperature of 101.4Â°F, white blood cell count of 13.6, and pain in his left hand. He was determined to have septic arthritis in his left wrist and underwent surgical debridement. 

During anesthesia induction for the surgical procedure, the patient reportedly developed hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension, which may have been due to a brief episode of asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed, along with the administration of epinephrine and atropine, resulting in eventual hemodynamic stabilization.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, heart disease, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a postoperative cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient had previously been treated for an infected left wrist, which resulted in septicemia and subsequent surgical debridement. He developed hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension during anesthesia induction, requiring CPR and pharmacological agents. The patient underwent a surgical washout procedure of the left wrist and drainage of purulent material. He received numerous pharmacological agents during the procedure. Following his return to the PACU, he experienced recurrent hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension, responding to epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions. The patient remains intubated and is currently in the MICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's septic left wrist has led to gram-negative bacteremia, indicating a systemic infection that can progress to sepsis if not adequately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's postoperative respiratory failure may be attributed to sepsis or a contribution of hemodynamic instability. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial to prevent further respiratory compromise.
3. Pleural Effusion"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's progress note indicates that they are a 65-year-old individual with a history of hypertension, NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), ESRD (end-stage renal disease), HD (heart disease), CAD (coronary artery disease), and PVD (peripheral vascular disease). The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a PEA (pulseless electrical activity) arrest post-operatively.

The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and was placed on mechanical ventilation. They developed increasing pain and swelling in their left wrist, which led to the diagnosis of septic left wrist. Antibiotics were administered, but there was no appreciable progress, prompting a surgical debridement. During the anesthesia induction, the patient developed hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension, possibly indicating a brief episode of asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed, along with the administration of epinephrine and atropine, resulting in hemodynamic stabilization. The patient then underwent a surgical washout procedure of the left wrist and drainage of purulent material.

Following the procedure, the patient experienced recurrent hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions. The patient remained intubated and was transferred to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) for further evaluation and management."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current symptoms, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis due to an infected left wrist, which was confirmed by the presence of gram-negative bacteria in the blood. This increases the risk of further systemic infection and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure postoperatively, likely due to sepsis and possible contributions from hemodynamic instability. There is also a new right lower lobe density, which could indicate a pleural effusion or infiltrate. The etiology of the PEA arrest is unclear, but it appears to be related to hypoxia and bradycardia.

3. Hypotension: The patient had resolved hypotension, which may be attributed to sepsis-induced vasodilation or the effects of pharmacological agents. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent recurrent episodes.

4. Elevated troponin: The patient has an elevated troponin level, indicating possible cardiac damage. However, it is more likely to be a result of a demand event rather than a primary cardiac event. Trending enzymes and repeating an echo will help determine the extent of cardiac involvement.

5. Renal function: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). It is important to continue HD as planned to manage renal function and prevent further"

   64 yo M with MMP including ESRD on HD, IDDM, PVD s/p amputations, CAD
   s/p CABG and stents, CHF EF 30-40% s/p PEA arrest and septic left wrist
   joint.
   # PEA arrest: Appears to have been secondary to hypoxia but events are
   somewhat unclear. It is possible that during induction and LMA
   placement pt became hypoxic which precipitated bradycardia and PEA.
   Likewise, the patient may have had a profound vagal episode during
   intubation. In the anesthesia record, he received esmolol and
   metoprolol which may have precipitated or contributed to bradycardia.
   Patient may also have had an MI, although with bradycardia you would
   expect inferior wall involvement and there are no changes in EKG in
   II,III and AVF. There was a suggestion in quick intra-op echo that his
   EF was further depression; no tamponade or effusion. Per cardiology, no
   evidence of MI or cardiogenic shock. PE is also a possibility, but
   [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] criteria is low at 1.5%. Patient's K was not elevated. No PTX
   clinically or on CXR. Takotsubo
s may be a possibility as well,
   although TTE does not suggest such. TTE does show reduced EF. Extubated
   yesterday without problem. Now w/ significantly elevated CK, but not
   cardiac fraction, and troponin is down; also w/ significant electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - will need to monitor CK closely
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
    -start ACE-i for reduced EF, DM and CAD
   # Elevated CK - Significantly elevated compared to prior. Unclear
   etiology, does not appear to have compartment syndrome from recent
   wrist surgery. He does also have significant electrolyte abnormalities
   and creatinine bump. ? Rhabdo - would not improve with IVF anyway,
   needs HD. ? if any anethesia medications could cause a NMS-type
   syndrome, but pt has not had high fever (low temps at 99). Plastics
   evaluated and did not think pt had compartment syndrome with good
   pulses and no pain in left forearm. No seizure activity documented
   during event in OR.
   - follow CK
   - renal team aware, to do HD early today, may need 2nd HD session per
   electrolytes
   - appreciate Plastics surgery recs and renal recs
   - monitor closely
   # Confusion - Pt still delirious and requiring frequent re-orientation,
   not improving off mind-altering medications. Could have sustained

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with amputations, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and stents, congestive heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and chronic hypertension.

The patient presented to the ICU with impaired skin integrity in the form of a septic left wrist joint, which required washout during surgery. The patient also has elevated CK levels, significant electrolyte abnormalities, and renal dysfunction requiring hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a septic left wrist joint that requires appropriate antibiotic treatment and wound care.
2. Confusion: The patient is still delirious and requires frequent reorientation. This may be due to anoxic brain injury during the code and hypoxia.
3. Septic joint: The patient has a polymicrobial infection in the joint, which may require further surgical intervention for debridement and mobilization of the wrist.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is rising, indicating a possible infection. Surveillance cultures should be sent, and the patient should be monitored for fever and other signs of infection.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient's creat"

   s/p CABG and stents, CHF EF 30-40% s/p PEA arrest and septic left wrist
   joint.
   # PEA arrest: Appears to have been secondary to hypoxia but events are
   somewhat unclear. It is possible that during induction and LMA
   placement pt became hypoxic which precipitated bradycardia and PEA.
   Likewise, the patient may have had a profound vagal episode during
   intubation. In the anesthesia record, he received esmolol and
   metoprolol which may have precipitated or contributed to bradycardia.
   Patient may also have had an MI, although with bradycardia you would
   expect inferior wall involvement and there are no changes in EKG in
   II,III and AVF. There was a suggestion in quick intra-op echo that his
   EF was further depression; no tamponade or effusion. Per cardiology, no
   evidence of MI or cardiogenic shock. PE is also a possibility, but
   [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] criteria is low at 1.5%. Patient's K was not elevated. No PTX
   clinically or on CXR. Takotsubo
s may be a possibility as well,
   although TTE does not suggest such. Extubated yesterday without
   problem. Now w/ significantly elevated CK, but not cardiac fraction,
   and troponin is down; also w/ significant electrolyte abnormalities.
   - will need to monitor CK closely
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Elevated CK - Significantly elevated compared to prior. Unclear
   etiology, does not appear to have compartment syndrome from recent
   wrist surgery. He does also have significant electrolyte abnormalities
   and creatinine bump. ? Rhabdo - would not improve with IVF anyway,
   needs HD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and stents, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and chronic lower back pain. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to a septic left wrist joint and has undergone multiple interventions including invasive ventilation, blood cultured, trans-thoracic echo, arterial line placement, and multi-lumen placement.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/27 mmHg to 133/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on face tent with CPAP ventilation, and sinus rhythm. The patient is intubated, sedated, and appears ill.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, history of heart disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and postoperative pulseless electrical activity arrest. The patient was admitted to the ICU after developing increasing pain and swelling in the left wrist, which was initially diagnosed as cellulitis but later determined to have septic arthritis of the left wrist. 

The patient underwent a surgical washout procedure of the left wrist and drainage of purulent material. During the procedure, the patient experienced recurrent hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions. The patient remained intubated and was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/27 to 133/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination findings include confusion, tachycardia, clear lungs anteriorly, soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and left wrist bandaged with a blood blister on the left finger. Neurological examination reveals normal movement of all four extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/27 mmHg to 133/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation and has undergone several procedures, including blood culturing, trans-thoracic echo, arterial line placement, and multi-lumen catheter placement. The patient has allergies to penicillins and is currently on multiple medications, including morphine sulfate, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), heparin sodium, and others. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other parameters. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and troponin-T levels, along with abnormal glucose and electrolyte levels. The patient is currently on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and previous cardiac issues including heart disease, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a postoperative cardiac arrest. He developed increasing pain and swelling in his left wrist, which was initially treated at another hospital for suspected cellulitis. However, it was later determined to have septic arthritis of the left wrist. The patient underwent surgical debridement and washout procedure of the left wrist. During the procedure, he experienced recurrent hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions. He remained intubated and was transferred to the MICU for further evaluation and management.

24-hour events include invasive ventilation, blood cultures, trans-thoracic echo, arterial line placement, and multi-lumen catheter placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 88/27 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on face tent. Physical examination reveals confusion, tachycardia, clear lung sounds anteriorly, soft abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and extremities with left wrist bandage, blood blister"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   64 yo M with MMP including ESRD on HD, IDDM, PVD s/p amputations, CAD
   s/p CABG and stents, CHF EF 30-40% s/p PEA arrest and septic left wrist
   joint.
   # PEA arrest: Appears to have been secondary to hypoxia but events are
   somewhat unclear. It is possible that during induction and LMA
   placement pt became hypoxic which precipitated bradycardia and PEA.
   Likewise, the patient may have had a profound vagal episode during
   intubation. In the anesthesia record, he received esmolol and
   metoprolol which may have precipitated or contributed to bradycardia.
   Patient may also have had an MI, although with bradycardia you would
   expect inferior wall involvement and there are no changes in EKG in
   II,III and AVF. There was a suggestion in quick intra-op echo that his
   EF was further depression; no tamponade or effusion. Per cardiology, no
   evidence of MI or cardiogenic shock. PE is also a possibility, but
   [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] criteria is low at 1.5%. Patient's K was not elevated. No PTX
   clinically or on CXR. Takotsubo
s may be a possibility as well,
   although TTE does not suggest such. TTE does show reduced EF. Extubated
   yesterday without problem. Now w/ significantly elevated CK, but not
   cardiac fraction, and troponin is down; also w/ significant electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - will need to monitor CK closely
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
    - cont ACE-i for reduced EF, DM and CAD
   # Elevated CK - Significantly elevated compared to prior. Unclear
   etiology, does not appear to have compartment syndrome from recent
   wrist surgery. He does also have significant electrolyte abnormalities
   and creatinine bump. ? Rhabdo - would not improve with IVF anyway,
   needs HD. ? if any anethesia medications could cause a NMS-type
   syndrome, but pt has not had high fever (low temps at 99). Plastics
   evaluated and did not think pt had compartment syndrome with good
   pulses and no pain in left forearm. No seizure activity documented
   during event in OR.
   - follow CK
   - renal team aware, to do HD early today
   - appreciate Plastics surgery recs and renal recs
   - monitor closely
   # Confusion - Pt still delirious and requiring frequent re-orientation,
   not improving off mind-altering medications. Could have sustained
   anoxic brain injury during code and hypoxia. Confusion improving, no
   HCT needed
   - consider haldol for agitation
   - frequent re-orientation
   # Septic joint: S/p wash out in OR with [**Known firstname **] pus. Wound culture with
   GNR's, also 2/2 bottles from A-line w/ GNRs. Has PCN allergy of hives.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with amputations, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and stents, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 30-40%, and a recent septic left wrist joint. 

The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, which appeared to be secondary to hypoxia. He required resuscitation and intubation, during which he developed bradycardia and pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The cause of the cardiac arrest is still unclear, with possible contributing factors including hypoxia during induction and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) placement, profound vagal response during intubation, myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism (PE), or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. 

Following the cardiac arrest, the patient underwent surgery for a pilonidal cyst and developed elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), troponin-T, and other electrolyte abnormalities. He also experienced confusion and required frequent reorientation. The patient's renal function is severely compromised, with a creatinine level of 10 mg/dL, necessitating hemodialysis three"

   s/p CABG and stents, CHF EF 30-40% s/p PEA arrest and septic left wrist
   joint.
   # PEA arrest: Appears to have been secondary to hypoxia but events are
   somewhat unclear. It is possible that during induction and LMA
   placement pt became hypoxic which precipitated bradycardia and PEA.
   Likewise, the patient may have had a profound vagal episode during
   intubation. In the anesthesia record, he received esmolol and
   metoprolol which may have precipitated or contributed to bradycardia.
   Patient may also have had an MI, although with bradycardia you would
   expect inferior wall involvement and there are no changes in EKG in
   II,III and AVF. There was a suggestion in quick intra-op echo that his
   EF was further depression; no tamponade or effusion. Per cardiology, no
   evidence of MI or cardiogenic shock. PE is also a possibility, but
   [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] criteria is low at 1.5%. Patient's K was not elevated. No PTX
   clinically or on CXR. Takotsubo

   # PEA arrest: Appears to have been secondary to hypoxia but events are
   somewhat unclear. It is possible that during induction and LMA
   placement pt became hypoxic which precipitated bradycardia and PEA.
   Likewise, the patient may have had a profound vagal episode during
   intubation. In the anesthesia record, he received esmolol and
   metoprolol which may have precipitated or contributed to bradycardia.
   Patient may also have had an MI, although with bradycardia you would
   expect inferior wall involvement and there are no changes in EKG in
   II,III and AVF. There was a suggestion in quick intra-op echo that his
   EF was further depression; no tamponade or effusion. Per cardiology, no
   evidence of MI or cardiogenic shock. PE is also a possibility, but

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with amputations, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and stents, congestive heart failure (CHF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF), and chronic confusion.

The patient presented to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and subsequent hypoxia. He was intubated and extubated without complications, but later developed confusion and delirium. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, likely due to his diabetes and poor peripheral circulation.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's troponin levels are decreasing, suggesting that the cardiac arrest may not have been caused by a myocardial infarction. However, the patient's CK (creatine kinase) levels are significantly elevated, which may indicate rhabdomyolysis or a non-cardiac muscle injury.

The patient has an infected left wrist joint with purulence expressed from the wound, and blood cultures have grown Gram-negative rods. The patient has a known allergy to penicillins and is currently receiving aztreonam and vancomycin antibiotics.

The patient's other medical issues include hypertension, which is currently well-controlled, and type"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple medical problems including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure post-percutaneous endoscopic arterial catheterization (PEA) arrest. The patient had a history of pilonidal cyst, but no recent complications were noted. He developed pain and swelling in his left wrist, which led to the diagnosis of septic left wrist joint. The patient underwent surgical debridement and washout procedure of the left wrist, as well as drainage of purulent material. During the procedure, he experienced recurrent hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension, which were managed with epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions. The patient remains intubated and is currently in the MICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, which necessitated ICU admission. This may be due to his underlying chronic heart failure or complications from the PEA arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a septic left wrist joint, indicated by the presence of pus and positive cultures for gram-negative rods. There is also evidence of bacteremia, with GNRs isolated from blood cultures. This requires prompt antibiotic treatment and possible surgical intervention.
3. Cardiogenic shock:"

   s/p CABG and stents, CHF EF 30-40% s/p PEA arrest and septic left wrist
   joint.
   # PEA arrest: Appears to have been secondary to hypoxia but events are
   somewhat unclear. It is possible that during induction and LMA
   placement pt became hypoxic which precipitated bradycardia and PEA.
   Likewise, the patient may have had a profound vagal episode during
   intubation. In the anesthesia record, he received esmolol and
   metoprolol which may have precipitated or contributed to bradycardia.
   Patient may also have had an MI, although with bradycardia you would
   expect inferior wall involvement and there are no changes in EKG in
   II,III and AVF. There was a suggestion in quick intra-op echo that his
   EF was further depression; no tamponade or effusion. Per cardiology, no
   evidence of MI or cardiogenic shock. PE is also a possibility, but
   [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] criteria is low at 1.5%. Patient's K was not elevated. No PTX
   clinically or on CXR. Takotsubo

   although TTE does not suggest such. TTE does show reduced EF. Extubated
   yesterday without problem. Now w/ significantly elevated CK, but not

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a history of myocardial infarction (MI). He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a perioperative cardiac arrest (PEA) following a surgical procedure for septic left wrist joint. The patient developed hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension during anesthesia induction, leading to a brief asystole. He received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with epinephrine and atropine, resulting in hemodynamic stabilization. The patient underwent a surgical washout procedure of the left wrist and drainage of purulent material. Postoperatively, he experienced recurrent hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions. He was successfully extubated the following morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is still delirious and requires frequent reorientation. This could be due to sustained anoxic brain injury during the code and hypoxia.
2. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient may have had an MI, although with bradycardia, you would expect inferior wall involvement, and there were no changes"

   WBC= 13.6, pain in left hand (probable left hand cellulitis
   determined to have septic left wrist.  Lack of appreciable progress on
   antimicrobials prompted scheduling for surgical debridement.
   During anesthesia induction reportedly developed hypoxia, bradycardia

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure and a postoperative cardiac arrest. The patient underwent surgical debridement of a septic left wrist joint and developed recurrent hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension during the procedure. He required epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions for hemodynamic stabilization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PEA Arrest: The patient had a postoperative cardiac arrest, which may have been secondary to hypoxia or a profound vagal episode during intubation. The cause of the arrest is unclear, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Elevated CK: The patient has significantly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, indicating possible muscle damage or rhabdomyolysis. The etiology of the elevated CK is uncertain and should be closely monitored.
3. Electrolyte Abnormalities: The patient has significant electrolyte abnormalities, including hyperkalemia and hypophosphatemia. These abnormalities may require correction.
4. Delirium: The patient remains delirious and requires frequent reorientation. This could be due to anoxic brain injury during the code and hypoxia"

   64 yo M with MMP including ESRD on HD, IDDM, PVD s/p amputations, CAD
   s/p CABG and stents, CHF EF 30-40% s/p PEA arrest and septic left wrist
   joint.
   # PEA arrest: Appears to have been secondary to hypoxia but events are
   somewhat unclear. It is possible that during induction and LMA
   placement pt became hypoxic which precipitated bradycardia and PEA.
   Likewise, the patient may have had a profound vagal episode during
   intubation. In the anesthesia record, he received esmolol and
   metoprolol which may have precipitated or contributed to bradycardia.
   Patient may also have had an MI, although with bradycardia you would
   expect inferior wall involvement and there are no changes in EKG in
   II,III and AVF. There was a suggestion in quick intra-op echo that his
   EF was further depression; no tamponade or effusion. Per cardiology, no
   evidence of MI or cardiogenic shock. PE is also a possibility, but
   [**Doctor Last Name 1808**] criteria is low at 1.5%. Patient's K was not elevated. No PTX
   clinically or on CXR. Takotsubo
s may be a possibility as well,

   yesterday without problem. Now w/ significantly elevated CK, but not
   cardiac fraction, and troponin is down; also w/ significant electrolyte
   abnormalities.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and previous cardiac events including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and stents. The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a perioperative cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) following wrist surgery. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on several medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest during anesthesia induction, which may have been secondary to hypoxia. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause of the cardiac arrest.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to ESRD and diabetes mellitus. This increases the risk of infections and wound complications.
3. Confusion: The patient is still delirious and requires frequent re-orientation, indicating possible anoxic brain injury during the code and hypoxia. It would be necessary to consider haloperidol for agitation and further evaluation if there is no improvement.
4. Elevated Creatine Kinase (CK): The patient has significantly elevated CK levels, which may indicate rhabdomyolysis or an adverse reaction to anesthesia medications. Close monitoring is required, and renal replacement therapy may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and other medical conditions. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory failure and a postoperative cardiac arrest. The patient developed increasing pain and swelling in his left wrist, which was determined to have septic left wrist cellulitis. He underwent surgical debridement and washout procedure of the left wrist, resulting in recurrent hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient remains intubated and is currently being evaluated and managed in the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to recurrent hypoxia and the need for intubation.
2. Infection or sepsis from the septic left wrist, which may require further antimicrobial treatment or surgical intervention.
3. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction due to the patient's history of cardiovascular disease and recent cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure, as the patient has end-stage renal disease and there are elevated levels of creatinine in the lab results.
5. Impaired skin integrity due to poor circulation or other underlying conditions, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
