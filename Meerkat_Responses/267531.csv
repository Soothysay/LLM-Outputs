","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of locally advanced melanoma who presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and atrial flutter. She was intubated after bronchoscopy revealed external bronchial compression. The patient has a mediastinal mass, pulmonary nodules, and weight loss. It is unclear what the primary tumor is, but it could be lymphoma, melanoma, or lung primary. There is concern for metastatic disease, and it is likely that she will not tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved for mass management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury. Close monitoring and adherence to VAP prevention measures such as maintaining head-of-bed elevation and regular mouth care are necessary.

2. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which could be related to pericardial tumor involvement. She is at high risk of recurrence. Rate control with diltiazem should be continued, and anticoagulation should be considered based on further evaluation.

3. Metastatic Disease: Given the presence of a mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules, there is a concern for metastatic disease. Further diagnostic workup, including imaging studies and biopsy, may be needed to determine the extent of metastasis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, who presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and a large mediastinal mass. She has been intubated after bronchoscopy revealed external bronchial compression. Her current condition includes respiratory failure, atrial flutter, asthma, and possible metastatic disease. She is receiving AC ventilation with sedation, and her treatment plan includes nutrition counseling, waiting for pathology results, and receiving recommendations from Internal Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, and Radiation Oncology. She is at high risk for recurrence of atrial flutter and will be monitored closely. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to bronchial compression from the mediastinal mass. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of vital signs, particularly oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, is crucial. The patient may require ongoing respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.

2. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which may be related to pericardial involvement by the tumor. She is currently on rate control medication (diltiazem) to manage her heart rate. Continuous cardiac monitoring is necessary to detect any recurrence of atrial flutter. Anticoagulation may be considered in the future depending on the patient's overall condition and risk factors.

3. Metastatic Disease: Given the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, who was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of atrial flutter and no known drug allergies. The patient received infusions of midazolam and fentanyl, as well as other medications. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 86/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and glucose levels. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased peripheral pulses and not assessed neurologic status. The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute, and atrial flutter. The patient's plan includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a significant past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, who presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, atrial flutter, and a large mediastinal mass. She was intubated after bronchoscopy revealed external bronchial compression. The patient has pulmonary nodules and a likely tumor-related mediastinal mass. There is concern for metastatic disease, and it is unclear whether the primary tumor is lymphoma, melanoma, or lung-related. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of wheezing, which is most likely due to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/53 to 158/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse wheezes in the left lung more than the right, regular heart rhythm, and no signs of pain or discomfort. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as abnormal levels of creatinine, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. The patient's atrial flutter has reverted to normal sinus rhythm but remains at high risk for recurrence. The assessment and plan"

   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and atrial flutter found
   to have large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.
   - Continue AC ventilation with Sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - F/u Path report
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - Await Hem/Onc recs (will see patient on Monday)
   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Echocardiogram for Monday
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem (continue on 60 mg QID)
   .
   #Fever:  No definitive source but in a ventilated patient with
   increasing [**Year (4 digits) 11753**] secretions and drop in O2 sats could be concerning for
   pulmonary infection.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   -f/u sputum cx
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and zosyn for possible VAP
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma who presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and atrial flutter. She was found to have a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She underwent a bronchoscopy that revealed external bronchial compression. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and she required intubation. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation with sedation.

The patient has been experiencing fever, with a temperature of 100.6°F (38.1°C) in the afternoon. Blood cultures were obtained, but the urinalysis does not suggest a urinary tract infection. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, ranging from 99/52 mmHg to 103/69 mmHg. Her heart rate is mostly within the normal range, but there have been instances of sinus tachycardia. The respiratory rate has been stable at 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation has been consistently in the high 80s to low 90s.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.4 thousand/mm3. The platelet count is slightly elevated at 387 thousand/mm3. The rest of the laboratory values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is likely to have a mediastinal mass causing dyspnea"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention,? temporary stent placement
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate in next day.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with Sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - F/u Path report
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - Await Hem/Onc recs (will see patient on Monday)
   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Echocardiogram for Monday
   - Continue vanco/zosyn for now
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , decrease dosage to 30 mg QID.
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile to 102 with leukocytosis.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - check vancomycin trough
   .
   #Fever:  No definitive source but in a ventilated patient with
   increasing thick secretions and drop in O2 sats could be concerning for
   pulmonary infection.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   -f/u sputum cx
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and zosyn for possible VAP (day 2)
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of locally advanced melanoma who presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and was found to have a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. The patient underwent bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression and has been intubated since then. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by atrial flutter.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 102.0 F
- Heart rate: 77 bpm
- Blood pressure: 98/54 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air

The patient is still experiencing thick yellow secretions but more scant on humidified air. She has been receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected pneumonia. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.4 K/uL, elevated platelet count, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels.

The patient has several potential medical complications based on the information provided:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and a chest X-ray showing LLL > RLL infiltrate. She is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but further culture data is pending.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and sputum production. The patient's temperature peaked at 102 overnight and he has thick secretions in his airway. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, set at a tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. Oxygen delivery is being provided through the ventilator, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O. The patient's blood pressure is low, with readings ranging from 54-98 mmHg systolic and 44-67 mmHg diastolic. The patient's heart rate is stable within normal limits, ranging from 72-77 beats per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has a history of atrial flutter, for which he is receiving treatment.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) at 31.7%, and normal platelet count (Plt) at 387 K/uL. Kidney function appears to be normal with a creatinine (Cr) level of 0.4 mg/dL. Blood glucose levels are within normal range"

   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and atrial flutter found
   to have large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma. She presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and atrial flutter. She was found to have a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She underwent bronchoscopy, which revealed external bronchial compression. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever and increased sputum/secretions, which could indicate a possible pulmonary infection. Further evaluation is needed through sputum and blood cultures.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever and increasing thick secretions while on mechanical ventilation raise concerns for VAP. Continuing vancomycin and zosyn may help treat or prevent this condition.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which could be related to pericardial tumor involvement. Rate control with diltiazem will continue, and anticoagulation or aspirin may be considered if there is a recurrence.
4. Mediastinal Mass: The large mediastinal mass is causing dyspnea and weight loss. Definitive therapy for the mass management will likely be required, and the patient may not tolerate extubation until then.
5. Pulmonary Nodules: The presence of pulmonary nodules suggests possible metastatic disease. Further evaluation"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several significant findings. The patient has a fever of 102.3°F and an elevated white blood cell count of 16.4 K/uL, indicating an infection. The sputum culture revealed the presence of Moraxella catarrhalis, for which antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and Levofloxacin. Additionally, the patient has a mediastinal mass compressing the heart, which may cause potential complications such as cardiac tamponade or impaired cardiac function.

The transthoracic echo showed no diastolic dysfunction or pathologic valvular disease, but there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam, followed by Levofloxacin and Vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 39.1°C, current temperature of 37°C, heart rate between 76-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/45-121/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm.

In terms of fluid balance, the total input was 3,436 mL, with 1,280 mL taken orally, 1,876 mL given intravenously, and 1,512 mL returned as urine output. The total output was 1,785 mL, including 1,785 mL as urine output. The respiratory support shows the patient on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure at 37 cmH2O, plateau pressure at 25 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 290 K/uL, platelet count of 387 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 11 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, sodium level of 132 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, chloride level of 98 mEq/L, and glucose level of 143 mg/dL. Other lab values including PT, PTT, INR, and differential white blood cell count are within normal ranges.

The patient's current plan includes left mainstem stent placement today with intraprocedural (IP) guidance. The assessment and plan section also mentions ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring due to the presence of infection, mediastinal mass compressing the heart, and the need for mechanical ventilation. Potential complications to watch out for include cardiac tamponade, impaired cardiac function, and further respiratory issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate in next day.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today; need
   to touch base with IP to discuss when the patient will be going to OR.
   - will decrease respiratory rate by 2 at a time until the patient is
   overbreathing the vent.  At that time, patient can more easily be
   transitioned to PSV.
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - F/u Path report (expect cytology today)
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - F/U Hem/Onc recs
   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Echocardiogram for Monday
   - Continue vanco/levofloxacin for now
   - F/U sputum cx sensitivities, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , maintain dosage to 30 mg QID and
   monitor for hypotension.
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile with leukocytosis. Xray today concerning for
   increase in infiltrate versus left pleural effusion.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/levofloxacin
   - check vancomycin trough and dose appropriately
   - CT Chest (non contrast) to eval lung parenchyma to eval effusion
   versus airspace disease
   .
   #Fever:  No definitive source but in a ventilated patient with
   increasing thick secretions and drop in O2 sats could be concerning for
   pulmonary infection.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   Moraxella in sputum.
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and levaquin for possible VAP (day 3)
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has been intubated due to a large mediastinal mass causing external bronchial compression. There is also evidence of pneumonia, with an increase in infiltrate seen on the chest X-ray. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been fluctuating, indicating possible respiratory distress. 

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which may be related to the pericardial tumor involvement. There is concern for recurrent atrial flutter and rate control measures have been implemented.

3. Infectious Complications: The patient has been febrile with leukocytosis, suggesting an infection. The sputum culture revealed Moraxella catarrhalis, and antibiotics have been changed to vancomycin and levofloxacin. There is a suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient's blood cultures are pending.

4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of melanoma with locally advanced disease. There is concern for possible bowel involvement or obstruction due to the mediastinal mass.

5. Hematologic Complications: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which indicates an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

6. Metastatic Disease: The patient's large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules raise concerns for metastatic disease"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate in next day.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with Sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - F/u Path report (expect cytology today)
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - Await Hem/Onc recs (will see patient on Monday)
   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Echocardiogram for Monday
   - Continue vanco/zosyn for now
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , decrease dosage to 30 mg QID.
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile with leukocytosis.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - check vancomycin trough
   .
   #Fever:  No definitive source but in a ventilated patient with
   increasing thick secretions and drop in O2 sats could be concerning for
   pulmonary infection.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   Moraxella in sputum.
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and zosyn for possible VAP (day 2)
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of locally advanced melanoma who presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and was found to have a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She has been intubated after a bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression. Her hospital course has been complicated by atrial flutter. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and has shown no definitive source of fever. The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, and she is planned for an OR intervention today for left mainstem stent placement. The mediastinal mass is likely related to her tumor and may be causing dyspnea and weight loss. It is unclear whether it is lymphoma, melanoma, or lung primary, but there is concern for metastatic disease. She is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has an increased risk of recurrence of atrial flutter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
   - Barotrauma or bronchial rupture due to high pressures during mechanical ventilation
   - Aspiration pneumonia due to impaired swallowing and increased secretions

2. Cardiac Complications:
   - Recurrence of atrial flutter or development of other arrhythmias
   - Right heart strain or failure due to pulmonary hypertension caused by the mediastinal mass

3. Infectious Complications:
   - Seps"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma who presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and was found to have a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She is currently intubated after a bronchoscopy revealed external bronchial compression.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/68 mmHg to 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her current medication includes fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and vancomycin.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood urea nitrogen level. Imaging studies reveal extremely large retrotracheal mediastinal adenopathy obstructing the left main and lower lobe bronchi, resulting in left lower lobe collapse. There are also large pulmonary metastases in the right upper and middle lobes, as well as moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include respiratory distress due to airway obstruction caused by the mediastinal mass, pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and atrial flutter. The patient's recent episode of increased sputum/"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention
 taken off of OR list for
   today; will F/U IP recs
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate when stable after IP intervention.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - Path report consistent with metastatic malignant melanoma
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - F/U Hem/Onc recs
   - Rad onc c/s
 currently obtaining CT abd/pelvis (? Need chest as
   well) and MR brain for staging. Will have rad onc evaluate patient
   today.
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Continue vanco/levofloxacin for now
   - F/U sputum cx sensitivities, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   - likely transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after IP intervention (and when clinically
   stable after intervention)
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , maintain dosage to 30 mg QID and
   monitor for hypotension (increase holding parameter to 110)
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile with leukocytosis. Xray today concerning for
   increase in infiltrate versus left pleural effusion.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/levofloxacin
   - check vancomycin trough and dose appropriately
   .
   #Fever:  Concerning for pulmonary infection with sputum culture
   currently growing Moraxella in conjunction with thick secretions and
   drop in O2 sats.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   Moraxella in sputum.
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and levaquin for possible VAP (day 4)
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.

   1. Extremely large retrotracheal mediastinal adenopathy, obstructing
   the left main and lower lobe bronchi, resulting in left lower lobe
   collapse.
   2. Large pulmonary metastases in the right upper and middle lobes.
   3. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate when stable after IP intervention.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - Path report consistent with metastatic malignant melanoma
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - F/U Hem/Onc recs
   - Rad onc c/s
 currently obtaining CT abd/pelvis (? Need chest as
   well) and MR brain for staging
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Continue vanco/levofloxacin for now
   - F/U sputum cx sensitivities, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   - likely transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after IP intervention (and when clinically
   stable after intervention)
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , maintain dosage to 30 mg QID and
   monitor for hypotension.
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile with leukocytosis. Xray today concerning for
   increase in infiltrate versus left pleural effusion.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/levofloxacin
   - check vancomycin trough and dose appropriately
   .
   #Fever:  Concerning for pulmonary infection with sputum culture
   currently growing Moraxella in conjunction with thick secretions and
   drop in O2 sats.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   Moraxella in sputum.
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and levaquin for possible VAP (day 4)
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of locally advanced melanoma who presented with dysphagia and worsening dyspnea. She was found to have a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy that revealed external bronchial compression.

The patient's current condition includes being intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, atrial flutter, and a mediastinal mass causing dyspnea and weight loss. The mediastinal mass may be related to lymphoma, melanoma, or lung primary. There is concern for metastatic disease due to the left atrial descent.

The patient's medical team plans to proceed with an operation for the placement of a stent in the left main bronchus today. They also plan to reposition the endotracheal tube (ETT) more than 5 cm above the carina.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.4, slightly elevated platelet count of 387, and normal kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.4.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated events. The patient's recent fever and increased secretions suggest possible V"

   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma. She has been admitted to the ICU due to a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement.
- The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and was transferred to the ICU to begin radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.
- The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to the mediastinal mass obstructing the left main and lower lobe bronchi, as well as the right lower lobe bronchus. There is also evidence of bilateral pleural effusions.
- The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella.
- The patient has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be indicative of superior vena cava syndrome (SVC syndrome), despite the CTA indicating a patent SVC.
- The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, potentially due to dilutional hemolysis, blood loss, or anemia.
- The patient experienced atrial flutter, which has since reverted to normal sinus rhythm. However, there is a high risk of recurrence, and the decision regarding anticoagulation is uncertain.
- The patient has wheezing, likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. The patient was intubated after undergoing a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for XRT (radiation therapy) to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Bilateral upper extremity edema - possible SVC syndrome: The patient's CT angiography indicates a patent superior vena cava, but clinically, she may have superior vena cava syndrome. This condition occurs when there is obstruction of blood flow through the superior vena cava, leading to swelling and fluid accumulation in the upper extremities.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass obstructing the left main and left lower lobe bronchi, as well as the right lower lobe bronchus. This obstruction is causing partial collapse of the left lower lobe and right lower lobe, along with bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Infection: The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. The patient is currently being treated with Unasyn D5/8 (ampicillin/sulbactam), which was previously receiving coverage with levofloxacin.

4. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She has been intubated and transferred to the ICU to begin radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways, leading to respiratory failure. The mass is obstructing several bronchi, resulting in partial collapse of the left lower lobe and right lower lobe. Bilateral pleural effusions are also present. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation and will continue to be on vent until there is improvement in tumor compression of the left main bronchus.

2. SVC syndrome: The patient exhibits bilateral upper extremity edema, which may indicate superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Although the computed tomography angiography (CTA) shows a patent SVC, clinically she may have SVC syndrome. The plan is to monitor the patient and use gentle diuresis with lasix to maintain a negative fluid balance of 500 cc.

3. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been falling from 33.8% to 28.6%. This could be due to dilutional hemolysis, blood loss, or other causes. Further evaluation is needed"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who has been admitted to the ICU for airway compromise caused by a large mediastinal mass. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and was intubated due to severe airway impingement. The plan is to provide XRT (radiation therapy) to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation.

The patient also has several other medical conditions and complications:

1. Bilateral upper extremity edema - suspected SVC syndrome: The patient has edema in both arms, which may be due to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. However, the CT angiogram indicates that the SVC is patent, suggesting that there might be another cause for the edema. The plan is to monitor the patient closely and use gentle diuresis with lasix.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by the mediastinal mass obstructing several bronchi and leading to partial collapse of the lungs. The patient has also been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. The treatment plan includes antibiotics (Unasyn D5/8), radiation therapy (XRT), and follow-up cultures.

3. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, which could be due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or anemia of chronic disease"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to a large mediastinal mass causing airway obstruction. The patient is undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and facilitate extubation. Other issues include bilateral upper extremity edema possibly due to superior vena cava syndrome, anemia with a decreasing hemoglobin level, atrial flutter likely caused by pericardial tumor involvement, wheezing likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, and hyperglycemia possibly related to steroid use. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is receiving appropriate medications and treatments for her conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass compressing the airways.
2. Superior vena cava syndrome leading to upper extremity edema and potential complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.
3. Anemia and hemoglobin drop potentially leading to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
4. Atrial flutter or other arrhythmias that could result in hemodynamic instability.
5. Hyperglycemia due to steroid use, which may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or other metabolic disturbances.
6. Infection from the prolonged use of invasive lines and devices.
7. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and malignancy."

   # metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.

 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - treat with Unasyn D6/8 (had received 4 days of levofloxacin coverage)

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and admitted to the ICU. She underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy to shrink a large mediastinal mass impinging on her airways. The goal is to successfully extubate the patient after treatment. The patient also has bilateral upper extremity edema, respiratory failure due to tumor compression of bronchi, anemia with a dropping HCT, atrial flutter, and hyperglycemia on decadron. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be indicative of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is a potential complication of the mediastinal mass compressing the SVC. This can lead to facial swelling, distended neck veins, and cyanosis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The tumor compression of the bronchi is causing respiratory failure. If not managed properly, this can lead to further deterioration in the patient's respiratory status and potentially result in cardiac arrest.
3. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient's falling HCT levels indicate anemia. If left untreated, it can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, resulting in fatigue, weakness, and potential organ damage.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient's history of atrial flutter increases the risk of recurrent arrhythmias. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to palpitations, reduced cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU for radiation therapy. The patient has been receiving chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The patient's main concerns include being extubated, having difficulty placing an arterial line, and experiencing bradycardia and hypotension while sleeping. The patient has allergies to no known medications and has received antibiotics in the past. The patient is currently on fentanyl and midazolam infusions. The patient's medical history remains unchanged, except for review of systems which is also unchanged from admission. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/74 to 80/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's weight is 65.2 kg, an increase from the admission weight of 60.1 kg. The patient has received a total of 3,006 mL of fluids, with 1,117 mL taken orally, 1,834 mL given intravenously, and a total output of 955 mL through urine and drains. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and SpO2 at 98%. The patient's ABG results show pH at 7.31, PaCO2 at 31 mmHg, and HCO3 at 19 mEq/L. The patient's blood work reveals a white blood cell count of 520 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 173 mg/dL, sodium level of 139 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 114 to 178 mg/dL. The patient's urinalysis shows proteinuria with 15.2 K/uL of protein. The patient's chest X-ray from 05/12/2104 at 03:34 AM shows no acute abnormalities. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating between 6.4 and 15.2 thousand cells/microliter. The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased from 31.7% on 05/12/2104 to 28.6% on 05/14/2104. The patient's platelet count has increased from 0.5 mg/dL on 05/12/2104 to 173 mg/dL on 05/17/2104. The patient's electrolyte levels are relatively stable, with sodium ranging from 135 to 145 mEq/L, potassium ranging from 3.4 to 4."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy for a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. The goal is to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass obstructing bronchi and causing partial lung collapse. She has also been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. The patient's hemoglobin levels are falling, and she is at risk for anemia and hct drop. She has experienced atrial flutter, which may be related to pericardial tumor involvement. The patient's asthma is secondary to tumor airway involvement, not bronchospasm. She is also experiencing hyperglycemia on decadron and has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may indicate superior vena cava syndrome (SVC syndrome). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 128/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. Her recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's current medications include Unasyn, f"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron)
   # metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT this AM
   - chemo initiation today
   - f/u CT torso for full staging
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - f/u IP recs (if any)
   - continue invasive ventilation

   # Bilateral upper extremity edema - ? SVC syndrome
 the CTA indicates
   patent SVC but clinically she may have it
   - monitor
   - gentle diuresis with lasix, goal negative 500 cc

   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - treat with Unasyn D6/8 (had received 4 days of levofloxacin coverage)
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass.
- She is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, which is attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by the mediastinal mass.
- The patient has a WBC elevation likely due to the addition of steroids (Decadron).
- She has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be related to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, although the CTA indicates a patent SVC.
- The patient's respiratory failure is also due to a 3-11 mediastinal mass obstructing the left main and left lower lobe bronchi, as well as the right lower lobe bronchus. There is also partial collapse of the left lower lobe and right lower lobe, along with bilateral pleural effusions.
- The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. She is being treated with Unasyn and will receive XRT as per the plan.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is dropping, possibly due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or other causes. Further evaluation is needed.
- The patient experienced atrial flutter, which reverted to normal sinus rhythm but is at high risk of recurrence. Rate control with diltiaz"

   medical condition, and answered all questions.  All understand nature
   of underlying disease.  All understand hope of reducing mediastinal
   tumor size with XRT and chemotherapy, to allow relief of extrinsic
   airway compression, and hope for possible extubation trial.  Although
   all hopeful, understand that patient may not be able to be extubated
   safely.  Express that patient would not want chronic ventilation via

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2104-5-17**] 20:43 ------
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, presenting with respiratory failure due to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression from a mediastinal mass. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chemotherapy has been initiated in hopes of reducing the tumor size and allowing airway compression release. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia - The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to mechanical ventilation and potential aspiration.
2. A-flutter - The patient has a history of pericardial involvement by the tumor, which can lead to atrial flutter. 
3. Anemia - The patient has anemia, which could be due to dilutional effects, bleeding, or acute critical response (ACD).
4. Hyperglycemia - The patient has hyperglycemia, which is likely attributed to the use of steroids (Decadron).
5. DVT - The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
6. Stress ulcers - The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and is receiving prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
7. VAP - The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and measures are being taken to prevent it, such as elevating the head of bed, mouth care, daily wake-up calls, and respiratory system batch interface"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Contineu XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing tumor size, allowing airways
   compression release and allow lungs to reexpand and hopefuly extubate.
   Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron)
   METATSTATIC MELENONMA -- Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial empirically.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed to pericardial invovlement by tumor.   at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   HYPERGLUYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, presenting with respiratory failure due to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by a mediastinal mass. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) have been initiated to reduce tumor size and alleviate airway compression. The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count attributed to the addition of steroids, pneumonia being treated empirically with antibiotics, anemia, asthma-like symptoms due to tumor involvement of the airways, atrial flutter secondary to pericardial involvement by the tumor, and hyperglycemia related to the use of decadron.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by the mediastinal mass. Continued mechanical ventilation and XRT are planned to reduce tumor size and allow for airway compression release, potentially leading to successful extubation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is being treated empirically with antibiotics. This condition needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent worsening of the respiratory status.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is dilutional, due to fluid administration, and possibly related to blood loss and acute critical event. Serial hct monitoring is recommended.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient experienced atrial flutter, likely secondary"

 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. The patient has been intubated and admitted to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. 

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass obstructing the airways, anemia/hct drop, atrial flutter, asthma-like wheezing secondary to tumor airway involvement, hyperglycemia on decadron, bilateral upper extremity edema possibly indicating superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), and bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening respiratory failure if the tumor continues to compress the airways, further decline in hemoglobin levels leading to severe anemia, recurrence of atrial flutter or development of new arrhythmias, exacerbation of hyperglycemia, worsening SVC syndrome, and potential infection due to the presence of bilateral pleural effusions.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly to ensure the patient's well-being and improve her clinical condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass causing obstruction of the left main and left lower lobe bronchi, as well as partial obstruction of the right lower lobe bronchus. This has resulted in left lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse. The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions.

2. Infection: The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella.

3. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient's hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit levels are dropping, which could be due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or other causes.

4. Atrial flutter: The patient has had episodes of atrial flutter, which may be related to pericardial tumor involvement. However, she has reverted to normal sinus rhythm and is at high risk of recurrence.

5. Wheezing: The patient is experiencing wheezing, which is most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Adjust diltiazem dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, experiencing respiratory failure due to airway obstruction caused by a mediastinal mass. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's medical history includes pneumonia, anemia (dilutional, bleed, ACD), and fluid balance monitoring due to fluid administration and ongoing losses. The patient is also experiencing A-flutter, which is attributed in part to pericardial involvement by the tumor. The patient's asthma symptoms are likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm.

The patient has hyperglycemia, which is attributed to the use of steroids (decadron). The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding.

The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, diltiazem, and antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient may require long-term mechanical ventilation, which carries risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-induced lung injury, and muscle weakness.
2. Tumor progression: The mediastinal mass causing airway compression may continue to grow and obstruct the airways, leading to further respiratory compromise.
3. Infection: The patient is already receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, and there"

   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 4th dose Monday [**5-19**]
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - treat with Unasyn D8/8 (had received 4 days of levofloxacin coverage)
 dc today
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.

   # Anemia/HCT drop
 falling from 33.8

25.7. Dilutional v
   hemolysis v bleed
   - trend HCT
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass.
- She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor.
- The patient's airways are severely impinged by the mediastinal mass, leading to respiratory failure.
- The mass obstructs the left main and lower lobe bronchi, as well as the right lower lobe bronchus, causing partial collapse of the left lower lobe and right lower lobe.
- The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella.
- She is currently on invasive ventilation and receiving Unasyn for infection.
- XRT has been planned for 10 doses, with the fourth dose scheduled on [**5-19**].
- Chemotherapy was initiated on [**5-16**] and will continue until the last dose on 4/11.
- The patient's hemoglobin levels are dropping, possibly due to dilutional hemolysis or bleed.
- She experienced atrial flutter, which reverted to normal sinus rhythm but carries a high risk of recurrence.
- The patient has wheezing likely caused by tumor airway involvement rather than asthma.
- She had hyperglycemia possibly related to steroid use, which has been discontinued.
- The patient may have SVC syndrome,"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression. She is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes pneumonia, anemia, and fluid management concerns.

Assessment and Plan:
1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Continue mechanical ventilation and XRT with chemotherapy to reduce mediastinal tumor size and alleviate extrinsic airways obstruction, aiming for extubation. Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT is complete.
2. WBC ELEVATION - Monitor due to addition of steroids (Decadron).
3. METASTATIC MELENOMA - Provide XRT to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation. No plan for stent placement.
4. PNEUMONIA - Continue antimicrobial therapy to complete the course.
5. ANEMIA - Continue serial hct, which is dilutional, bleed, and ACD.
6. FLUIDS - Monitor CVP and maintain balance.
7. A-FLUTTER - Attributed to pericardial involvement by tumor. Currently normal sinus rhythm, but at high risk of recurrence. Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem dose.
8. ASTHMA - Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they may exacerbate atrial"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. 

The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure due to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression from the mediastinal tumor. There is also a WBC elevation attributed to the addition of steroids, anemia (dilutional, bleed, ACD), pneumonia, asthma (wheezing secondary to tumor airway involvement), atrial flutter, hyperglycemia, and possible pericardial involvement by tumor.

The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. Antimicrobial therapy will be continued to complete the course for pneumonia. Anemia and fluid balance will be monitored, and atrial flutter will be managed with medications. Hyperglycemia will also be monitored and maintained below 150.

The patient's nutritional needs will be met through repletion with fiber, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP will be implemented. The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is ICU care. The patient is critically ill."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 4th dose Monday [**5-19**]
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She has been intubated and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure likely due to the mediastinal mass obstructing the left main and lower lobe bronchi, as well as right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, resulting in left lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse. The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions. She has been febrile during her admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella, for which she received an eight-day treatment with Levo/Unasyn.

The patient's other medical issues include anemia and a drop in hematocrit (HCT), atrial flutter, asthma (wheezing likely secondary to tumor airway involvement), hyperglycemia on decadron, and bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be due to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.

The plan for the patient includes continuing invasive ventilation, initiating XRT and chemotherapy, monitoring for clinical improvement, and considering repeat CT scans to monitor the progress of the mediastinal mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further spread of the mediastinal mass, development of new infections, complications from chemotherapy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass obstructing the left main and left lower lobe bronchi, as well as partial right lower lobe collapse. She has been febrile during her admission, and sputum cultures have grown Moraxella, which was treated with Levo/Unasyn for eight days. The patient's anemia and hematocrit drop are stable, and she is at high risk for atrial flutter recurrence. She also has wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, not bronchospasm. The patient has hyperglycemia on decadron, and her SVC syndrome may be clinically present despite a patent SVC on CTA. She is currently receiving invasive ventilation and is being monitored for various conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass obstructing airways.
2. Atrial flutter recurrence.
3. SVC syndrome.
4. Hyperglycemia.
5. Infection due to prolonged intubation.
6. Pressure ulcers from prolonged bedridden state.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent radiation therapy (XRT) and was intubated after a bronchoscopy. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by a large mediastinal mass obstructing the airways, leading to severe impingement. The plan is to provide XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

2. Atrial flutter: The patient experienced atrial flutter, which may be related to pericardial tumor involvement. It has reverted to normal sinus rhythm, but the patient is at high risk of recurrence. Rate control with diltiazem is being used.

3. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient has stable anemia and a dropping hematocrit (HCT) level. Trending HCT is planned.

4. Bilateral upper extremity edema: The patient may have superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, although a CTA indicates a patent SVC. Monitoring and checking CVP with consideration of diuresis is recommended.

5. Hyperglycemia on decadron: The patient has hyperglycemia, which is likely due to the use of decadron. Monitoring and managing blood glucose levels is important.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who presented with respiratory failure due to airway obstruction caused by a mediastinal mass. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The plan is to continue chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) in hopes of reducing the tumor size and allowing for extubation. The patient also has pneumonia, anemia, and fluid balance issues. Other medical complications include A-flutter, asthma (likely secondary to tumor involvement), hyperglycemia (possibly due to steroids), and asthma. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to airway compression caused by the mediastinal mass. Continued monitoring and mechanical ventilation will be necessary until the tumor size is reduced sufficiently to allow for extubation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, for which antibiotics have been prescribed. Completion of the antimicrobial course is important to treat the infection.
3. Anemia: The patient is experiencing anemia, which is likely due to dilutional effects, bleeding, and acute blood loss. Serial Hct monitoring will be necessary to manage the condition.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored, with the goal of maintaining a balance between inputs and outputs. This is particularly important given the patient's critical condition and potential"

The patient has several medical conditions, including pneumonia, anemia, dilutional anemia, acute flutter, asthma, hyperglycemia, and asthma. She is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, steroids, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Fluid balance and nutritional support are being monitored, with plans to maintain a balance and provide appropriate nutrition. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU. The attending physician was present during key portions of the patient's care and agrees with the resident's assessment and plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to airway obstruction due to the mediastinal mass. Mechanical ventilation will continue to be provided until the tumor size decreases sufficiently to allow for extubation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   Consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Stable Hct.  Continue serial Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, presenting with respiratory failure primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by a mediastinal mass. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. A trial of spontaneous breathing test (SBT) yesterday was complicated by supraventricular tachycardia, which required administration of diltiazem.

The patient remains critically ill, with ongoing respiratory support. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and administer chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) in hopes of reducing the size of the mediastinal tumor and alleviate airway obstruction. Bronchoscopy has been considered to assess airway patency.

The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, possibly due to the addition of steroids (Decadron). Anemia is present but considered stable, and the patient's fluids should be monitored to maintain a balance.

The patient has experienced episodes of tachycardia and atrial flutter, both attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor. Anxiety has also been present but has resolved. The patient is at high risk for recurrence of atrial flutter.

Wheezing is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than asthma, and bronchodilators are avoided due to the risk of exacerbating atrial fibrillation.

Hyperglycemia is attributed to the use of decadron, and glucose levels should be monitored and maintained below 150"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   Consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Stable Hct.  Continue serial Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, presenting with respiratory failure due to airway compression from a mediastinal mass.
- The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. A trial of spontaneous breathing test (SBT) yesterday was complicated by supraventricular tachycardia, which required administration of diltiazem.
- The patient has been receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) to reduce the size of the mediastinal tumor and alleviate airway obstruction.
- The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to the addition of steroids (Decadron). Monitoring is recommended.
- The patient has anemia, which is attributed to acute blood loss. The hemoglobin level is stable, and serial hemoglobin monitoring is advised.
- Fluid balance needs to be closely monitored to maintain a balance between inputs and outputs.
- The patient experienced tachycardia, which was attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor. Anxiety also contributed to the elevated heart rate, but it has since resolved.
- The patient has atrial flutter, which is attributed to local atrial irritation caused by the tumor. Medications are being used to control the heart rate.
- Wheezing is present but is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than asthma. Bronchodilators may exacerbate atrial fibrillation, so they are being avoided.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, presenting with respiratory failure attributed to airway obstruction caused by a mediastinal mass. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. A trial of spontaneous breathing test (SBT) was attempted yesterday but was complicated by supraventricular tachycardia, which required administration of diltiazem.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate ranging from 69-174 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65-102/40-54 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 0-27 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 280,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 116 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose level of 178 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The primary cause of respiratory failure is airway obstruction due to the mediastinal mass. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and administer radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy in hopes of reducing the tumor size and alleviating the extrinsic compression on the airways, eventually allowing for extubation. A repeat CT scan will be done when XRT is complete, and a bronchoscopy may be considered to assess airway patency.

2. WBC Elevation: The elevated white blood cell count is attributed to the addition of steroids (Decadron). Monitoring is advised.

3. Metastatic Melanoma: The mediastinal mass pathology has been confirmed as melanoma, causing severe extrinsic compression of the airways. The goal of treatment is to provide XRT to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. No plan for stent placement has been discussed.

4. Pneumonia: Continue antimicrobial therapy to complete the course.

5. Anemia: The patient is anemic with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL. The cause is attributed to acute blood loss. The patient's Hct is stable, and serial Hct monitoring will be continued.

6. Fluids: Monitor central venous pressure (CVP) and maintain a balance between fluid intake and output.

7. A-Flutter: The patient is at high risk for recurrent atrial flutter"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 7th dose today
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   .
   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, who presented with a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. The patient was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and facilitate extubation. The patient has received 6 doses of XRT and the 7th dose was administered today. Chemotherapy was initiated on 05/16 and the last dose was on 04/11. The patient continues to require invasive ventilation.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by a likely mediastinal mass causing obstruction of the left main and lower lobe bronchi, as well as partial obstruction of the right lower lobe bronchus. This has resulted in bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown Moraxella, which was treated with Levofloxacin and Unasyn.

The patient's blood work shows anemia and a drop in hemoglobin concentration. The patient also had atrial flutter, which reverted to normal sinus rhythm but remains at high risk for recurrence. Rate control with diltiazem is being used, and the threshold heart rate is set at 90 bpm. The patient's asthma is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, and bronchodilators are being avoided due to the risk of exacerbating atrial"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   Consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Stable Hct.  Continue serial Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. She remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to an extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, anemia, and hyperglycemia. Other conditions include metastatic melanoma, asthma, atrial flutter, and possible stress ulcers. The patient's current treatment plan involves continuing mechanical ventilation, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy to reduce the tumor size and alleviate airway obstruction. Monitoring and close observation are essential for the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to airway obstruction caused by the mediastinal mass. Continued monitoring and mechanical ventilation will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which requires completion of the antimicrobial course to prevent complications such as sepsis or worsening respiratory status.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may contribute to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue perfusion. Serial Hct monitoring and appropriate management will be required.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, likely secondary to steroid use. Close monitoring and maintenance of blood glucose levels below 150 mg/dL will be necessary to prevent complications.
5. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, presenting with respiratory failure due to airway compression by a mediastinal mass.
- She remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.
- The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, attributed to the addition of steroids.
- Other medical conditions include pneumonia, anemia, fluids balance, tachycardia, A-flutter, asthma, hyperglycemia, and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by a mediastinal mass. This can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and subsequent respiratory acidosis.

2. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for pneumonia, which may complicate if not properly managed with appropriate antibiotics.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which could worsen if there is ongoing blood loss or if the underlying cause is not addressed.

4. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent complications such as fluid overload or dehydration.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor. If not managed appropriately, it can increase the risk of arrhythmias and cardiac complications.

6. A-flutter: The patient has a history of A-flutter, which may be exacerbated"

   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 7th dose today
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.

 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She has been intubated and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, anemia/hct drop, atrial flutter, asthma, hyperglycemia on decadron, bilateral upper extremity edema, and possible superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/54 mmHg to 121/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 63.9 kg, and her height is 60 inches.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.7%, platelet count of 311 K/uL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 96 mg/dL to 175 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances including low potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and magnesium (Mg++) levels.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation in the assist/control mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular assessment due to the presence of endotracheal tubes in the radial and dorsal pedal pulses. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing invasive ventilation, initiating radiation therapy, administering chemotherapy, monitoring for respiratory improvement, switching to pressure support, considering a repeat CT scan to monitor tumor progression, and ruling out atrial flutter recurrence.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include worsening respiratory failure due to further obstruction of airways by the mediastinal mass, development of additional pulmonary infections, exacerbation of anemia and hct drop leading to further compromise in oxygen carrying capacity, recurrence of atrial flutter or development of new cardiac arrhythmias, worsening hyperglycemia, and progression of SVC syndrome."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy yesterday disclosed evidence for
   airway patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not
   evaluated.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size, allowing
   reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work towards
   extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression. The patient is currently in the ICU and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 113/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation management.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has significant airway obstruction due to the mediastinal mass, leading to respiratory failure. Bronchoscopy revealed evidence of airway patency in the right and left mainstems, but the trachea was not evaluated. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and provide XRT (radiation therapy) and chemotherapy to reduce the tumor size and alleviate the extrinsic airways obstruction, with the hope of eventually extubating the patient.

2. WBC Elevation: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which was partially attributed to the addition of steroids (Decadron). The WBC count has resolved, and the patient will be monitored.

3. Metastatic Melanoma: The mediastinal mass pathology is confirmed as melanoma, causing"

   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy yesterday disclosed evidence for
   airway patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not
   evaluated.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size, allowing
   reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work towards
   extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a current critical condition. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure caused by airway obstruction and extrinsic compression from a mediastinal mass. 

The patient's medical history includes extensive mediastinal mass with central airway compression, pneumonia, anemia, and asthma. The pneumonia is being treated with antibiotics, and the patient's white blood cell count has been elevated but has since resolved. The anemia is likely related to chemotherapy treatment, and the patient's hemoglobin levels are falling. 

The patient also has a history of metastatic melanoma, which has caused severe extrinsic compression of the airways. The plan is to provide XRT (radiation therapy) to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. 

Other complications include tachycardia and atrial flutter, both of which are attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor. The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored, and there are plans to maintain a balance between intake and output. 

Hyperglycemia has been observed and is likely related to the use of steroids. The patient's blood glucose levels need to be monitored and maintained below 150. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism. The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, presenting with respiratory failure primarily attributed to airway obstruction caused by an extensive mediastinal mass. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. 

The patient's medical history includes extensive mediastinal mass with central airway compression, for which chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) have been initiated to reduce the tumor size and alleviate extrinsic airway obstruction. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation until the tumor size decreases sufficiently to allow for extubation.

The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count, which was initially attributed to the addition of steroids but has since resolved. There is a history of metastatic melanoma, which has caused severe extrinsic compression of the airways. The treatment plan includes XRT to shrink the tumor and potentially allow for successful extubation. No plan for stent placement has been discussed.

The patient is being treated for pneumonia with antibiotics, and there is evidence of anemia, likely related to chemotherapy. The patient's fluids are being monitored to maintain a balance, and tachycardia is attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor. Anxiety provoked by the situation has been resolved.

The patient is at high risk for recurrent atrial flutter, which may be related to pericardial involvement by the tumor. Enzymes have ruled out other causes, and the current lower dose of diltiazem is being used to control"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She has been intubated after undergoing a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation.

The patient experienced an unplanned extubation at 01:00 PM on 05/23/2104, which resulted in respiratory distress. She was then re-intubated, and it was confirmed with the patient and her family that she would want this even if it was unlikely she would ever successfully come off the ventilator.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), a heart rate of 83 bpm (with a range of 68-137 bpm), a blood pressure of 98/49 mmHg (with a range of 60-141/73 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute (with a range of 11-23 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a range of 6.5-14.2 thousand/mm3, a decreased hemoglobin level of 8"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and was transferred to the hospital for radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the mediastinal mass impinging on her airways. 

The patient has experienced several medical complications during her stay. These include respiratory failure likely caused by the mediastinal mass obstructing the left main and lower lobe bronchi, as well as the right lower lobe bronchus. The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions. 

The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. She has received an eight-day treatment with Levo/Unasyn.

The patient's anemia and HCT drop are stable, but close monitoring is required. The patient was previously in atrial flutter, which reverted to normal sinus rhythm but is at high risk of recurrence. Anticoagulation may be considered, but the patient's expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed need to be taken into account.

The patient's wheezing is most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm. Bronchodilators are avoided as they may exacerbate atrial flutter.

The patient has hyperglycemia, which is likely due to decadron. Monitoring is recommended, and the last dose"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, should get 9th dose today (touch base with rad
   onc), consider trach for the patient.
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation, will try to extubate soon
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - gental bolus
 watch in and out, A Line may be considered.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   .
   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]
   .
   # Bilateral upper extremity edema - ? SVC syndrome
 the CTA indicates
   patent SVC but clinically she may have it
   - monitor edema, I/Os

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. The patient was intubated after experiencing respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass obstructing the left main and lower lobe bronchi, as well as partial obstruction of the right lower lobe bronchus. This obstruction has also led to bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. The patient received an eight-day treatment with Levo/Unasyn. The plan is to provide external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. There is no plan for stent placement.

The patient's anemia and HCT drop are stable, and they are monitoring the trend in HCT and performing guaiac stool tests. The patient had atrial flutter, which has since reverted to normal sinus rhythm, but there is a high risk of recurrence. Rate control with diltiazem is being used, and the threshold HR is set at 90. The patient is also being monitored for gentle bolus and potential need for an A-line.

The patient's wheezing is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm. Bronchodilators are being avoided as they may exacerbate atrial flutter.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, should get 9th dose today (touch base with rad
   onc), consider trach for the patient.
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation, will try to extubate soon
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.

 Stable.

   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined Mrs [**Known lastname 11723**] and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided in her care.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7709**]
s note
   above and largely agree with his findings and plan of care.  I would
   add the following.  The patient has a most impressive chest CT scan,
   with a huge mediastinal mass, biopsy confirmed to be metstatic
   melanoma, compressing the left atrium and pulmonary veins, totally
   occluding her left mainstem, and very severely narrowing all her right
   sided airways as well.  Her exam today is consistent with severe airway
   narrowing and very prolonged expiratory times and loud rhonchi.
   Without very significant improvement in CT/bronch findings with
   completion of XRT, I do not see how she can be reasonably considered a
   candidate for extubation. Given the overall prognosis, our primary goal
   should be to avoid the extreme discomfort of asphyxiation.  For the
   time being I would continue to treat aggressively, even adding abx if
   febrile or leukocytotic.  However if repeat CT or bronch is not much
   better, I would personally advise CMO while still in ICU and on vent
   and initiate terminal wean. Thus right now SBT
s and consideration of
   trache are, for me, are not being considered.  I understand Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   had spoken with family, and I stand ready to do so also over the next
   couple of days.  Right now, fortunately, the patient is quite
   comfortable on the vent.
   45min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on the airways. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU to begin XRT (radiation therapy) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation. The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown Moraxella, which was treated with Levo/Unasyn. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass obstructing the left main and lower lobe bronchi, as well as partial right lower lobe collapse. She has bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's anemia and HCT drop are stable, and she had atrial flutter but reverted to normal sinus rhythm. Her asthma is wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, not bronchospasm. She also has hyperglycemia on decadron and may have SVC syndrome. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, and it is planned to try to extubate her soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass obstructing the airways.
2. Infection (Moraxella) as indicated by fever and positive sputum cultures.
3. Anemia and HCT drop.
4. Atrial flutter or recurrence of arrhythmias.
5. Hyperglycemia.
6. SVC syndrome.
7. Potential need for tracheostomy due to prolonged intubation.
8. Difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation.
9. Risk of pneumonia due to prolonged intubation and immobilization.
10. Potential complications from chemotherapy and radiation therapy."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, presenting with severe airway obstruction caused by a large mediastinal mass. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and facilitate extubation. The patient has respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass obstructing bronchi and resulting in left and right lobe collapse and bilateral pleural effusions. She has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures grew Moraxella, which was treated with antibiotics. The patient's anemia and hematocrit levels are stable, but she remains at risk for recurrence of atrial flutter, which was temporarily resolved. The patient also has wheezing likely due to tumor airway involvement, hyperglycemia, and bilateral upper extremity edema potentially indicating superior vena cava syndrome. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and she is receiving appropriate ICU care including invasive ventilation, nutrition, and prophylaxis measures. The plan is to continue XRT and chemotherapy, reassess with a repeat CT scan, and discuss terminal extubation if there is no improvement."

   yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses,
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - CT today to eval interval change
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
 if no improvement on CT, discuss with
   family/pt terminal extubation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
 if no improvement on CT, discuss with family/pt terminal
   extubation
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - gental bolus
 watch in and out, A Line may be considered.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who presented to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation due to severe airway obstruction caused by a mediastinal mass. The mass has also led to left main and left lower lobe bronchi obstruction, right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and partial collapse of the left lower lobe and right lower lobe. The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. The patient has received treatment with Levo/Unasyn and will undergo radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the tumor and facilitate extubation. Other conditions include anemia, atrial flutter, asthma, hyperglycemia, and bilateral upper extremity edema. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the large mediastinal mass causing severe airway obstruction. If the mass does not improve or worsens, there is a risk of continued respiratory failure leading to terminal extubation.
2. Infection: The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. There is a potential risk of developing a hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged int"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by a large mediastinal mass. The mass is obstructing the left main and lower lobe bronchi, as well as the right lower lobe bronchus, leading to partial collapse of the left lower lobe and right lower lobe. The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions. She has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown Moraxella. She is currently receiving invasive ventilation and has been initiated on chemotherapy with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. A repeat CT scan has been ordered to evaluate the interval change. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the large mediastinal mass causing obstruction of the airways. This could lead to further deterioration in respiratory function if the tumor does not respond to treatment.
2. Infection: The patient has been febrile during admission and has a positive culture for Moraxella. This indicates a potential infection, which may require additional antibiotics and monitoring for signs of sepsis.
3. SVC syndrome: The patient presents with bilateral upper extremity edema, which raises the suspicion of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. This condition occurs when there is obstruction of the SVC, often caused by a tumor. It"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined Mrs [**Known lastname 11723**] and I was present for the key
   portion of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note
   above and largely agree with his findings and plan of care.  The
   patient had an episode of agitation last night that threatened another
   self extubation. Hence she is more significantly  sedated and
   comfortable on the vent today. Exam still has prolonged exhalation
   phase and diffuse rhonchi.   As per my note yesterday, I believe we
   need to await her 2 remaining XRT treatments and then re image with CT
   (not on PEEP or just a small amount
 such as PSV 5/0).  Repeat bronch
   may also be necessary.  If no major improvement in large airway caliber
   is seen (on no or low level vent support) then CMO strategy would be
   clearly needed.  For now I would keep her relatively heavily sedated
   and minimize interventions for now.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to severe airway impingement caused by a large mediastinal mass. The mass is obstructing multiple bronchi and leading to atelectasis and pleural effusions. The patient also has a history of wheezing, which is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement.

2. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient has stable anemia and a decreased hematocrit (HCT). This may require close monitoring and potential transfusion to maintain a target HCT of greater than 23%.

3. Atrial flutter: The patient had an episode of atrial flutter, which may be related to pericardial tumor involvement. There is a high risk of recurrence, and rate control with diltiazem is recommended. The use of anticoagulation is unclear in this case due to the patient's expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity for bleeding.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, possibly related to steroid use (decadron). Monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary, and consideration should be given to adjusting insulin or other medications as needed.

5. Bilateral upper extremity edema: The patient exhibits bilateral upper extremity edema, which could be indicative of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome."

   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.

   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23

   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who has been admitted to the ICU. She is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by a large mediastinal mass obstructing her airways. The mass was pathologically confirmed to be melanoma. The patient's plan includes receiving XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass, which is obstructing the left main and left lower lobe bronchi, as well as the right lower lobe bronchus. There is also partial collapse of the left lower lobe and right lower lobe, along with bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown Moraxella. Treatment with antibiotics has been initiated.

The patient's anemia and HCT drop are stable, and she is being monitored with guaiac stool and transfusion goals to maintain HCT >23. The patient had atrial flutter, which has reverted to normal sinus rhythm, but she is at high risk for recurrence. Rate control with diltiazem is being used, and anticoagulation is under consideration.

The patient also has wheezing, which is most likely due to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm. Asthma medication is being avoided to prevent exacerbating atrial flutter"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 95/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her weight has increased from 60.1 kg at admission to 69.8 kg currently. 

The patient has received eight days of treatment for a Moraxella infection and is now sputum positive. She has been on fentanyl and midazolam infusions. 

Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including metastatic melanoma with a mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on the airways, respiratory failure likely due to the mediastinal mass, anemia/hematocrit drop, atrial flutter (which reverted to normal sinus rhythm), and asthma (wheezing secondary to tumor airway involvement). 

The plan is to provide XRT and chemotherapy, monitor"

   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient

","The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She was admitted for bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU to begin radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy for tumor shrinkage prior to extubation. The patient had respiratory failure likely due to the mediastinal mass and was febrile during admission. Sputum culture grew Moraxella, and she received an eight-day treatment with Levo/Unasyn. She previously failed extubation and was reintubated. She is currently on pressure support and is planned for daily spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). If there is no successful movement towards extubation, a tracheostomy may be considered.

The patient has anemia and a dropping hematocrit (HCT) level. Trend HCT and guaiac stool are recommended. The goal is to maintain HCT above 23%. The patient also had atrial flutter, which reverted back to normal sinus rhythm but is at high risk of recurrence. Rate control with diltiazem is being used, with a threshold heart rate (HR) of 90. The patient has wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, not bronchospasm. Bronchodilators are avoided as they may exacerbate atrial flutter.

   need to await her 2 remaining XRT treatments and then re image with CT
   (not on PEEP or just a small amount
 such as PSV 5/0).  Repeat bronch
   may also be necessary.  If no major improvement in large airway caliber
   is seen (on no or low level vent support) then CMO strategy would be
   clearly needed.  For now I would keep her relatively heavily sedated
   and minimize interventions for now.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with metastatic melanoma and lung metastases, resulting in tumor compression of the left atrium. They have experienced recurrent aflutter and are currently intubated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs indicate a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and adequate oxygen saturation. The patient's weight has increased from 60.1 kg at admission to 69.8 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,303 mL and output of 925 mL, with a positive balance of 1,378 mL. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation, respectively. Other ICU medications are also being administered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's prolonged exhalation phase and diffuse rhonchi suggest possible respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ventilator settings and respiratory function is necessary.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient's agitation and potential for self-extubation indicate delirium or confusion. Adequate sedation and pain control should be maintained.
3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient's elevated temperature may be indicative of an underlying infection or other causes. Further investigation is required to determine the cause of the fever.
4. Atrial flutter: The patient's recurrent aflutter needs to be monitored, and appropriate cardiac management should be implemented to maintain stable heart rhythm.
5. Ineffective"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated,
   continue at current settings
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
   - if no successful movement toward extubation after completing XRT
   treatments, will have to consider terminal extubation vs. trach with
   d/c to hospice.  Will discuss with family today and consider palliative
   care consult after meeting.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. The patient was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to another hospital unit to begin radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure likely due to the mediastinal mass, anemia/hct drop, atrial flutter, and asthma. The respiratory failure is being managed with continued mechanical ventilation at current settings, pressure support, repeat CT scan to monitor the progress of the mediastinal mass, and consideration for terminal extubation versus tracheostomy with discharge to hospice if there is no successful movement toward extubation after completing XRT treatments.

The anemia/hct drop is being monitored with trend HCT and guaiac stool, aiming for a transfusion goal hct >23. The atrial flutter is believed to be due to pericardial tumor involvement but has reverted to normal sinus rhythm temporarily. Rate control is being achieved with diltiazem, with a threshold HR of 90. The asthma is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement and is not due to bronchospasm, so bronchodilators are being avoided.

Electrolytes are replete, and the patient has no IV fluids. Prophylactic measures"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following

   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated,
   continue at current settings
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
   - if no successful movement toward extubation after completing XRT
   treatments, will have to consider terminal extubation vs. trach with
   d/c to hospice.  Will discuss with family today and consider palliative
   care consult after meeting.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.

 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

She was intubated after undergoing a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation. The patient had been febrile during her admission and sputum culture grew Moraxella, which was treated with Levo/Unasyn for eight days.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe airway impingement caused by a large mediastinal mass. The patient underwent an unsuccessful extubation attempt earlier in her hospital course and required reintubation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range. The assessment and plan indicate that the mediastinal mass is causing severe impingement on the patient's airways, leading to respiratory failure. The plan is to provide X-ray therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation. 

The patient has been treated with antibiotics for a Moraxella infection and has received eight days of treatment with Levo/Unasyn. She is currently receiving pressure support during spontaneous breathing trials as tolerated. A repeat CT scan is planned to monitor the progress of the mediastinal mass. If there is no successful movement toward extubation, the option of tracheostomy will be considered. 

Other issues addressed in the note include anemia, atrial"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
   - if no successful movement toward extubation, will have to consider
   trach
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to a large mediastinal mass. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and was intubated. She has received XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and facilitate successful extubation. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,332 mL and output of 850 mL, with a positive balance of 1,482 mL. The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values, including creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, are within normal limits. 

The patient's medical history includes metastatic melanoma with a mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma. The plan is to continue with XRT and chemotherapy to reduce the size of the tumor. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the large mediastinal mass impinging on the airways. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy disclosed evidence for airway
   patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not evaluated,
   but failed self-extubation trial.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Continue XRT to completion (final session #10 tomorrow).  Monitor
   repeat CT scan when XRT complete.  If no significant change in thoracic
   CT and no further treatment planned, will consider extubation (no
   trach) as per discussion with husband.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 LLL pneuonian, and now RUL infiltrate.  Continue
   antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently experiencing respiratory failure primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by a mediastinal mass. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. The plan is to complete radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation. Other medical conditions include WBC elevation, pneumonia with infiltrates in the left lower lobe (LLL) and right upper lobe (RUL), anemia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by the mediastinal mass. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the tumor continues to compress the airways or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia with infiltrates in the LLL and RUL. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia and potential spread to other areas of the lungs.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to chemotherapy treatment. There is a risk of further decline in hemoglobin levels and potential complications related to decreased oxygen carrying capacity.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, likely attributed to the use of steroids (Decadron). There is a risk of uncontrolled hyperglycemia leading to diabetic ketoacidosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. The patient has been intubated after undergoing a bronchoscopy. She was transferred to the ICU to begin radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently for successful extubation. The patient has received 9 doses of XRT so far.

The patient's respiratory status is critical as she is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass. She has been febrile during her admission, and sputum culture grew Moraxella, for which she has been treated with antibiotics. The patient's current ventilator settings include a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. She is also on pressure support.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable, and she is being monitored for any signs of anemia. Her atrial flutter is likely secondary to pericardial tumor involvement, but she has reverted to normal sinus rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy disclosed evidence for airway
   patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not evaluated,
   but failed self-extubation trial.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Continue XRT to completion (final session #10 tomorrow).  XRT comlete.
   Await final read on repeat Chest CT today.  If no significant change in
   thoracic CT and no further treatment planned, will consider extubation
   (no trach) as per discussion with husband.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 LLL pneuonian, and now RUL infiltrate.  Continue
   antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient continues to experience episodes of tachycardia, which is being managed with intravenous diltiazem.

The patient has a history of metastatic melanoma with extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed evidence of airway patency in the right and left mainstem bronchi. However, the trachea was not evaluated, and the patient attempted self-extubation, which failed.

The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and complete radiation therapy (XRT). The goal of XRT is to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. There are no plans for stent placement. The patient also has pneumonia with infiltrates in the left lower lobe (LLL) and right upper lobe (RUL), and antibiotics will be continued to complete the course.

The patient has anemia, which is attributed to chemotherapy. Monitoring stool guaiac will be done, and serial hematocrit (Hct) will be monitored. Fluid balance will be monitored, and the plan is to maintain balance. Tachycardia is attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor, and anxiety provoked by the situation has been resolved. Atrial flutter is also present, likely due to pericardial involvement by the tumor. Enzymes have been ruled out"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and an extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression. She remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression. Bronchoscopy revealed evidence of airway patency in the right and left mainstem, but the trachea was not evaluated. The patient attempted self-extubation but failed. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and await further treatment planning, including a repeat Chest CT. If there is no significant change in the thoracic CT and no further treatment planned, extubation without tracheostomy may be considered.

The patient also has a WBC elevation, which has resolved. This was partially attributed to the addition of steroids (Decadron). The patient has metastatic melanoma with a mediastinal mass pathology causing severe extrinsic compression of airways. The plan is to provide radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation. There are no plans for stent placement, according to the IP.

Additionally, the patient has pneumonia with left lower lobe (LLL) and right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrates. Antibiotics will be continued to complete the course. The patient is anemic and has a falling hematocrit (Hct), which may be related to chemotherapy"

   CT chest:
   1)Interval development of patchy consolidation in the right upper and

   middle lobe is most likely due to radiotherapy and a small right
   pleural
   effusion is now moderately large, the left pleural effusion has
   slightly
   increased and remains small.
   2)Slight improvement in the right main and left mainstem bronchial
   narrowing
   which remains severe.
   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   Now s/p chemo/XRT with little improvement as assessed clinically and on
   CT imaging.
   - completed XRT course (10 treatments)
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - goals of care discussion with Oncology and family of patient to
   determine plan of action.  Options include tracheostomy, terminal wean,
   or terminal extubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn.
   - continues to require intubation.  See above re: plan.
   - will image R pleural effusion with bedside u/s and consider
   therapeutic thoracentesis prior to extubation (plan for Sunday or
   Monday) to optimize respiratory status off vent
   - start steroids for underlying pneumonitis
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Slowly downtrending.  Today Hct < 21.
   - transfuse 1u pRBC
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem 30 mg QID, threshold HR 90
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, which has led to a large mediastinal mass.
- The patient was intubated after undergoing bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and was transferred to the ICU to begin radiation therapy (XRT).
- The patient completed an XRT course of 10 treatments and started chemotherapy on [**5-16**], with the last dose given on 4/11.
- There has been little improvement clinically and on CT imaging.
- A discussion about the patient's goals of care was held with the oncology team and the family to determine the plan of action. Options include tracheostomy, terminal wean, or terminal extubation.
- The patient is still requiring intubation and is febrile during admission. Sputum culture grew Moraxella, and the patient has been treated with antibiotics for eight days.
- The patient continues to have respiratory failure, likely due to the mediastinal mass. The left lung is more affected than the right.
- The patient has anemia and a dropping hematocrit level. A transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBC) is recommended.
- The patient had atrial flutter but reverted back to normal sinus rhythm. The cause is suspected to be pericardial tumor involvement."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. The patient has been intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT). She has completed her XRT course and received chemotherapy, but there has been little improvement clinically or on CT imaging.

The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum culture grew Moraxella, for which she was treated with antibiotics. She continues to require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The plan is to image the right pleural effusion with bedside ultrasound and consider therapeutic thoracentesis prior to extubation to optimize respiratory status off the ventilator. Steroids have been started for underlying pneumonitis.

The patient has anemia and a low hematocrit level, which is slowly downtrending. Transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells has been ordered, along with monitoring of the hematocrit trend and guaiac stool.

The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which is likely due to pericardial tumor involvement. She has reverted to normal sinus rhythm but is at high risk of recurrence. Rate control with diltiazem has been initiated, with a threshold heart rate of 90 beats per minute.

The patient also has wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, not bronchospasm. Bronchodilators are being avoided to"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Completed XRT
   (#10) XRT.  No significant change in tumor burden.  Awaiting further
   Oncology evaluation, to determine if any additional interventions are
   available for treatment of melanoma.  If no treatment options, will
   consider extubation (no trach) as per discussion with husband.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 LLL pneumonia, and now RUL infiltrate.  Continue
   antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to airway compression from a mediastinal mass. She is intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a WBC elevation likely due to the addition of steroids. She also has pneumonia with infiltrates in the left lower lobe and right upper lobe, anemia possibly related to chemotherapy, and tachycardia attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor. Other findings include asthma-like wheezing secondary to tumor airway involvement, hyperglycemia possibly due to the use of decadron, and a history of metastatic melanoma with extensive mediastinal mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by the mediastinal mass. This poses a significant risk as it can lead to hypoxemia and subsequent organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia with infiltrates in both the left lower lobe and right upper lobe. This increases the risk of worsening respiratory status and potential sepsis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to chemotherapy treatment. It can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and may result in fatigue, weakness, and increased susceptibility to infections.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia"
