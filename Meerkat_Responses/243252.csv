   Assessment and Plan
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,

 MALARIA
   .
   Assessment and Plan:
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria is evaluated for altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status, suspected cerebral malaria - Patient had
   questionable seizure and remains altered. She does not have a known
   seizure disorder. Current confusional state may reflect post-ictal
   status or, less likely, nonconvulsive status. I am most concerned for
   an underlying CNS infection.
   .
   Bacterial meningitis seems less likely in the face of an unremarkable
   CSF wbc count, protein, and glucose. Her elevated CSF RBC count raises
   the question of herpes encephalitis - however would expect elevated
   protein with CNS herpes; suspect RBCs are [**12-22**] to traumatic OSH spinal
   tap.
   .
   She is not known to be HIV positive - though this needs to be
   clarified.
   .
   Among other noninfectious causes of her confusion, consider also toxic
   ingestion though less likely with her negative tox screens. Her basic
   metabolic panel here is notable only for mild hyperglycemia and an
   anion gap (see below). Head CT shows no evidence of bleed or mass
   lesion to account for her symptoms.
   .
   - Intubate for airway protection
   - Empiric IV quinidine. Consider discussing with CDC regarding
   artemesinin availability.
   - Will continue acyclovir for now pending HSV PCR though think less
   likely
   - Continue ceftriaxone 2g daily given increased risk of GNR infection
   in this setting
   - Continuous EKG monitoring while on quinidine
   - Follow fingerstick q4h
   - Follow parasite smears daily
   - Given concern for CNS malaria will discuss exchange transfusion with
   bloodbank
   - HIV
   - EEG
   - Add on Ca/Mag/Phos
   - Consider MRI head
   - Seizure precautions
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Consider neurology consult
   .
   * Fever
   Fevers are most likely due to malaria, as above. Other considerations
   includ aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia given her altered mental
   status; however her CXR does not show any infiltrate. She has mild
   pyuria on her UA - ?whether her reported right flank pain may have been
   [**12-22**] pyelonephritis. No diarrhea or abdominal tenderness worrisome for
   an infectious GI process.
   - Malaria empiric treatment as above
   - Continuing ceftriaxone as above
   - Follow up pending blood cultures, add on urine culture
   - Call OSH for pending micro results
   - Obtain further records regarding treatment and workup from [**Hospital1 958**]
   .
   * Gap acidosis
   Malaria could cause acidosis. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to starvation ketosis given
   urine ketones. Not hyperglycemic to suggest DKA. Lactate is within
   normal limits. Ingestion a consideration but less likely with negative
   urine and serum tox screens.
   - Repeat electrolytes
   - Add on Osms
   - Check ABG
   .
   * Anemia
   Baseline Hct uncertain. With question of malaria hemolysis is obviously
   a concern - however patient's total bilirubin is within normal limits.
   No report of bleeding. INR only minimally elevated - think DIC is less
   likely.
   - Add on haptoglobin/LDH, fibrinogen, check peripheral smear
   - Follow CBC and coags [**Hospital1 **], maintain T+S, transfuse Hct>25
   .
   * Domestic abuse
   - Social work consult
   - Screen visitors

   [**Name (NI) 156**] status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a recent history of falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. The patient had questionable seizure activity and remains unresponsive. The initial CT head showed no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction. The impression was no evidence of cerebral edema or other findings to suggest cerebral malaria on this unenhanced CT examination. However, the second CT head revealed no acute intracranial abnormality and no specific evidence for cerebral edema.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, mildly elevated glucose levels, and an anion gap metabolic acidosis. The CSF analysis shows an elevated protein level and a moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis without significant neutrophilic pleocytosis or red blood cell count. Cryptococcal antigen was negative.

The patient has been diagnosed with malaria and is being treated with empiric IV quinidine. Acyclovir has been continued for now pending HSV PCR results. Ceftriaxone has also been continued due to the increased risk of GNR infection in this setting. Continuous EKG monitoring is being done while on quinidine, and fingerstick glucose levels are being checked every four hours. Parasite smears will be followed daily, and an exchange transfusion is being considered. HIV status is pending clarification.

   .
   Assessment and Plan:
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 Pt continues to be unresponsive, even when
   off propofol. Currently, suspected cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P.
   falciparum malaria. However, other causes must be considered. Patient
   had questionable seizure although no known seizure disorder and remains
   altered. Current confusional state may reflect post-ictal status or,
   less likely, nonconvulsive status. EEG performed today. LP performed
   does not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status
   unknown although pt negative 2 y ago per friends.  Toxic ingestion less
   likely as tox screens negative (Benzo
s positive most likely b/c pt
   received ativan for ?seizure). Head CT shows no evidence of bleed or
   mass lesion to account for her symptoms. MRI pending. Pt intubated
   yesterday for airway protection.  She received plasma exchange
   transfusion yesterday to decrease parasitemia. Last smear negative.
   -Appreciate ID and neuro recs- will f/u
   -Continue IV quinidine. If pt has s/e, call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8534**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8535**] (ID)- CDC
   papers for artemesinin are in back of pt
s chart.
   - Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR
 f/u at [**Hospital1 958**] and [**Hospital1 5**]
   - Continue ceftriaxone 2g daily
 if CSF cultures return negative,
   continue at 1g daily for UTI (not meningitis dosing)
   - F/u blood, urine, CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE,
   West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per ID recs)
   - EKG [**Hospital1 **] to evaluate for QT prolongation
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears [**Hospital1 **]
   - HIV status once pt able to give consent.
   - MRI head today
 will f/u
   - Seizure precautions
   .
   * Fever - Most likely due to malaria, as above.  Pneumonia unlikely as
   CXR clear. She has mild pyuria on her UA - ?whether her reported right
   flank pain may have been [**12-22**] pyelonephritis. No diarrhea or abdominal
   tenderness worrisome for an infectious GI process.
   - Malaria empiric treatment as above
   - Continuing ceftriaxone as above
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies, blood and urine cultures
   - Call OSH for pending micro results
   - Obtain further records regarding prior malaria treatment and workup
   from [**Hospital1 958**]
 request faxed [**2184-7-14**] at 1400. Medical Records number
   above.
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Concern for hemolysis but Hapto,
   LDH, T. bili WNL.  INR only minimally elevated - think DIC is less
   likely. Pt currently with period which may be contributing.
   - Follow CBC
   -Check coags, if concerning, will add remainder of DIC labs
   .
   * Domestic abuse
   - Social work consult
   - Screen visitors

","Summary:
- The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of P. falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental status.
- She was intubated for airway protection and received plasma exchange transfusion to decrease parasitemia.
- She has been on IV quinidine and other medications as per ID and neuro recommendations.
- She underwent lumbar puncture, which does not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis.
- Head CT shows no evidence of bleed or mass lesion to account for her symptoms.
- Anemia, fever, and potential domestic abuse are also noted.
- Further investigations and treatments are ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient had a questionable seizure, and an EEG is pending to evaluate for nonconvulsive status or post-ictal state.
2. Malaria: The patient has a history of P. falciparum malaria and continues to be monitored for complications related to this infection.
3. Airway Compromise: Due to altered mental status, the patient requires airway protection, and intubation has been performed.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, and appropriate precautions and cultures are being taken.
5. Hemolysis: Anemia is present, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, such as hemolysis or other factors.
6. Thrombotic events: The patient's coagulation profile should be closely monitored for"

 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
 MALARIA
   .
   Assessment and Plan:
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 Pt continues to be unresponsive, even when
   off propofol. Currently, suspected cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P.
   falciparum malaria.  Patient had questionable seizure and remains
   altered. She does not have a known seizure disorder. Current
   confusional state may reflect post-ictal status or, less likely,
   nonconvulsive status. I am most concerned for an underlying CNS
   infection.
   .
   Bacterial meningitis seems less likely in the face of an unremarkable
   CSF wbc count, protein, and glucose. Her elevated CSF RBC count raises
   the question of herpes encephalitis - however would expect elevated
   protein with CNS herpes; suspect RBCs are [**12-22**] to traumatic OSH spinal
   tap.
   .
   She is not known to be HIV positive - though this needs to be
   clarified.
   .
   Among other noninfectious causes of her confusion, consider also toxic
   ingestion though less likely with her negative tox screens. Her basic
   metabolic panel here is notable only for mild hyperglycemia and an
   anion gap (see below). Head CT shows no evidence of bleed or mass
   lesion to account for her symptoms.
   .
   - Intubate for airway protection
   - Empiric IV quinidine. Consider discussing with CDC regarding
   artemesinin availability.
   - Will continue acyclovir for now pending HSV PCR though think less
   likely
   - Continue ceftriaxone 2g daily given increased risk of GNR infection
   in this setting
   - Continuous EKG monitoring while on quinidine
   - Follow fingerstick q4h
   - Follow parasite smears daily
   - Given concern for CNS malaria will discuss exchange transfusion with
   bloodbank
   - HIV
   - EEG
   - Add on Ca/Mag/Phos
   - Consider MRI head
   - Seizure precautions
   - ID recommendations appreciated
   - Consider neurology consult
   .
   * Fever
   Fevers are most likely due to malaria, as above. Other considerations
   includ aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia given her altered mental
   status; however her CXR does not show any infiltrate. She has mild
   pyuria on her UA - ?whether her reported right flank pain may have been
   [**12-22**] pyelonephritis. No diarrhea or abdominal tenderness worrisome for
   an infectious GI process.
   - Malaria empiric treatment as above
   - Continuing ceftriaxone as above
   - Follow up pending blood cultures, add on urine culture
   - Call OSH for pending micro results
   - Obtain further records regarding treatment and workup from [**Hospital1 958**]
   .
   * Gap acidosis
   Malaria could cause acidosis. [**Month (only) 8**] be due to starvation ketosis given
   urine ketones. Not hyperglycemic to suggest DKA. Lactate is within
   normal limits. Ingestion a consideration but less likely with negative
   urine and serum tox screens.
   - Repeat electrolytes
   - Add on Osms
   - Check ABG
   .
   * Anemia
   Baseline Hct uncertain. With question of malaria hemolysis is obviously
   a concern - however patient's total bilirubin is within normal limits.
   No report of bleeding. INR only minimally elevated - think DIC is less
   likely.
   - Add on haptoglobin/LDH, fibrinogen, check peripheral smear
   - Follow CBC and coags [**Hospital1 **], maintain T+S, transfuse Hct>25
   .
   * Domestic abuse
   - Social work consult
   - Screen visitors

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yof from [**Country 1773**] with probable CNS Malaria
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated predominately for airway protection.
   No evidence for active  pulmonary disease.  Plan continue mechanical
   ventilation, adjust tube [**12-23**] cms (right mainstem intubation on most
   recent CXR).  Monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- found down, and unresponsive in the field.
   Unclear duration.  Concerns include ingestion/OD, seizure with
   postictal state or status epilepticus, CNS infection (encephalitis
   rather than meningitis), acute stroke syndrome, malaria with CNS
   involvement (i.e. cerebral malaria).  No signs suicide attempt.  Doubt
   cardiac event.   Initial CT scan (outside hosptial) suggests sulci
   effacement, although poor quality scan.  Head CT unrevealing.  EEG
   (possible continuous), follow up CSF cultures (check for HSV), maintain
   mechanical ventilation.  For MRI of head.
   MALARIA -- Falciparum.  High mortality rate on appropriate therapy.
   Quinidine Rx.  Follow parasite peripheral blood smears.  Monitor
   glucose, monitor Mg.  Transfusion Medicine consultation in progress.
   ID consultation in progress.  Empiric IV quinidine, consider
   artemesinin (available through CDC).  Monitor ECG, glucose.
   FEVER -- attributed to malaria.  Maintain concerns for other sources,
   related to malaria or other complicating infections.  Monitor cultures.
   ANEMIA -- attributed in part to malaria.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic.  Monitor I/O.  Now with PICC and central access
   (via phoresis catheter).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with respiratory failure who is intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient required reintubation after the unplanned removal of the endotracheal tube during repositioning. The patient's sedation level is mentioned as occasional opening of eyes and upper arms, which are non-purposeful. The patient is unable to provide any history due to sedation and unresponsiveness.

The patient has been on multiple medications including vancomycin, acyclovir, doxycycline, and ceftriaxone. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.8°C (101.9°F), heart rate of 90 bpm (with a range of 84-120 bpm), blood pressure of 101/50 mmHg (with a range of 97/48-123/89 mmHg), respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (with a range of 14-25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's review of systems is unremarkable except for hyperglycemia. The physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, no overt weight gain or loss, no conjunctival edema, normal heart rhythm, and clear breath sounds with no wheezing or crackles.

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yof from [**Country 1773**] with probable CNS Malaria
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated predominately for airway protection.
   No evidence for active  pulmonary disease.  Plan continue mechanical
   ventilation, adjust tube [**12-23**] cms (right mainstem intubation on most
   recent CXR).  Monitor ABG.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- found down, and unresponsive in the field.
   Unclear duration.  Concerns include ingestion/OD, seizure with
   postictal state or status epilepticus, CNS infection (encephalitis
   rather than meningitis), acute stroke syndrome, malaria with CNS
   involvement (i.e. cerebral malaria).  No signs suicide attempt.  Doubt
   cardiac event.   Initial CT scan (outside hosptial) suggests sulci
   effacement, although poor quality scan.  Head CT unrevealing.  EEG
   (possible continuous), follow up CSF cultures (check for HSV), maintain
   mechanical ventilation.  For MRI of head.
   MALARIA -- Falciparum.  High mortality rate on appropriate therapy.
   Quinidine Rx.  Follow parasite peripheral blood smears.  Monitor
   glucose, monitor Mg.  Transfusion Medicine consultation in progress.
   ID consultation in progress.  Empiric IV quinidine, consider
   artemesinin (available through CDC).  Monitor ECG, glucose.
   FEVER -- attributed to malaria.  Maintain concerns for other sources,
   related to malaria or other complicating infections.  Monitor cultures.
   ANEMIA -- attributed in part to malaria.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic.  Monitor I/O.  Now with PICC and central access
   (via phoresis catheter).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male with respiratory failure who is intubated and mechanically ventilated. He remains sedated and unresponsive. The patient was admitted with probable CNS Malaria and is currently receiving treatment for malaria with quinidine. He also has altered mental status, anemia, fever, and hypovolemia. The patient has multiple IV lines, including a PICC line and a pheresis catheter. He is being monitored closely in the ICU with plans for an MRI of the head and ongoing ID and transfusion medicine consultations. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and sepsis. These complications are common in critically ill patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation and can be associated with the patient's underlying conditions and interventions. Close monitoring and appropriate prophylactic measures are necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 Pt continues to be unresponsive, even when
   off propofol. Currently, suspected cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P.
   falciparum malaria. However, other causes must be considered. Patient
   had questionable seizure although no known seizure disorder and remains
   altered. Current confusional state may reflect post-ictal status or,
   less likely, nonconvulsive status. EEG performed today. LP performed
   does not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status
   unknown although pt negative 2 y ago per friends.  Toxic ingestion less
   likely as tox screens negative (Benzo
s positive most likely b/c pt
   received ativan for ?seizure). Head CT shows no evidence of bleed or
   mass lesion to account for her symptoms. MRI pending. Pt intubated
   yesterday for airway protection.  She received plasma exchange
   transfusion yesterday to decrease parasitemia. Last smear negative.
   -Appreciate ID and neuro recs- will f/u
   -Continue IV quinidine. If pt has s/e, call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8534**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8535**] (ID)- CDC
   papers for artemesinin are in back of pt
s chart.
   - Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR
 f/u at [**Hospital1 958**] and [**Hospital1 5**]
   - Continue ceftriaxone 2g daily
 if CSF cultures return negative,
   continue at 1g daily for UTI (not meningitis dosing)
   - F/u blood, urine, CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE,
   West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per ID recs)
   - EKG [**Hospital1 **] to evaluate for QT prolongation
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears [**Hospital1 **]
   - HIV status once pt able to give consent.
   - MRI head today
 will f/u
   - Seizure precautions
   .
   * Fever - Most likely due to malaria, as above.  Pneumonia unlikely as
   CXR clear. She has mild pyuria on her UA - ?whether her reported right
   flank pain may have been [**12-22**] pyelonephritis. No diarrhea or abdominal
   tenderness worrisome for an infectious GI process.
   - Malaria empiric treatment as above
   - Continuing ceftriaxone as above
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies, blood and urine cultures
   - Call OSH for pending micro results
   - Obtain further records regarding prior malaria treatment and workup
   from [**Hospital1 958**]
 request faxed [**2184-7-14**] at 1400. Medical Records number
   above.
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Concern for hemolysis but Hapto,
   LDH, T. bili WNL.  INR only minimally elevated - think DIC is less
   likely. Pt currently with period which may be contributing.
   - Follow CBC
   -Check coags, if concerning, will add remainder of DIC labs
   .
   * Domestic abuse
   - Social work consult
   - Screen visitors

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of P. falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. The patient continues to be unresponsive, even when off propofol. The suspected diagnosis is cerebral malaria; however, other causes such as seizures or nonconvulsive status should be considered. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 109/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurologic examination shows no posturing, makes purposeful movements with noxious stimuli, and toes downgoing bilaterally with no clonus. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolyte levels, and kidney function. Liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are within normal limits. The patient has negative RPR, cryptococcal antigen, and CSF culture results. 

The patient has been treated with plasma exchange transfusion to decrease parasitemia and is currently receiving IV quinidine. Other medications include acyclovir pending HSV PCR, ceftriaxone 2g daily, famotidine, and TPN without lipids. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizures: The patient had a questionable seizure, and there"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 MS much improved and now following commands.
    Currently, suspect cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P. falciparum
   malaria. However, other causes must be considered. Patient had
   questionable seizure although no known seizure disorder and remains
   altered. Current confusional state may reflect post-ictal status or,
   less likely, nonconvulsive status. EEG performed yesterday with read
   pending. LP performed does not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB
   meningitis. HIV status unknown although pt negative 2 y ago per
   friends.  Toxic ingestion less likely as tox screens negative (Benzo
   positive most likely b/c pt received ativan for ?seizure). Head CT
   shows no evidence of bleed or mass lesion to account for her symptoms.
   MRI done yesterday but read pending. Pt intubated for airway protection
   only and now that she is following commands, will plan to extubate this
   AM.  She received plasma exchange transfusion on day of admission to
   decrease parasitemia. Last smear negative.
   -Appreciate ID and neuro recs- will f/u
   -Continue IV quinidine at lowered dose suggested by ID. If pt has s/e,
   call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8534**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8535**] (ID)- CDC papers for artemesinin are in back of pt
   chart.
   - Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR
 f/u at [**Hospital1 958**] and [**Hospital1 5**]- can d/c
   once negative
   - s/p 3 days of ceftriaxone, initially to cover for possible meningitis
   but doses changed to tx pyuria
   - F/u blood, urine, CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE,
   West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per ID recs)
   - EKG [**Hospital1 **] to evaluate for QT prolongation
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears [**Hospital1 **]
   - HIV status once pt able to give consent.
   - f/u read of MRI, EEG
   - Seizure precautions
   - extubate today
   .
   * Fever - Most likely due to malaria, as above.  Pneumonia unlikely as
   CXR clear. She has mild pyuria on her UA - ?whether her reported right
   flank pain may have been [**12-22**] pyelonephritis. No diarrhea or abdominal
   tenderness worrisome for an infectious GI process.
   - Malaria empiric treatment as above
   - s/p ceftriaxone as above
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies, blood and urine cultures
   - Call OSH for pending micro results
   - Obtain further records regarding prior malaria treatment and workup
   from [**Hospital1 958**]
 request faxed [**2184-7-14**] at 1400. Medical Records number
   above.
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Concern for hemolysis as elevated t
   bili today.  INR only minimally elevated - think DIC is less likely. Pt
   currently with period which may be contributing.  Will trend hct [**Hospital1 **].
   - Follow CBC
   -Check coags, if concerning, will add remainder of DIC labs
   .
   * Domestic abuse
   - Social work consult
   - Screen visitors

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yof from [**Country 1773**] with probable CNS Malaria
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated predominately for airway protection.
   No evidence for active  pulmonary disease.  Good progress.  Plan to
   move to extubation trial.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Much improved.  Attributed to cerebral
   malaria.  Initially found down, and unresponsive in the field.  Unclear
   duration.  Concerns include ingestion/OD, seizure with postictal state
   or status epilepticus, CNS infection (encephalitis rather than
   meningitis), acute stroke syndrome, malaria with CNS involvement (i.e.
   cerebral malaria).  No signs suicide attempt.  Doubt cardiac event.
   Initial CT scan (outside hosptial) suggests sulci effacement, although
   poor quality scan.  Head CT unrevealing.  EEG (possible continuous),
   follow up CSF cultures (check for HSV), maintain mechanical
   ventilation.  MRI of head unrevealing.
   MALARIA -- Falciparum.  High mortality rate on appropriate therapy.
   Quinidine Rx.  Follow parasite peripheral blood smears.  Monitor
   glucose, monitor Mg.  Transfusion Medicine consultation in progress.
   ID consultation in progress.  Empiric IV quinidine, consider
   artemesinin (available through CDC).  Monitor ECG, glucose.
   FEVER -- attributed to malaria.  Maintain concerns for other sources,
   related to malaria or other complicating infections.  Monitor cultures.
   ANEMIA -- attributed in part to malaria.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic.  Monitor I/O.  Now with PICC and central access
   (via phoresis catheter).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- hold TF pending extubation trial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male from Country 1773 with probable CNS Malaria. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. There is no evidence of active pulmonary disease. The patient's mental status has improved significantly, likely due to cerebral malaria. He was found unresponsive in the field and initial concerns included ingestion/OD, seizure, CNS infection, acute stroke syndrome, or malaria with CNS involvement. A head CT scan showed sulci effacement, but subsequent scans were unrevealing. The patient is receiving empiric IV quinidine for malaria and artemesinin through CDC consultation. He is also being monitored for glucose levels and electrolyte imbalances. Fever is attributed to malaria, but other sources are also being considered. The patient has anemia, which may be attributed to malaria. He is hypovolemic and receiving IV fluids. Nutritional support is on hold pending extubation trials. The patient has multiple lines in place for medication administration and pheresis catheter. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prevention and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yof from [**Country 1773**] with probable CNS Malaria
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated predominately for airway protection.
   No evidence for active  pulmonary disease.  Good progress.  Plan to
   move to extubation trial.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- Much improved.  Attributed to cerebral
   malaria.  Initially found down, and unresponsive in the field.  Unclear
   duration.  Concerns include ingestion/OD, seizure with postictal state
   or status epilepticus, CNS infection (encephalitis rather than
   meningitis), acute stroke syndrome, malaria with CNS involvement (i.e.
   cerebral malaria).  No signs suicide attempt.  Doubt cardiac event.
   Initial CT scan (outside hosptial) suggests sulci effacement, although
   poor quality scan.  Head CT unrevealing.  EEG (possible continuous),
   follow up CSF cultures (check for HSV), maintain mechanical
   ventilation.  MRI of head unrevealing.
   MALARIA -- Falciparum.  High mortality rate on appropriate therapy.
   Quinidine Rx.  Follow parasite peripheral blood smears.  Monitor
   glucose, monitor Mg.  Transfusion Medicine consultation in progress.
   ID consultation in progress.  Empiric IV quinidine, consider
   artemesinin (available through CDC).  Monitor ECG, glucose.
   FEVER -- attributed to malaria.  Maintain concerns for other sources,
   related to malaria or other complicating infections.  Monitor cultures.
   ANEMIA -- attributed in part to malaria.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic.  Monitor I/O.  Now with PICC and central access
   (via phoresis catheter).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male from Country 1773 with a probable diagnosis of CNS Malaria. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, which is attributed to airway protection rather than active pulmonary disease. The patient's mental status has improved significantly, likely due to cerebral malaria. He has been unresponsive in the field, and concerns include ingestion/OD, seizure with postictal state or status epilepticus, CNS infection (encephalitis rather than meningitis), acute stroke syndrome, and malaria with CNS involvement (i.e., cerebral malaria). Initial CT scan suggests sulci effacement, but it is a poor-quality scan. Head CT is unrevealing, and an MRI of the head is also unrevealing. 

The patient has been started on quinidine therapy for malaria and will have regular monitoring of parasite peripheral blood smears. He will also be monitored for glucose levels and magnesium levels. A consultation with Transfusion Medicine and Infectious Disease is in progress. Empiric IV quinidine and consideration of artemesinin (available through CDC) will be given. Continuous EEG and follow-up CSF cultures will be done. 

The patient has anemia, likely attributed to malaria, and is hypovolemic. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing, with a PICC line and central access through a pheresis catheter. Nutritional support will be initiated via tube feeding (TF).

   There are findings suggestive of venous hyperemia, which could

   with CSF
   sampling is suggested.
   [**7-15**] EEG-
   Abnormal portable EEG due to the very low voltage slow
   background at the beginning of the recording. This appeared to be due
   to medication effect. After weaning off the propofol there was some
   drowsiness and some sleep. There were no focal abnormalities or
   epileptiform features.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 MS much improved from admission and now
   following commands.  Currently, suspect cerebral malaria as pt has h/o
   P. falciparum malaria. MRI done demonstrates findings c/w
   infection/inflammation. She received plasma exchange transfusion on day
   of admission to decrease parasitemia. Last smear negative. However,
   other causes must be considered. Patient had seizure yesterday,
   although no known seizure disorder. Current confusional state may
   reflect post-ictal status or, less likely, nonconvulsive status. EEG
   performed yesterday with results above. LP does not suggest bacterial
   meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status unknown although pt negative 2
   y ago per friends. Toxic ingestion less likely as tox screens negative
   (Benzo
s positive most likely b/c pt received ativan for ?seizure).
   -Appreciate ID and neuro recs- will f/u
   - Continue IV quinidine for one more day. If pt has s/e, call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8534**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. She received plasma exchange transfusion on admission to decrease parasitemia. The patient's MRI shows findings consistent with infection/inflammation, and she had a seizure yesterday. Her CSF analysis does not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis. Toxic ingestion is less likely as tox screens are negative. The patient's HIV status is unknown, but she tested negative two years ago per friends.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral malaria: Given the patient's history of P. falciparum malaria and altered mental status, cerebral malaria is a potential complication.
2. Seizure: The patient had a generalized seizure lasting 30-45 seconds, which may be related to her underlying condition or another cause.
3. Post-ictal state: The patient's confusional state may reflect a post-ictal state following the seizure.
4. Nonconvulsive status: Although less likely, the patient's current confusional state could also indicate nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
5. Infection/inflammation: The MRI findings suggest venous hyperemia, which could be secondary to infectious or inflammatory processes.
6. Bacterial meningitis: Although the CSF analysis does not currently suggest bacterial meningitis, it cannot be completely ruled out.
7. TB meningitis: The CSF analysis also does not"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 MS much improved and now following commands.
   Currently, suspect cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P. falciparum
   malaria. However, other causes must be considered. Patient had
   questionable seizure although no known seizure disorder and remains
   altered. Current confusional state may reflect post-ictal status or,
   less likely, nonconvulsive status. EEG performed yesterday with read
   pending. LP performed does not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB
   meningitis. HIV status unknown although pt negative 2 y ago per
   friends.  Toxic ingestion less likely as tox screens negative (Benzo
   positive most likely b/c pt received ativan for ?seizure). Head CT
   shows no evidence of bleed or mass lesion to account for her symptoms.
   MRI done yesterday but read pending. Pt intubated for airway protection
   only and now that she is following commands, will plan to extubate this
   AM.  She received plasma exchange transfusion on day of admission to
   decrease parasitemia. Last smear negative.
   -Appreciate ID and neuro recs- will f/u
   -Continue IV quinidine at lowered dose suggested by ID. If pt has s/e,
   call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8534**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8535**] (ID)- CDC papers for artemesinin are in back of pt

   - Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR
 f/u at [**Hospital1 958**] and [**Hospital1 5**]- can d/c
   once negative
   - s/p 3 days of ceftriaxone, initially to cover for possible meningitis
   but doses changed to tx pyuria
   - F/u blood, urine, CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE,
   West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per ID recs)
   - EKG [**Hospital1 **] to evaluate for QT prolongation
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears [**Hospital1 **]
   - HIV status once pt able to give consent.
   - f/u read of MRI, EEG
   - Seizure precautions
   - extubate today
   .
   * Fever - Most likely due to malaria, as above.  Pneumonia unlikely as
   CXR clear. She has mild pyuria on her UA - ?whether her reported right
   flank pain may have been [**12-22**] pyelonephritis. No diarrhea or abdominal
   tenderness worrisome for an infectious GI process.
   - Malaria empiric treatment as above
   - s/p ceftriaxone as above
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies, blood and urine cultures
   - Call OSH for pending micro results
   - Obtain further records regarding prior malaria treatment and workup
   from [**Hospital1 958**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a recent history of Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. She had a negative Gram stain, fungal culture, and viral culture from her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient underwent plasma exchange transfusion on admission to decrease parasitemia and has shown improvement in her mental status. She is currently on IV quinidine, and her last smear was negative. Other possible causes for her altered mental status, such as toxic ingestion, seizure, or nonconvulsive status, are being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral malaria: The patient's recent history of P. falciparum malaria and altered mental status suggest the possibility of cerebral malaria. Monitoring for any neurological deterioration or seizures is important.
2. Hemolysis: The elevated total bilirubin and possible period of hemolysis raise concerns for hemolysis. Trending the hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and monitoring for signs of anemia or hemolytic crisis is necessary.
3. Infection: Despite the negative CSF results, there is still a possibility of other infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection (UTI). Ongoing surveillance for fever, respiratory symptoms, or urinary symptoms is crucial.
4. Seizure: Although the EEG did not show epileptiform features, the patient had a generalized seizure. Continued seizure precautions and monitoring for any further seizure activity are required"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female from [Country 1773] with a history of recent falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status and seizure activity, presumed to be cerebral malaria. She was successfully extubated yesterday and loaded with phenytoin. The patient has shown significant improvement in her condition. She is currently alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 111/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving various medications including ceftriaxone, acyclovir, doxycycline, fosphenytoin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Malaria: The patient's history of recent falciparum malaria and presentation with altered mental status and seizure activity suggest probable cerebral malaria. This condition can lead to severe neurological complications, including seizures, coma, and even death if not promptly treated.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient experienced a seizure episode yesterday, which could be attributed to the CSF infection or malaria. Phosphenytoin was loaded to manage the seizure activity. Further neurology recommendations regarding further imaging or need for repeat EEG should be considered.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient had a three-day course"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old female from Country 1773 with a chief complaint of altered mental status and probable CNS malaria. The patient was extubated yesterday and experienced a brief seizure, for which fosphenytoin was loaded. She has been receiving treatment with ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and doxycycline. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/58 to 124/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's weight has increased from 53.4 kg at admission to 57 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 5,174 mL and output of 4,180 mL, resulting in a balance of 994 mL. She is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen but not on mechanical ventilation. The patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin without rash. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement. Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Imaging studies include an MRI head and EEG without focal abnormalities."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53.4 kg female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoactive delirium and is currently on various medications including quinidine, doxycycline, dilantin, and phenytoin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies have been ordered, including L-spine for back pain and CSF studies for infectious causes. The patient's condition is being monitored closely with continuous EEG and daily dilantin trough levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative 552 mL over 24 hours, indicating possible fluid loss or inadequate fluid administration. This could lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
2. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient's altered mental status and hypoactive delirium may increase the risk of aspiration and impaired airway clearance. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent respiratory complications.
3. Malaria: Although the parasite smear is pending and negative yesterday, the patient's symptoms and travel history raise suspicion for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. 

The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. However, it is mentioned that the patient pulled out their PICC line and a new PIV line with a pheresis catheter was placed. They are still receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and a quinidine drip. The patient's antibiotic, doxycycline, has been changed to oral administration.

In terms of neurological assessment, the patient is experiencing psychomotor slowing but no focal deficits. A continuous 24-hour EEG has been ordered, and daily dilantin trough levels will be monitored with a target level greater than 10 (goal 9-7). Neuroimaging is not required at this time, but the neuro team will follow up on the EEG results.

Psych consultation reveals that the patient is experiencing hypoactive delirium, and no changes to medications have been made. The psych consultant will continue to follow up with the patient until their delirium clears. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were ceftriaxone on 07/16/2184 at 09:53 AM and acyclovir on 07/17/2184 at 12:41 AM. Doxycycline was started on 07/17/2184 at 10:00 AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 MS much improved from admission and now
   following commands.  Currently, suspect cerebral malaria as pt has h/o
   P. falciparum malaria. MRI done demonstrates findings c/w
   infection/inflammation. She received plasma exchange transfusion on day
   of admission to decrease parasitemia. Last smear negative. However,
   other causes must be considered. Patient had seizure yesterday,
   although no known seizure disorder. Current confusional state may
   reflect post-ictal status or, less likely, nonconvulsive status. EEG
   performed yesterday with results above. LP does not suggest bacterial
   meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status unknown although pt negative 2
   y ago per friends. Toxic ingestion less likely as tox screens negative
   (Benzo
s positive most likely b/c pt received ativan for ?seizure).
   -Appreciate ID and neuro recs- will f/u
   - Continue IV quinidine for one more day. If pt has s/e, call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8534**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8535**] (ID)- CDC papers for artemesinin are in back of pt
s chart. QTc
   this AM was normal.
   - F/u HSV PCR at [**Hospital1 958**]
 if negative, can d/c acyclovir. Also, would
   expect MRI changes if this is HSV.
   - Completed 3 days of ceftriaxone for uncomplicated UTI
   - F/u blood, urine, CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE,
   West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per ID recs)
   - EKG [**Hospital1 **] to evaluate for QT prolongation
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears [**Hospital1 **]
 will check with ID as to when they can
   be d/c
d as they have been negative to date.
   - HIV status once pt able to give consent.
   - Seizure precautions
   -Neuro- if pt is not herself, will do continuous EEG monitoring and
   repeat MRI
   -t/b with family/friends as to whether pt is at her baseline
   .
   * Fever
 Resolved. Most likely due to malaria.
   - Malaria empiric treatment as above
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies, blood and urine cultures
   - Call OSH for pending micro results
   - Obtain further records regarding prior malaria treatment and workup
   from [**Hospital1 958**]
 request faxed [**2184-7-14**] at 1400. Medical Records number in
   team census.
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Hemolysis labs unremarkable. Coags
   nl so DIC less likely.
   - Follow CBC
   .
   * Depression
 pt with h/o depression and suicide attempts. Also victim
   of domestic abuse
   - Psych consult
   - Social work consult

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. She underwent plasma exchange transfusion on the day of admission to decrease parasitemia. The patient's condition has improved, and she is now following commands. An MRI was performed, demonstrating findings consistent with infection/inflammation. Other potential causes for her altered mental status include seizure activity, post-ictal state, nonconvulsive status, bacterial or tuberculosis meningitis, toxic ingestion, and HIV infection. The patient's seizure was managed with ativan, and her toxicology screens were negative. She received treatment for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection with ceftriaxone. The patient's fever has resolved, likely due to malaria treatment. Further investigations include pending CSF studies, blood and urine cultures, and parasite smears. The patient's baseline HIV status is unknown. She also has a history of depression and suicide attempts. The patient's anemia is being monitored, and coagulation studies are normal, making disseminated intravascular coagulation less likely. The patient's glycemic control will be managed with insulin sliding scale. She is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. She has undergone plasma exchange transfusion to decrease parasitemia and is currently on IV quinidine. The patient's condition has improved with improved mental status and no seizures reported recently. However, she still exhibits psychomotor slowing. The patient's fever has resolved, and other potential causes of her symptoms, such as bacterial or tuberculous meningitis, have been ruled out through lumbar puncture results. 

The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts, as well as domestic abuse. She is being followed up with psychiatric recommendations and social work support. Her nutrition has been advanced to a regular diet with additional supplements. She has been encouraged to engage in assisted activities, but this resulted in ataxia, and a neurology consultation has been obtained.

Medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cerebral malaria: The patient's symptoms are consistent with cerebral malaria, which can lead to severe neurological complications.
2. Seizures: Although the patient had a seizure in the past, ongoing seizure precautions and administration of Dilantin indicate the concern for recurrent seizures.
3. Hypoglycemia: Quinidine, the antimalarial drug being administered, can cause hypoglycemia, necessitating frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels.
4. QT prolongation: Quinidine can also affect"

   Disposition: -call out in AM once off quinidine drip
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged woman with multiple medical issues and complications. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure secondary to septic encephalopathy and possible Lyme disease. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoactive delirium, psychomotor slowing, and seizures.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate within normal limits and blood pressure ranging from 101/73 mmHg to 112/86 mmHg. Respiratory rate is normal at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation remains at 99%. The patient is arousable and follows commands, but there is a language barrier.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, normal glucose levels ranging from 119-126 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 346 K/uL. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L. Other lab results, including liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and cardiac markers, are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance is negative by 552 mL, indicating ongoing fluid loss. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen delivery device in use and normal arterial blood gas (ABG) levels.

The patient has multiple lines and catheters"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 MS much improved from admission and now
   following commands.  Currently, suspect cerebral malaria as pt has h/o
   P. falciparum malaria. MRI done demonstrates findings c/w
   infection/inflammation. She received plasma exchange transfusion on day
   of admission to decrease parasitemia. Last smear negative. However,
   other causes must be considered. Patient had seizure yesterday,
   although no known seizure disorder. Current confusional state may
   reflect post-ictal status or, less likely, nonconvulsive status. EEG
   performed yesterday with results above. LP does not suggest bacterial
   meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status unknown although pt negative 2
   y ago per friends. Toxic ingestion less likely as tox screens negative
   (Benzo
s positive most likely b/c pt received ativan for ?seizure).
   -Appreciate ID and neuro recs- will f/u
   - Continue IV quinidine for one more day. If pt has s/e, call [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8534**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8535**] (ID)- CDC papers for artemesinin are in back of pt
s chart. QTc
   this AM was normal.
   - F/u HSV PCR at [**Hospital1 958**]
 if negative, can d/c acyclovir. Also, would
   expect MRI changes if this is HSV.
   - Completed 3 days of ceftriaxone for uncomplicated UTI
   - F/u blood, urine, CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE,
   West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per ID recs)
   - EKG [**Hospital1 **] to evaluate for QT prolongation
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears [**Hospital1 **]
 will check with ID as to when they can
   be d/c
d as they have been negative to date.
   - HIV status once pt able to give consent.
   - Seizure precautions
   -Neuro- if pt is not herself, will do continuous EEG monitoring and
   repeat MRI
   -t/b with family/friends as to whether pt is at her baseline
   .
   * Fever
 Resolved. Most likely due to malaria.
   - Malaria empiric treatment as above
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies, blood and urine cultures
   - Call OSH for pending micro results
   - Obtain further records regarding prior malaria treatment and workup
   from [**Hospital1 958**]
 request faxed [**2184-7-14**] at 1400. Medical Records number in
   team census.
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Hemolysis labs unremarkable. Coags
   nl so DIC less likely.
   - Follow CBC
   .
   * Depression
 pt with h/o depression and suicide attempts. Also victim
   of domestic abuse
   - Psych consult
   - Social work consult
   - Screen visitors

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with recent Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. The patient has shown improvement in mental status since admission and is now following commands. She underwent plasma exchange transfusion on the day of admission to decrease parasitemia, and the last smear was negative. However, other causes must be considered.

The patient experienced a seizure yesterday, although she has no known seizure disorder. Her current confusional state may reflect post-ictal status or nonconvulsive status.

HIV status is unknown, although the patient tested negative two years ago per friends. Toxic ingestion is less likely as tox screens were negative. CSF studies are pending.

The patient received ceftriaxone for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and completed three days of treatment. Blood, urine, and CSF studies are pending for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE, West Nile, and CMV. An EKG was done to evaluate for QT prolongation, and the patient is being monitored for hypoglycemia due to quinidine. Parasite smears will be checked as well.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female from [**Country 1773**] who has a history of recent falciparum malaria. She presented with altered mental status and seizures, which are presumed to be due to cerebral malaria. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/69 to 112/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has a well-nourished appearance, with no acute distress. Her eyes and pupils are normal, and she is not on any respiratory support. The cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and there is no murmur detected. Peripheral pulses are present and symmetric in both extremities. 

Abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, no distension or tenderness, and no signs of edema. Musculoskeletal examination is unremarkable, and skin assessment has not been conducted. Neurological examination indicates that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (12.9 thousand/mm³), decreased hemoglobin level (9.4 g/dL), increased platelet count (346 K/uL), elevated blood glucose level (126 mg"

","The patient is a 24-year-old female from Country 1773 who has a history of recent falciparum malaria. She presented with altered mental status and seizures, which are likely due to cerebral malaria. The patient's condition has improved, although she remains hypoactive and apathetic. This could be a component of depression or delirium complicating the assessment. Neuro and psychiatric input are appreciated.

The patient is currently being treated with intravenous quinidine and oral doxycycline for malaria. She is also on phenytoin for seizure management and dilantin has been started. Continuous EEG monitoring is planned for Monday.

The patient has a history of domestic violence, social situation, and depression. A psychiatric evaluation has been given, considering her history of depression and prior suicidal gestures.

The patient has anemia, which is partly attributed to malaria. Her hemoglobin level remains stable.

In the ICU, the patient's Foley catheter is out, and a consultation with the physical therapist is requested. The patient is encouraged to be out of bed with assistance. TPN without lipids is being administered at 45 mL/hour, but this will be stopped as the patient is tolerating oral intake.

Glycemic control is well maintained. The patient has two peripheral IV lines in place and the pheresis catheter will be discontinued as the patient already has PIVs.

Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP precautions"

   * Altered mental status
 MS much improved from admission and now
   following commands.  Currently, suspect cerebral malaria as pt has h/o
   P. falciparum malaria. MRI done demonstrates findings c/w
   infection/inflammation. She received plasma exchange transfusion on day
   of admission to decrease parasitemia. Last smear negative. However,
   other causes were considered. Patient had seizure [**7-16**], although no
   known seizure disorder. Current confusional state may reflect
   post-ictal status or, less likely, nonconvulsive status. EEG performed
   yesterday with results above. LP does not suggest bacterial meningitis
   or TB meningitis. HIV status unknown although pt negative 2 y ago per
   friends. Toxic ingestion less likely as tox screens negative (Benzo
   positive most likely b/c pt received ativan for ?seizure).
   -Appreciate ID and neuro recs- will f/u
   - Continue IV quinidine pending ID recs to stop (will need two more
   days)
   - d/c acyclovir yesterday as HSV PCR negative at [**Hospital1 958**]
   - Completed 3 days of ceftriaxone for uncomplicated UTI
   - F/u blood, urine, CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE,
   West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per ID recs)
   - EKG daily to evaluate for QT prolongation on quinidine
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears [**Hospital1 **]
 will check with ID as to when they can
   be d/c

   - HIV status once pt able to give consent.
   - Seizure precautions
   - plan for 24 hr EEG soon per neuro
   - started Dilantin for seizures

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. She has undergone plasma exchange transfusion and received treatment with quinidine. Her condition has improved, and she is now following commands. Other potential causes for her altered mental status were considered, including seizures, bacterial or tuberculous meningitis, toxic ingestion, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. EEG results are pending, but HSV PCR was negative, and she was discharged from acyclovir. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 99/56 mmHg and a heart rate of 72 bpm. She has a fever that resolved, likely due to malaria. Her hemoglobin level is 8.9 g/dL, and her platelet count is 299,000/mm3. The results of her CSF studies, blood cultures, and parasite smears are pending. She is currently on quinidine and has been advised to follow up with ID and neuro recommendations. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral malaria: The patient's recent history of P. falciparum malaria and altered mental status suggest cerebral malaria as a potential complication.
2. Seizures: The patient had a seizure on July 16th, indicating a risk of recurrent seizures.
3. Hypoglycemia: Quinidine can cause hypoglycemia, so"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -advanced diet to POs with ensure tid supplement, activity to with
   assistance
   - per ID, keep on quinidine drip tonight and likely d/c tomorrow after
   seen by ID; keep checking peripheral smear daily
   - one episode of emesis after po intake with lunch
   - BPs trending down throughout evening- given IVF bolus and maintenance
   as low po intake
   - getting 24 hour EEG now- started around 4?: around 0030 patient
   pulled off many of the EEG leads while attempting to go to bedside
   commode.  Tried to contact EEG [**Name2 (NI) 726**] for lead replacement but was
   unsuccessful.  Notified neuro resident, and he's unlikely to be able to
   come reconnect patient.  Will probably need repeat study in future but
   no acute danger now as pt is therapeutic on dilantin

   24 Hour Events:
   -advanced diet to POs with ensure tid supplement, activity to with
   assistance
   - per ID, keep on quinidine drip tonight and likely d/c tomorrow after
   seen by ID; keep checking peripheral smear daily
   - one episode of emesis after po intake with lunch
   - BPs trending down throughout evening- given IVF bolus and maintenance
   as low po intake
   - getting 24 hour EEG now- started around 4?: around 0030 patient
   pulled off many of the EEG leads while attempting to go to bedside

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 broad diff incl cerebral malaria, seizure, MS
   much improved from admission and now following commands.  Currently,
   suspect cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P. falciparum malaria. MRI done
   demonstrates findings c/w infection/inflammation. She received plasma
   exchange transfusion on day of admission to decrease parasitemia. Last
   smear negative. However, other causes were considered. Patient had
   seizure [**7-16**], although no known seizure disorder. Current confusional
   state may reflect post-ictal status or, less likely, nonconvulsive
   status. EEG performed yesterday with results above. LP does not suggest
   bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status unknown although pt
   negative 2 y ago per friends. Toxic ingestion less likely as tox
   screens negative (Benzo
s positive most likely b/c pt received ativan
   for ?seizure).
   -Appreciate ID and neuro recs- will f/u
   - Continue IV quinidine pending ID recs to stop (will need two more
   days)
   - d/c acyclovir yesterday as HSV PCR negative at [**Hospital1 958**]
   - Completed 3 days of ceftriaxone for uncomplicated UTI
   - F/u blood, urine, CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE,
   West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per ID recs)
   - EKG daily to evaluate for QT prolongation on quinidine
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears [**Hospital1 **]
 will check with ID as to when they can
   be d/c
d as they have been negative to date.
   - HIV status once pt able to give consent.
   - Seizure precautions
   - plan for 24 hr EEG soon per neuro
   - started Dilantin for seizures
   .
   * Fever
 Resolved. Most likely due to malaria.
   - Malaria empiric treatment as above
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies, blood and urine cultures
   - [**Hospital1 958**] blood cx ngtd x 3 days, csf cx ngtd x 4 days
   - Obtain further records regarding prior malaria treatment and workup
   from [**Hospital1 958**]
 request faxed [**2184-7-14**] at 1400. Medical Records number in
   team census.
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Hemolysis labs unremarkable but
   parasites can cause hct drop. Coags nl so DIC less likely.
   - Follow CBC
   .
   * Depression
 pt with h/o depression and suicide attempts. Also victim
   of domestic abuse
   - f/u psych recs
   - Social work following
   - Screen visitors
   .
   *Nutrition- Advanced to regular diet with nutrition consult for calorie
   count.  Suggested additional Ensure tid and MVI daily which will be
   ordered.  Will monitor po intake and see if she needs more supplemental
   nutrition.
   .
   *Activity- Changed from bedrest to activity with assistance and seemed
   ataxic per NSG.  PT consulted and neuro following.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental status. She received plasma exchange transfusion on admission to decrease parasitemia and has since improved. However, other causes for her altered mental status were considered. The patient had a seizure on the 16th, and an MRI showed findings consistent with infection/inflammation. She was given IV quinidine and acyclovir, but the latter was discontinued due to negative HSV PCR results. The patient's HIV status is unknown, and further tests are pending, including blood, urine, and CSF studies for cultures and viral serologies. She is being monitored for seizures, and Dilantin has been started. The patient's fever has resolved, likely due to malaria treatment. Anemia is suspected, and coagulation studies are normal, making disseminated intravascular coagulation less likely. The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts and is a victim of domestic abuse. Nutrition and activity plans have been adjusted, and she is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral malaria: Given the patient's history of falciparum malaria and altered mental status, cerebral malaria is a potential complication.
2. Seizures: The patient experienced a seizure on the 16th, and seizure precautions are in place. She has been started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 much imrpoved since admission. broad diff
   incl cerebral malaria, seizure, meningoencephalitis, toxic ingestion,
   but most likely cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P. falciparum malaria
   and MRI done demonstrates findings c/w infection/inflammation. LP did
   not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status unknown
   although pt negative 2 y ago per friends. Toxic ingestion less likely
   as tox screens were negative.
   - F/U ID and Neuro recs
   - Continue IV quinidine and PO Doxy; IV quinidine is until 00:00 [**7-21**]
   per ID
   - F/u CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE, West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per
   ID recs)
   - EKG daily to evaluate for QT prolongation on quinidine
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears daily for now
   - consider HIV test with pt
s consent
   - Seizure precautions
   - F/U  EEG results, may have to repeat as likely suboptimal study (pt
   removed leads last night)
   - continue Dilantin for seizures, check daily Dilantin levels, check
   albumin for correction
   .
   * Fever
 Resolved. Most likely due to malaria.
   - Continue IV quinidine until 00:00 9/2 per ID, only PO doxy after that
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Hemolysis labs unremarkable but
   parasites can cause hct drop. Coags nl so DIC less likely.
   - Follow CBC
   - Fe studies, TSH, Vit B12, folate, Hb electropheresis
   .
   * Depression
 pt with h/o depression and suicide attempts. Also victim
   of domestic abuse.
   - f/u psych recs
   - Social work following
   - Screen visitors
   .
   *Nutrition- Advanced to regular diet with nutrition consult for calorie
   count.
   - continue Ensure tid and MVI daily
   - monitor po intake and see if she needs more supplemental nutrition.
   .
   *Activity- Changed from bedrest to activity with assistance and seemed
   ataxic per NSG.
   - PT consulted but pt was getting EEG, will see today

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. The patient's condition has improved since admission, and broad differentials including cerebral malaria, seizure, meningoencephalitis, and toxic ingestion were considered. However, cerebral malaria is considered the most likely cause given the patient's history of P. falciparum malaria and findings on MRI.

The patient has been started on IV quinidine and PO doxycycline. IV quinidine will be continued until September 21st per ID recommendations. The patient is also advised to follow fingerstick every 4 hours due to the potential hypoglycemia caused by quinidine. Parasite smears will be followed daily for now.

The patient's fever has resolved, most likely due to malaria. She will continue with IV quinidine until September 2nd per ID recommendations. The patient's anemia is being monitored with CBC and additional studies such as Fe, TSH, Vit B12, folate, and Hb electrophoresis. The patient's depression history and recent suicide attempts are noted, and psych and social work follow-ups are recommended. Nutrition and activity plans have also been implemented.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoglycemia: Quinidine can cause hypoglycemia, so the patient is being monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female from [**Country 1773**] with a history of recent falciparum malaria. She presented with altered mental status and seizures, presumed to be due to cerebral malaria. The patient's condition has improved, although she remains apathetic. Continuous EEG monitoring is ongoing to monitor for any further seizure activity. The patient is currently receiving IV quinidine for a total of 7 days, after which she will switch to oral doxycycline to complete the treatment course. Her social situation, including a history of domestic violence and depression, is being addressed by social work and a psychological evaluation. The patient also has anemia, which is being evaluated for thalassemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral malaria: The patient's altered mental status and seizures are likely due to cerebral malaria. This can lead to various complications, including prolonged altered mental status, seizures, organ dysfunction, and even death if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Seizure activity: The patient has had seizures, and continuous EEG monitoring is ongoing to detect any further seizure activity. If seizure activity recurs, it may indicate ongoing cerebral malaria or another underlying cause.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which has been attributed in part to malaria. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia, and appropriate management should be implemented to address this condition.

4. Thalassemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female from [Country 1773] with a history of recent falciparum malaria. She presented with altered mental status and seizure, which are presumed to be due to cerebral malaria. The patient's condition has improved, but she remains apathetic, possibly due to depression or delirium complicating the assessment. The patient is currently receiving quinidine therapy for malaria and is being monitored closely with daily EKG for QTc. Phosphenytoin was loaded, followed by dilantin to manage the seizure, and continuous EEG monitoring is ongoing. The patient also has a history of domestic violence, social situation, and depression, for which a psych evaluation has been conducted. Additionally, the patient is anemic, with a stable Hct level, and further investigations are planned. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 much imrpoved since admission. broad diff
   incl cerebral malaria, seizure, meningoencephalitis, toxic ingestion,
   but most likely cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P. falciparum malaria
   and MRI done demonstrates findings c/w infection/inflammation. LP did
   not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status unknown
   although pt negative 2 y ago per friends. Toxic ingestion less likely
   as tox screens were negative.
   - F/U ID and Neuro recs
   - Continue IV quinidine until blood smears clear
   - switch doxy from PO to IV
   - F/u CSF studies (sent for cultures, HSV PCR, Lyme, EEE, West [**Doctor First Name 3223**] per
   ID recs)
   - EKG daily to evaluate for QT prolongation on quinidine
   - Follow fingerstick q4h as quinidine can cause hypoglycemia
   - Follow parasite smears daily for now
   - f/u HIV (pt has already consented, HIV ordered)
   - Seizure precautions
   - F/U  EEG results, may have to repeat as likely suboptimal study (pt
   removed leads last night)
   - continue Dilantin for seizures, check daily Dilantin levels, check
   albumin for correction
   .
   * Fever
 Resolved. Most likely due to malaria.
   - Continue IV quinidine until 00:00 9/2 per ID, only PO doxy after that
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Hemolysis labs unremarkable but
   parasites can cause hct drop. Coags nl so DIC less likely.
   - Follow CBC
   - Fe studies, TSH, Vit B12, folate, Hb electropheresis
   .
   * Depression
 pt with h/o depression and suicide attempts. Also victim
   of domestic abuse.
   - f/u psych recs
   - given pt
s low PO intake and poor appetite, ask psych if mirtazepine
   is a good choice for her
   - Social work following
   - Screen visitors
   .
   *Nutrition- Advanced to regular diet with nutrition consult for calorie
   count.
   - continue Ensure tid and MVI daily
   - monitor po intake and see if she needs more supplemental nutrition.
   - check with psych regarding possibility of mirtazepine
   .
   *Activity- Changed from bedrest to activity with assistance and seemed
   ataxic per NSG.
   - PT consulted but pt was getting EEG, will see today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with recent Plasmodium falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. The patient's mental status has improved since admission, and broad differentials including cerebral malaria, seizure, meningoencephalitis, and toxic ingestion were considered. However, cerebral malaria is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of P. falciparum malaria and MRI findings consistent with infection/inflammation. A lumbar puncture did not suggest bacterial meningitis or tuberculosis meningitis. The patient's HIV status is unknown, although she tested negative two years ago according to friends.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Malaria: The patient has a history of P. falciparum malaria, and MRI findings suggest infection/inflammation. Cerebral malaria can cause severe neurological symptoms, including altered mental status and seizures.
2. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status may increase the risk of seizures, which can be monitored and managed with antiepileptic medications like phenytoin.
3. Hypoglycemia: Quinidine therapy can cause hypoglycemia, so the patient's blood glucose levels should be monitored regularly.
4. QT Prolongation: Quinidine can also cause QT prolongation on the electrocardiogram (EKG), so daily EKG monitoring is recommended.
5. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of P. falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental status. The patient's condition has improved since admission, and possible causes include cerebral malaria, seizure, meningoencephalitis, or toxic ingestion. However, cerebral malaria is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history and MRI findings. The patient's HIV status is unknown, although she tested negative two years ago. Toxic ingestion is less likely as tox screens were negative. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Malaria: The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest cerebral malaria, which can cause severe neurological complications.
2. Seizures: The patient may be at risk for seizures due to her altered mental status and potential cerebral malaria.
3. Hypoglycemia: Quinidine, the medication the patient is receiving, can cause hypoglycemia, so frequent fingerstick glucose monitoring is necessary.
4. QT Prolongation: Quinidine can also cause QT prolongation on EKG, so daily monitoring is required.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to hemolysis caused by parasites. Close monitoring of CBC and coagulation studies is necessary.
6. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts, and her poor appetite and low PO intake pose a risk for worsening depression. Psychiatric evaluation and treatment are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental status. The patient has a history of P. falciparum malaria and MRI findings consistent with infection/inflammation. The lumbar puncture did not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis. Toxic ingestion is less likely as tox screens were negative. The patient is currently on IV quinidine and PO doxy, with plans to finish IV quinidine by 11:59 PM on [**2184-7-20**]. HIV status is unknown, but the patient tested negative two years ago. The patient's fever has resolved, likely due to malaria. The patient also has anemia, depression, and a history of domestic abuse. She has been advanced to a regular diet and is being monitored for calorie count. The patient's activity level was increased from bedrest to assisted activity and she seemed ataxic. Further follow-up is recommended for ID and neuro consultations, pending CSF studies, EEG results, seizure precautions, and monitoring of Dilantin levels and albumin for correction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral malaria: The patient's altered mental status and history of P. falciparum malaria suggest the possibility of cerebral malaria. Close monitoring of neurological status and completion of appropriate antimalarial therapy are essential.

The patient is a 24-year-old female from [**Country 1773**] with a history of recent falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status and seizures. She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/47 to 105/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving IV gtt quinidine for malaria treatment. 

Lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.3 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 286 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 8 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's ECG shows no QTc prolongation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female from [**Country 1773**] with a history of recent falciparum malaria. She presented with altered mental status and seizures, presumed to be due to cerebral malaria. The patient has shown improvement in her mental status and has not experienced any further seizure activity. She is currently being treated with intravenous quinidine and doxycycline. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, including daily ECGs to track the QTc interval.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cerebral Malaria: The patient's altered mental status and seizures are likely due to cerebral malaria. It is crucial to continue managing this condition effectively to prevent further neurological complications.

2. Seizures: The patient has already experienced seizures, which could be a result of CSF infection or malaria. Close monitoring and appropriate seizure management should be continued to prevent recurrent seizures.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia has been attributed to malaria. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the anemia. Management should focus on treating the underlying cause and addressing the resulting symptoms.

4. Delirium or Depression: The patient's altered mental status may be complicated by delirium or depression. Psychological input and social work follow-up are recommended to address these potential issues.

5. Nutritional Support: The patient's poor oral intake needs to be addressed promptly. Encouraging oral intake and considering appetite stim"

   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 much imrpoved since admission. broad diff
   incl cerebral malaria, seizure, meningoencephalitis, toxic ingestion,
   but most likely cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P. falciparum malaria
   and MRI done demonstrates findings c/w infection/inflammation. LP did
   not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status unknown
   although pt negative 2 y ago per friends. Toxic ingestion less likely
   as tox screens were negative.

   - Follow parasite smears daily for now
   - f/u HIV (pt has already consented, HIV ordered)
   - Seizure precautions
   - F/U  EEG results, may have to repeat as likely suboptimal study (pt
   removed leads during study)
   - continue Dilantin for seizures, check daily Dilantin levels, check
   albumin for correction
   .
   * Fever
 Resolved. Most likely due to malaria.
   - Continue IV quinidine and IV doxy for now
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Hemolysis labs unremarkable but
   parasites can cause hct drop. Coags nl so DIC less likely.
   - Follow CBC
   - Fe studies, TSH, Vit B12, folate are all wnl
   - f/u Hb electropheresis
   .
   * Depression
 pt with h/o depression and suicide attempts. Also victim
   of domestic abuse.
   - f/u psych recs
   - given pt
s low PO intake and poor appetite, ask psych if mirtazipine
   is a good choice for her
   - Social work following
   - Screen visitors
   .
   *Nutrition- Advanced to regular diet with nutrition consult for calorie
   count.
   - continue Ensure tid and MVI daily
   - monitor po intake and see if she needs more supplemental nutrition.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 24F with recent falciparum malaria, presenting with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status
 much imrpoved since admission. broad diff
   incl cerebral malaria, seizure, meningoencephalitis, toxic ingestion,
   but most likely cerebral malaria as pt has h/o P. falciparum malaria
   and MRI done demonstrates findings c/w infection/inflammation. LP did
   not suggest bacterial meningitis or TB meningitis. HIV status unknown
   although pt negative 2 y ago per friends. Toxic ingestion less likely
   as tox screens were negative.
   - F/U ID and Neuro recs
   - d/c quinidine and doxy per ID recs
   - start 3d course of PO Malarone
   - F/u CSF studies
   - no more EKG daily since off quinidine
   - d/c fingerstick q4h as no more quinidine
   - continue parasite smears daily (last positive  was [**7-19**])
   - f/u HIV
   - Seizure precautions
   - F/U  EEG results, may have to repeat as likely suboptimal study (pt
   removed leads during study)
   - continue Dilantin for seizures, last level in therapeutic range
   .
   * Fever
 Resolved. Most likely due to malaria.
   - d/cIV quinidine and doxy
   - 3d of PO malarone
   - Follow up pending CSF Studies
   .
   * Anemia - Baseline Hct uncertain. Hemolysis labs unremarkable but
   parasites can cause hct drop. Coags nl so DIC less likely.
   - Follow CBC
   - Fe studies, TSH, Vit B12, folate are all wnl
   - f/u Hb electropheresis
   .
   * Depression
 pt with h/o depression and suicide attempts. Also victim
   of domestic abuse.
   - f/u psych recs
   - given pt
s low PO intake and poor appetite, ask psych if mirtazipine
   is a good choice for her
   - Social work following
   - Screen visitors
   .
   *Nutrition- Advanced to regular diet with nutrition consult for calorie
   count.
   - continue Ensure tid and MVI daily
   - po intake is improved
   - check with psych regarding possibility of mirtazipine
   .
   *Activity- Changed from bedrest to activity with assistance and seemed
   ataxic per NSG.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of P. falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status. The patient's symptoms have improved since admission, and broad differentials including cerebral malaria, seizure, meningoencephalitis, and toxic ingestion were considered. However, cerebral malaria is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of P. falciparum malaria and MRI findings consistent with infection/inflammation. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 90/51 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 70 bpm. The patient's weight is 57 kg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1,104 mL and output of 2,100 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -996 mL.

The patient has been treated with doxycycline and quinidine for 7 days, and it is planned to discontinue these medications in the morning of [**7-21**]. The patient will then be treated with 3 days of PO malarone to clear gametocytes. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, but hemolysis labs are unremarkable. The patient's electrolytes show a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, sodium level of 28 mEq/L, chloride level of 106"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female from Country 1773 with a history of recent falciparum malaria presenting with altered mental status and seizures, likely due to CNS malaria. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/60 mmHg to 73/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently alert and oriented, with normal tone and attentive to verbal stimuli.

The patient has completed courses of IV quinidine and doxycycline and is now receiving a 3-day course of malarone. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 346 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose level of 126 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension overnight, but it resolved with fluid bolus. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and provide appropriate fluid resuscitation if necessary.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status due to cerebral malaria. Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and providing appropriate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female from [Country 1773] who presented with altered mental status and seizures due to probable cerebral malaria. The patient has completed courses of quinidine and doxycycline, and will finish a three-day course of Malarone. Her vital signs are stable, with normal blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient remains alert and follows simple commands. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, and electrolyte levels are slightly imbalanced. The patient has anemia, but hemoglobin electrophoresis is pending. Imaging and microbiology tests are also pending. The patient's mental status continues to improve, and there has been no further seizure activity. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Malaria: The patient initially presented with altered mental status and seizures due to probable cerebral malaria. Monitoring for any changes in mental status or further seizure activity is essential.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension, which resolved with fluid administration. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure hemodynamic stability.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which has been attributed in part to malaria. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of anemia, and ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin levels is essential"
