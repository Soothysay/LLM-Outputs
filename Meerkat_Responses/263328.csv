","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history, including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presented with worsening respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU.

The patient has been receiving treatment for presumed pneumonia with COPD flare, including broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) due to his history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in sputum. High-dose corticosteroids have also been administered. Nebulizers, incentive spirometry, and suctioning have been used to manage his respiratory condition.

The patient's lower extremity erythema and edema are being monitored. The erythema appears chronic and not warm, tender, or blanching, suggesting that it may not be cellulitis. However, the patient is on vancomycin for pneumonia, so coverage is being provided regardless. Compression stockings and leg elevation are recommended for the edema, which could be due to venous insufficiency or possibly deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further workup, such as lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI), will be considered if there is no improvement on antibiotics.

The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes are believed to be due to demand secondary to his cardiac event. Aspirin and close monitoring for changes will be continued.

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history, including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presented with worsening respiratory distress over the past three days. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, including coverage for MRSA and MDR pseudomonas. High-dose corticosteroids have also been administered.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/68 to 128/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a tracheal mask. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,080 mL in and 630 mL out since 12 AM, with total intake of 1,080 mL, including 740 mL by mouth and 340 mL intravenously. The patient has received a total of 1,080 mL of fluids, with 630 mL output, including 460 mL of urine.

The patient's physical examination reveals moderate respiratory distress, markedly kyphotic posture, rhonchi, mildly prolonged expiratory phase, poor air movement, decreased at bases, no crackles, no appreciable egophony, tachyc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted for worsening secretion volume and multisegmental collapse contributing to rapid worsening of oxygenation and persistent respiratory distress. The patient has been supported with conservative measures including incentive spirometry, out-of-bed chair positioning, empiric antibiotics, and increased steroid dose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and recurrent collapse of lower lobe segments may lead to ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Ventilatory Support: The need for ventilatory support has been discussed with the patient, and currently, the patient is being managed with a non-cuffed tracheostomy and attempted use of the mechanical in-exsufflator (MIE) trial.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem) for suspected infection, indicating a risk of ongoing or recurrent infections.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility (out-of-bed to chair positioning).
5. Stress Ulcer: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, indicating a risk of stress-related gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
7. Glycemic Control: The patient's glycemic control"

   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. with normal free wall
   contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-6-9**], there is
   now moderate pulmonary hypertension detected.

   # Respiratory distress: Treating for presumed bronchitis with COPD
   flare.  Patient with occasional desatts at night.  He does appear to
   have some volume overload but it is not clear if he is having fluid
   build up in his lungs.  This is more likely mucous plugging with some
   collapse in the setting of bronchitis and COPD.  PE on the differential
   however there are currently other reasons for respiratory distress and
   tachycardia.
   -Broad coverage antibiotics given pt's history of MRSA and MDR
   pseudomonas in sputum, meropenem and vancomycin
   -High dose corticosteroids, on Prednisone 60mg.
   -standing and prn nebulizers, consider saline nebs to loosen
   secretions.
   -Aggressive incentive spirometry, pt's severe pain and brittle
   osteoporosis prohibit chest PT.
   -Q1 suctioning
   -F/u sputum and blood cultures
   -To consider changing trach to trach with cuff to start patient on
   pressure support.
   .
   # LE erythema: Appears to be chronic, and per patient has worsened with
   need to sit up to sleep with leg dangling. On exam erythema is not
   warm, tender or blanching.
   -leg elevation. Will consider compression stockings.
   -do not feel this is cellulitis based on exam, however is on vanc for
   PNA so should cover regardless.

   # LE edema: Unclear etiology, TTE from [**2124**] without significant RV or
   LV failure. [**Month (only) 60**] be dependent edema/venous insufficency, new RV failure
   in setting of probably increased pulmonary hypertension, new LV failure
   due to recent cardiac event (although would expect higher BNP), DVT.
   Will consider further workup if not improving on ABX.  Next step would
   be LENI
   -TTE in am
   -hold off on further diuresis given likely infectious process, pt does
   not otherwise look overloaded.
   -leg elevation.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presents with worsening respiratory distress over the past three days. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypertension. His oxygen saturation is at 94% on a tracheal mask. The patient is experiencing moderate respiratory distress with markedly kyphotic posture, rhonchi, wheezes, and poor breath sounds. There is no appreciable egophony, crackles, or signs of rebound or guarding in the abdomen. 

On examination, the patient has right greater than left pitting edema to the knee, right lower extremity erythema that is not warm or blanching, and mild distention with bowel sounds present. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated glucose levels, and elevated potassium levels. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. 

An echocardiogram reveals a normal-sized left atrium, no atrial septal defect, normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function with an ejection fraction greater than 55%. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and no structural abnormalities in the aortic or mitral valves. 

The patient has been diagnosed with presumed bronchitis with a COPD flare and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA"

   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. with normal free wall
   contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-6-9**], there is
   now moderate pulmonary hypertension detected.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history, including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presents with worsening respiratory distress over the past three days. 

The patient is currently being treated for presumed bronchitis with COPD flare, and there are occasional desaturations at night. It is noted that he has some volume overload but it is unclear if he is experiencing fluid buildup in his lungs. This could be due to mucous plugging with some collapse in the setting of bronchitis and COPD. However, there are other reasons for respiratory distress and tachycardia as well.

The patient has received broad coverage antibiotics due to his history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in sputum, with meropenem and vancomycin being administered. High-dose corticosteroids have been started on Prednisone 60mg, and the patient has requested a switch to solumedrol. 

Other interventions include standing and prn nebulizers, consideration of saline nebs to loosen secretions, aggressive incentive spirometry (though limited by severe pain and brittle osteoporosis), q1 suctioning, and follow-up sputum and blood cultures. The patient is also on MIE (likely mechanical inhaled exhalation) therapy.

The patient has chronic left leg erythema, which appears to have wors"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted with worsening hypoxemia and respiratory distress. He has shown slow improvement in consolidations and stabilization of hypoxemia with conservative treatment, including MIE (Manual Inhaled Expectorant) therapy and tracheostomy suctioning. The patient has received empiric antibiotics and systemic steroid dosing. His respiratory failure is secondary to severe underlying lung disease and intermittent collapse, with subjective improvement seen with supportive care. The plan includes continuing with ABX (antibiotics), MIE, tracheostomy oxygen, nebulizers, and switching to Solumedrol IV for pain control. The patient will require continued ICU support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe lung disease, along with intermittent collapse, puts him at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of lung sounds and sputum culture may be needed.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
4. Infection: The patient is already on empiric antibiotics, but there is still a risk"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history, including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presented with worsening respiratory distress over the past three days.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/88 to 130/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilatory support.

The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His ABG results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 76 mmHg, PaO2 of 186 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The FiO2 is set at 50%.

Physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress, markedly kyphotic posture, rhonchi and wheezes with a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, poor breath sounds throughout, decreased at bases, tachycardia, and regular heart rhythm. The abdomen appears protuberant with bowel sounds present. There is pitting edema to the knee on the right leg, along with pretibial erythema that is not warm and non-blanching.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, decreased sodium, and normal glucose levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history, including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presented with 3 days of worsening respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in his sputum, so broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) have been started. He also has leg erythema and edema, which may be chronic and related to venous insufficiency, but further workup is needed to rule out DVT. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, likely due to a recent cardiac event. Other comorbidities include diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Infection: The presence of broad-spectrum antibiotics suggests concern for hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Regular assessment of sputum and blood cultures is necessary.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's leg erythema and edema raise suspicion for DVT. Further workup, including lower extremity venous ultrasound, is needed to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for possible bronchial infection and suspected mucus plugging. The patient has persistent and significant hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may have been exacerbated by sedating effects of narcotic medications. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is expected to undergo weaning off the ventilator today with a tracheostomy mask trial. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type II and acute/chronic pain from a severe compression fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has severe hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further respiratory compromise during the weaning process from mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at increased risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, particularly in the lower extremities.
4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: Prolonged critical illness and sedation can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcers.
5. Diabetes Management: The patient has type II diabetes, and maintaining glycemic control in the ICU setting can be challenging.

   Assessment and Plan
   53M with complicated pulmonary history including COPD, tracheomalacia,
   diaphragmatic paralysis and chronic RLL collapse presenting with 3 days
   worsening respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Treating for presumed bronchitis with COPD
   flare.  He does appear to have some volume overload but it is not clear
   if he is having fluid build up in his lungs.  This is more likely
   mucous plugging with some collapse in the setting of bronchitis and
   COPD.  PE on the differential however there are currently other reasons
   for respiratory distress and tachycardia.  Patient started on vent
   overnight, respiratory was unable to get a RSBI as patient apneic.
   -Broad coverage antibiotics given pt's history of MRSA and MDR
   pseudomonas in sputum, meropenem and vancomycin
   -High dose corticosteroids, (solumedrol)
   -standing and prn nebulizers, consider saline nebs to loosen
   secretions.
   -Aggressive incentive spirometry, pt's severe pain and brittle
   osteoporosis prohibit chest PT.
   -Q1 suctioning
   -F/u sputum and blood cultures
   -Will try pressure support, then trach mask and continue with MIE
   # LE erythema: Appears to be chronic, and per patient has worsened with
   need to sit up to sleep with leg dangling. On exam erythema is not
   warm, tender or blanching.
   -leg elevation. Will consider compression stockings.
   -do not feel this is cellulitis based on exam, however is on vanc for
   PNA so should cover regardless.
   # LE edema: Unclear etiology, TTE from [**2124**] without significant RV or
   LV failure. [**Month (only) 60**] be dependent edema/venous insufficency, new RV failure
   in setting of probably increased pulmonary hypertension, new LV failure
   due to recent cardiac event (although would expect higher BNP), DVT.
   Will consider further workup if not improving on ABX.  Next step would
   be LENI
   -TTE in am
   -hold off on further diuresis given likely infectious process, pt does
   not otherwise look overloaded.
   -leg elevation.
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: Appears to be demand as mentioned above.
   He received aspirin and CE were not increasing.
   -Continue aspirin and monitor for changes
   # DM:
   -FSBS, diabetic diet, HISS
   # Osteoporosis:
   -Calcium, vitamin D
   # FEN/Lytes: Cardiac, diabetic diet, replete lytes prn, bolus prn for

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history, including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse.
- He presented with 3 days of worsening respiratory distress.
- The patient has been treated for presumed bronchitis with COPD flare, and volume overload is suspected but not confirmed.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated due to the patient's history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in sputum.
- High-dose corticosteroids have been given, and incentive spirometry is being used.
- The patient's leg erythema appears chronic and is associated with leg edema.
- There is a concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or venous insufficiency.
- Elevated cardiac enzymes suggest myocardial injury, but this may be secondary to the patient's underlying cardiac conditions.
- The patient has diabetes and osteoporosis.
- ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's worsening respiratory distress could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The presence of broad-spectrum antibiotics indicates a concern for bacterial infection. If the patient develops resistance or an ineffective antibiotic regimen"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presented with 3 days of worsening respiratory distress and is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, hypernatremia, lower extremity erythema and edema, diabetes mellitus, back pain, restless legs, and osteoporosis. The assessment and plan include treating presumed bronchitis with COPD flare, continuing broad coverage antibiotics due to his history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in sputum, and tapering high-dose corticosteroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening condition indicate a risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as mechanical ventilation if necessary, are crucial.

2. Infection: Given the patient's history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in sputum, there is a high risk of infection. It is essential to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for any signs of infection.

3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,632 mL and output of 800 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 832 mL. This suggests the possibility of fluid overload. Careful monitoring and adjustment of fluid administration are"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8911**]
 note and I agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 6115**] had severe hypoxic
   and hypercarbic COPD, compounded by steroid induced osteoporosis and
   compression spine fractures requiring narcotics for pain relief.  He is
   improving from a COPD exacerbation caused by a lower respiratory tract
   infection, but pain relief that is too strong results in somnolence and
   the need for mechanical ventilation.  Our goal is to slowly taper
   steroids, continue aggressive nebs, continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics, and increase free water to reduce his hypenatremia and
   allow thinner secretions.  The patient appears to have disabling
   restless leg syndrome and we will re introduce his Mirapex.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, chronic right lower lobe collapse, and diabetes mellitus. He presented with respiratory distress and was found to have mucous plugging with collapse in the setting of bronchitis and COPD. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) for suspected MRSA and MDR pseudomonas infection, high-dose corticosteroids, and bronchodilators.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient presented with worsening respiratory distress, which has improved significantly after treatment with antibiotics, steroids, and bronchodilators. The main concern is mucous plugging leading to collapse, but other causes like pulmonary embolism (PE) are less likely at this point.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a slight elevation in serum sodium levels (148), likely due to poor oral intake and insensible losses from respiration/infection. Encouraging free water intake is recommended to correct this.

3. Leg erythema and edema: The patient has chronic leg erythema and edema, which are likely due to prolonged bed rest and not indicative of cellulitis. However, coverage for possible cellulitis is being provided due to the presence of infection. Leg elevation and outpatient Lasix are advised.

4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has diabetes, and his diabetic diet and HISS should continue. No specific complications related to diabetes are mentioned in the note.

5. Back pain: The patient has chronic back pain, which is compounded by compression fractures and sedentary/bedridden status. Encouraging out-of-bed activities and continuing pain management with morphine IR and Oxycodone prn is recommended.

6. Restless legs: The patient has restless leg syndrome, previously treated with Mirapex. The medication will be restarted today.

7. Osteoporosis: The patient has osteoporosis, likely exacerbated by steroid use. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation, as well as oral bisphosphonates (Fosamax), are recommended to manage this condition.

8. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient may have imbalances due to hypotension and low urine output. Bolus administration of fluids and electrolytes as needed is advised.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to further mucous plugging or infection, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization, and worsening hypernatremia if oral intake remains poor."

   flare.  Has volume overload but not thought to be significantly
   affecting resp function at this time. This is more likely mucous
   plugging with collapse in the setting of bronchitis and COPD; improving
   with steroids/bronchodilators and empiric abx.
   -Continue broad coverage antibiotics given his h/o MRSA and MDR
   pseudomonas in sputum, meropenem and vancomycin x8

   We will reduce his steroid dose and change to po prednisone.  Plan is
   for an 8 day course of Meropenem and Vanco for pneumonia complicated by
   COPD flare.  He should be ready to return to rehab/chronic care setting
   by tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a complicated pulmonary history, including COPD, tracheomalacia with tracheal stent removal, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presented with 3 days of worsening respiratory distress and was initially treated for presumed bronchitis with a COPD flare. The patient appears to have some volume overload but it is unclear if he has fluid build-up in his lungs. It is more likely mucous plugging with collapse in the setting of bronchitis and COPD. The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly after treatment with antibiotics and bronchodilators. He is currently on broad coverage antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) due to his history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in sputum, as well as high-dose corticosteroids which will be tapered from 20 mg q8h to 15 mg q8h. The patient is also receiving aggressive incentive spirometry, q1h suctioning, and tracheostomy care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with worsening respiratory distress, which is a concern for potential exacerbation of his underlying respiratory conditions such as COPD and tracheomalacia. Close monitoring and continued treatment with bronchodilators and antibiotics are necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Volume Overload: The patient may have some volume overload,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a complicated pulmonary history, including COPD, tracheomalacia, tracheal stent removal, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presented with worsening respiratory distress and was treated for presumed bronchitis with COPD flare. The patient has volume overload but it is not significantly affecting respiratory function at this time. He is improving with steroids/bronchodilators and empiric antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of COPD and tracheomalacia, which can contribute to respiratory distress. The use of bronchodilators and steroids is helping to improve his condition. However, there is a risk of further exacerbation of his respiratory symptoms if not properly managed.

2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to his history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in sputum. There is a potential risk of antibiotic resistance or treatment failure if the antibiotics are not appropriate for the specific infection.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient had a sight hypernatremia yesterday, which is now resolved. It was likely secondary to poor oral intake in the setting of insensible losses from respiration/infection. Encouraging free water intake is important to prevent dehydration.

4. Lower extremity erythema and edema: Both appear to be chronic and not warm, tender, or blanching"

   diaphragmatic paralysis and chronic RLL collapse presenting with 3 days
   of worsening respiratory distress.

   flare.  Has volume overload but not thought to be significantly
   affecting resp function at this time. This is more likely mucous
   plugging with collapse in the setting of bronchitis and COPD; improving
   with steroids/bronchodilators and empiric abx.
   -Continue broad coverage antibiotics given his h/o MRSA and MDR
   pseudomonas in sputum, meropenem and vancomycin x8

   Assessment and Plan
   A 53 year-old man with complicated pulmonary history including COPD,
   tracheomalacia s/p tracheal stent (removed) and tracheostomy,
   diaphragmatic paralysis and chronic RLL collapse presenting with 3 days
   of worsening respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: treating for presumed bronchitis with COPD
   flare.  Has volume overload but not thought to be significantly
   affecting resp function at this time. This is more likely mucous
   plugging with collapse in the setting of bronchitis and COPD; improving
   with steroids/bronchodilators and empiric abx.  Recent tightness is
   likely persistent COPD flare.
   -continue broad antibiotics given his h/o MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in
   sputum, meropenem and vancomycin (d1 = [**5-7**])
   -continue prednisone 60mg will taper when clinically improved
   -standing and prn nebs
   -aggressive incenitve spirometry
   -continue trach mask
   # Back pain: chronic, d/t compression fractures compounded by
   sedentary/bed-ridden status
   -encourage OOB to chair
   -continue morphine IR and Oxycodone prn; avoid escalating dose as
   respiratory status worsens with increased sedation
   -avoiding intravenous narcotics as patient is currently tolerating pos
   # Restless legs: reviewed rehab notes and patient was on Mirapex before
   this admission; restarted with subj improvement
   -will continue Mirapex 0.25 qhs
   # Hypernatremia: now resolved.  likely secondary to poor po intake in
   setting of insensible losses from respiration/infection.
   -encourage free water intake as needed.
   # LE erythema and edema: both appear to be chronic. On exam erythema is
   not warm, tender or blanching.  TTE showed normal EF with moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   -leg elevation.
   -do not feel this is cellulitis based on exam, however is on vanc for

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of complicated pulmonary issues, including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presented with worsening respiratory distress over the past three days. The patient has been treated for presumed bronchitis with COPD flare and is currently improving. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, bronchodilators, and supportive care such as nebulizers and spirometry. The patient also has chronic back pain due to compression fractures, restless legs syndrome, resolved hypernatremia, lower extremity erythema and edema with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's primary concern is respiratory distress, likely due to mucous plugging and collapse in the setting of bronchitis and COPD. Close monitoring and aggressive interventions like nebulizers and spirometry are being implemented to manage this condition.

2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to his history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in the sputum. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or adverse drug reactions with prolonged antibiotic use.

3. Fluid Overload: Although not significantly affecting respiratory function at the moment, the patient has volume overload. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure if not properly managed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with severe COPD who was admitted with progressive respiratory distress and required intermittent nocturnal ventilation. He has been maintained off the ventilator for the past 24 hours. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type II, back pain secondary to a compression fracture, and impaired gas exchange. 

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, a blood pressure within normal limits, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on the tracheal mask. His temperature is slightly elevated. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) for pneumonia, steroids for COPD flare-ups, and pain management.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Other lab results show slightly elevated potassium and creatinine levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and progressive respiratory distress put him at risk for respiratory failure. Ongoing management of his underlying issues such as COPD flare-ups and pneumonia will be crucial in preventing further respiratory deterioration.

2. Pneumonia: The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, which indicates an active infection. Failure to adequately treat the infection may lead to worsening pneumonia and respiratory distress.

3. Diabetic Complications: As the patient has type"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 53 year-old man with complicated pulmonary history including COPD,
   tracheomalacia s/p tracheal stent (removed) and tracheostomy,
   diaphragmatic paralysis and chronic RLL collapse presenting with 3 days
   of worsening respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: treating for presumed bronchitis with COPD
   flare.  Has volume overload but not thought to be significantly
   affecting resp function at this time. This is more likely mucous
   plugging with collapse in the setting of bronchitis and COPD; improving
   with steroids/bronchodilators and empiric abx.  Recent tightness is
   likely persistent COPD flare.
   -continue broad antibiotics given his h/o MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in
   sputum, meropenem and vancomycin (d1 = [**5-7**])
   -will Currently on Solumedrol.  Will attempt to change back to
   prednisone.
   -standing and prn nebs
   -aggressive incenitve spirometry
   -continue trach mask
   # Back pain: chronic, d/t compression fractures compounded by
   sedentary/bed-ridden status
   -encourage OOB to chair
   -continue morphine IR and Oxycodone prn; avoid escalating dose as
   respiratory status worsens with increased sedation
   -avoiding intravenous narcotics as patient is currently tolerating pos
   # Restless legs: reviewed rehab notes and patient was on Mirapex before
   this admission; restarted with subj improvement
   -will continue Mirapex 0.25 qhs
   # Hypernatremia: now resolved.  likely secondary to poor po intake in
   setting of insensible losses from respiration/infection.
   -encourage free water intake as needed.
   # LE erythema and edema: both appear to be chronic. On exam erythema is
   not warm, tender or blanching.  TTE showed normal EF with moderate
   pulmonary artery hypertension.
   -leg elevation.
   -do not feel this is cellulitis based on exam, however is on vanc for

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old man with a complicated pulmonary history, including COPD, tracheomalacia, diaphragmatic paralysis, and chronic right lower lobe collapse. He presented with worsening respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's pain control has been increased, and he has been started on steroids and bronchodilators for presumed bronchitis with a COPD flare. He is currently on broad antibiotics due to his history of MRSA and MDR pseudomonas in his sputum, specifically meropenem and vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/67 to 119/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92% on tracheal mask. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient has shown improvement overall, reporting that he is not yet at his baseline. Physical examination reveals decreased wheezes and a prolonged expiratory phase, trace pitting edema bilaterally with dependent rubor in the lower extremities, and severe kyphosis. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests show normal creatinine and potassium levels. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within normal"

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has severe COPD and is currently experiencing improvement in hypercarbic respiratory failure with systemic steroids and intermittent ventilatory support. The patient is also dealing with pain control, as there is a delicate balance between adequate pain control and over sedation/respiratory suppression.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/57 mmHg to 119/80 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is thin, with distant heart sounds and wheezing breath sounds on chest examination. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. However, movement, tone, and skin assessments were not performed.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, while creatinine, potassium, and sodium levels are slightly elevated. Other lab values such as C-reactive protein, troponin-T, and lactic acid are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes severe COPD, hypercarbic respiratory failure, diabetes"
