   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure.  Seems to
   have subacute process with acute decompensation.  Given history,
   concern for neuromuscular process.  Also was a smoker and has some
   hyperinflation of R lung on CXR.  Acute decompensation may be related
   to aspiration.
      -Continue low tidal volume ventilation
      -Check airways resistance and NIF
      -Will review OSH films to assess pulmonary vasculature and
   parenchyma.
      -Given no fevers, leukocytosis or secretions, holding on abx for
   now.
   WEAKNESS, CLONUS -- unclear whether current constellation of signs and
   symptoms consitent with Parkinson's DIsease or other neurodegenerative
   process or paraneoplastic manifestation.  Doubt ALS in absence of
   fasciculations.
     -Neuro consult when his sedation is lightened and he is able to be
   examined reliably
   ACID/BASE:  Metabolic alkalosis suggestive of both mild volume
   contraction and subacute hypoventilation.
      -Mild hydration.
      -Will target a normal pH with the ventilator rather than a normal
   CO2
   Renal Failure:  Baseline Cr < 1.0, now 1.3.  Likely prerenal
      -Hydration as above.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- weight loss may reflect reduced PO intake, but
   may also reflect underlying malignancy or degenerative state.
   Nutitional assessment.  Plan initiate tube feeds via NGT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of lethargy and respiratory failure. He has a history of Parkinson's disease and was previously admitted for respiratory failure in late 2139. The patient is intubated and on invasive ventilation, with a current arterial blood gas showing metabolic alkalosis, hypoxemia, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 94/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and follows commands, with crackles heard bilaterally on lung auscultation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The assessment includes respiratory failure with concerns for a neuromuscular process or aspiration, weakness and clonus possibly related to Parkinson's disease or another neurodegenerative process, metabolic alkalosis, and renal failure. The plan includes continuing low tidal volume ventilation, checking airways resistance and NIF, reviewing OSH films, holding antibiotics, obtaining a neurology consult, providing mild hydration, targeting normal pH with the ventilator, initiating nutritional support, and monitoring for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient is critically ill."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, primarily ventilatory failure. He has a history of Parkinson's disease and was previously admitted in late 2139 for respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's subacute decline in functional status, failure to thrive (FTT), and movement over the last 3-4 months was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease by a neurologist. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedated.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C, heart rate 83 bpm, blood pressure 94/40 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on supplemental oxygen. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 958 mL since midnight.

The patient has crackles bilaterally with diminished breath sounds on the left base, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and absent peripheral pulses. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.7 g/dL, slightly elevated platelet count (Plt) of 160 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) of 29.0%, and normal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure - predominately ventilatory failure, subacute process with acute decompensation, concern for neuromuscular process, possibly aspiration-related. Continue low tidal volume ventilation, check air"

   77 yo M with acute mixed respiratory failure in setting of recent
   hypercarbic resp failure with asp PNA and subacute cognitive decline
   with recent diagnosis of PD.
   #) MIXED RESPIRATORY FAILURE, VENTILLATORY > HYPOXIC:
   Based on OSH CT scan, looks like aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia in
   setting of somnolence and h/o dysphagia; no evidence of PE on CTA.
   Also possibly NM weakness is contributing.  Unclear why oxygenating
   well here, so likely more hypercarbic in nature.  Small effusion on
   left on CT scan.  Has 50 pack year smoking hx per family
   -- looked at [**Last Name (un) **] CT scan, need to have uploaded into our system
   -- albuterol PRN for wheezing
   -- continue vent support, 400 x 16 while on AC, but tolerated PS most
   of day
   -- started vanco/zosyn emperically for aspiration pna; relative
   leukocytosis (pt with baseline leukopenia), sputum
   -- sent sputum, blood, urine cultures [**2141-1-29**]
   #) LETHARGY: unclear whether [**2-27**] to meds (Mirapex) or hypoxia/resp
   status; head CT negative at OSH.  Did not appear somnolent off sedation
   [**2140-1-29**]
   -- cont holding Mirapex
   #) PARKINSON'S DISEASE, WEAKNESS:  recent dx of PD, though course seems
   somewhat rapid for PD.  Unclear if some other neurodegenrative process
   is occuring.
   -- will cont holding Mirapex for now
   -- consider neurology consult while off sedation
   #) METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: likely from volume depletion, contraction
   alkalosis, chronic compensation for resp acidosis
   -- ph normalized
   -- monitor
   #) ? ARF: basline renal fx normal on OSH labs. Resolved with IVFs,
   likely was prerenal
   -- Received IVFs
   -- Now on TFs
   #) HTN: on home lisinopril; restarted captopril o/n, but discontinued
   it when he became hypotensive on propofol
   -- will hold ACEI and amlodipine while potential need for propofol
   #) ? BPH HISTORY:
   -- cont home terazosin 10 mg QHS
   #) WEIGHT LOSS: has had 30 pound weight loss in last 3-4 months;
   unclear if [**2-27**] behavior/PD-related problems or malignancy.
   -- nutrition consult, tube feeds
   -- further work-up as above
   #) FEN: will begin tube feeds while intubated, nutrition consult; IVF
   PRN; replet lytes as needed.
   #) PROTEINURIA: possible [**2-27**] IgA gammopathy
   -- monitor renal function; work-up as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with acute mixed respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and subacute cognitive decline. He has a history of Parkinson's disease and a 50 pack-year smoking history. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam empirically for aspiration pneumonia. His vital signs are stable, but he experienced a cardiac event overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of dysphagia and recent aspiration event increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. The current treatment plan includes antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) to address this possibility.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient is on contact precautions due to MRSA colonization, which may further increase the risk of VAP.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive on propofol and captopril. Monitoring blood pressure closely is important to avoid hypoperfusion and organ damage.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has a history of chronic compensation for respiratory acidosis, which could have led to metabolic alkalosis. Monitoring and correcting electrolyte imbalances are essential.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with acute mixed respiratory failure, recent hypercarbic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, subacute cognitive decline, and a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. He has a history of smoking and is currently intubated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of dysphagia, somnolence, and aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia seen on CT scan puts him at risk for further aspiration events, leading to worsening respiratory status.
2. Ventilatory failure: The patient's mixed respiratory failure indicates a combination of hypoventilation and hypoxia. If not properly managed, this could result in progressive respiratory distress and potential need for more aggressive ventilatory support.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and rapid progression raise concerns for potential neurological complications such as worsening motor symptoms or development of additional neurodegenerative processes.
4. Infection: The patient has been empirically started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring of sputum, blood, and urine cultures is important to identify any potential infectious agents and guide antibiotic therapy.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's metabolic alkalosis and resolved acute kidney injury suggest an imbalance in fluid and electrolytes. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are crucial to prevent further complications.
6. Hypotension: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure.  Seems to
   have subacute process with acute decompensation.  Given history,
   concern for neuromuscular process.  Also was a smoker and had airway
   resistance >20 yesterday.  Acute decompensation likely related to
   aspiration.
     -Wean PS today as able.
     -Check NIF
    -Vanco/Zosyn added yesterday given relative leukocytosis, secretions
   and infiltrates on OSH CT.
    -F/u Sputum Cultures
    -Continue standing bronchodilators
    [**Name (NI) 4807**] unclear whether current constellation of signs and symptoms
   consistent with Parkinson's DIsease or other neurodegenerative process
   or paraneoplastic manifestation.  Doubt ALS in absence of
   fasciculations.
     -Neuro consult when his sedation is lightened and he is able to be
   examined reliably
    ACID/BASE:  Metabolic alkalosis suggestive of both mild volume
   contraction and subacute hypoventilation.
     -Mild hydration/TF
     -Will target a normal pH with the ventilator rather than a normal CO2
    Renal Failure:  Baseline Cr < 1.0, now 1.0.  Likely prerenal and
   resolved
      -Hydration as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently in the ICU. The patient has respiratory failure, predominantly ventilatory failure, with a possible underlying neuromuscular process or aspiration. The patient's current condition is being managed with weaning of PS (positive end-expiratory pressure), checking NIF (neuromuscular inhibitory factors), and administering Vanco/Zosyn (antibiotics) due to relative leukocytosis, secretions, and infiltrates on OSH CT (computed tomography scan).

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis suggestive of mild volume contraction and subacute hypoventilation. Renal failure has been resolved, and the patient's renal function has returned to baseline. The patient's nutrition is being provided through Nutren 2.0 at a rate of 30 mL/hour, and their glycemic control is well-managed.

The patient has multiple lines, including arterial, peripheral, and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as DVT (deep vein thrombosis) prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prevention are in place. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress further if ventilatory support is not adequately maintained or if there is an underlying neuromuscular process that worsens.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure.  Seems to
   have subacute process with acute decompensation.  Given history,
   concern for neuromuscular process.  Also was a smoker and had airway
   resistance >20 yesterday.  Acute decompensation likely related to
   aspiration.
     -Wean PS today as able.
     -Check NIF
    -Vanco/Zosyn added yesterday given relative leukocytosis, secretions
   and infiltrates on OSH CT.
    -F/u Sputum Cultures
    -Continue standing bronchodilators
    [**Name (NI) 4807**] unclear whether current constellation of signs and symptoms
   consistent with Parkinson's DIsease or other neurodegenerative process
   or paraneoplastic manifestation.  Doubt ALS in absence of
   fasciculations.
     -Neuro consult when his sedation is lightened and he is able to be
   examined reliably
    ACID/BASE:  Metabolic alkalosis suggestive of both mild volume
   contraction and subacute hypoventilation.
     -Mild hydration/TF
     -Will target a normal pH with the ventilator rather than a normal CO2
    Renal Failure:  Baseline Cr < 1.0, now 1.0.  Likely prerenal and
   resolved
      -Hydration as above.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, predominantly ventilatory failure. They have a history of smoking and airway resistance, suggesting a possible neuromuscular process. The acute decompensation is likely related to aspiration. The patient has been placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is being weaned as able. 

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, which is suggestive of mild volume contraction and subacute hypoventilation. Mild hydration and targeted normal pH with the ventilator are recommended.

Additionally, the patient has shown signs of renal failure, with a baseline creatinine level of less than 1.0 and now at 1.0. This is likely prerenal and has resolved. Hydration is advised.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through a Nutren 2.0 (Full) regimen at a rate of 30 mL/hour. Blood sugar levels are well-controlled.

Lines have been inserted, including a 22 gauge, 20 gauge, arterial line, and 18 gauge. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention through head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls.

The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU. The attending physician spent a total of 35 minutes with the patient."

   77 yo M with acute mixed respiratory failure in setting of recent
   hypercarbic resp failure with asp PNA and subacute cognitive decline
   with recent diagnosis of PD.
   #) MIXED RESPIRATORY FAILURE, VENTILLATORY > HYPOXIC:
   Based on OSH CT scan, looks like aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia in
   setting of somnolence and h/o dysphagia; no evidence of PE on CTA.
   Also possibly NM weakness is contributing.  Unclear why oxygenating
   well here, so likely more hypercarbic in nature.  Small effusion on
   left on CT scan.  Has 50 pack year smoking hx per family.  On minimal
   vent setting sthis morning but with poor NIF.
   -- will consider extubation this morning
   -- started vanco/zosyn emperically for aspiration pna; sputum growing
   pseudomonas sensitive to zosyn.  Will d/c vancomycin as no cx data
   supporting
   #) LETHARGY: unclear whether [**2-27**] to meds (Mirapex) or hypoxia/resp
   status; head CT negative at OSH.  Did not appear somnolent off sedation
   this morning.
   -- cont holding Mirapex; will discuss PD meds with neurology
   #) PARKINSON'S DISEASE, WEAKNESS:  recent dx of PD, though course seems
   somewhat rapid for PD.  Unclear if some other neurodegenrative process
   is occuring.  NIF weak but may be deconditioning vs. more chronic neuro
   process
   -- will cont holding Mirapex for now
   #) ARF: basline renal fx normal on OSH labs. Resolved with IVFs, likely
   was prerenal
   -- will place on gentle maintenance fluids if extubated today 9would
   wait to feed until S&S eval is completed)
   #) HTN: on home lisinopril; restarted captopril o/n, but discontinued
   it when he became hypotensive on propofol
   -- will restart lisinopril & amlodipine when taking PO
   -- will start metoprolol 5 mg IV Q6 while NPO and will up-titrate as
   needed
   #) ? BPH HISTORY:
   -- cont home terazosin 10 mg QHS when taking PO
s; foley for now; renal
   function improved with IVF, UOP remains good
   #) FEN, WEIGHT LOSS: has had 30 pound weight loss in last 3-4 months;
   unclear if [**2-27**] behavior/PD-related problems or malignancy.
   -- nutrition consult; holding tube feeds for now while planning
   extubation; will write for Ensure and high calorie diet when taking
   PO
   -- further work-up as above
   #) PROTEINURIA: possible [**2-27**] IgA gammopathy; renal function stable.
   -- monitor renal function; work-up as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with acute mixed respiratory failure, recent hypercarbic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, subacute cognitive decline, and a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. He has a history of dysphagia, smoking, and hypertension. The patient is currently intubated and on minimal ventilatory support. He has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam empirically for aspiration pneumonia, and the sputum is growing pseudomonas sensitive to zosyn. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 115/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. The patient has small effusions on his left chest, no evidence of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography, and an abnormal head computed tomography scan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mixed Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing both hypoxygenic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. It is unclear why he is oxygenating well, suggesting that the cause may be more hypercarbic in nature. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, likely due to his dys"

   77 yo M with acute mixed respiratory failure in setting of recent
   hypercarbic resp failure with asp PNA and subacute cognitive decline
   with recent diagnosis of PD.
   #) MIXED RESPIRATORY FAILURE, VENTILLATORY > HYPOXIC:
   Based on OSH CT scan, looks like aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia in
   setting of somnolence and h/o dysphagia; no evidence of PE on CTA.
   Also possibly NM weakness is contributing.  Unclear why oxygenating
   well here, so likely more hypercarbic in nature.  Small effusion on
   left on CT scan.  Has 50 pack year smoking hx per family
   -- looked at [**Last Name (un) **] CT scan, need to have uploaded into our system
   -- albuterol standing
   -- continue vent support, 400 x 16 while on AC, but can likely change
   back to pressure support
   -- started vanco/zosyn emperically for aspiration pna; relative
   leukocytosis (pt with baseline leukopenia), sputum
   -- f/u sputum (GPCs on gram stain), blood, urine cultures [**2141-1-29**]
   -- check NIF to see if neuromuscular weakness is contributing
   #) LETHARGY: unclear whether [**2-27**] to meds (Mirapex) or hypoxia/resp
   status; head CT negative at OSH.  Did not appear somnolent off sedation
   [**2140-1-29**]
   -- cont holding Mirapex
   #) PARKINSON'S DISEASE, WEAKNESS:  recent dx of PD, though course seems
   somewhat rapid for PD.  Unclear if some other neurodegenrative process
   is occuring.
   -- will cont holding Mirapex for now
   -- check NIF as above
   #) METABOLIC ALKALOSIS: likely from volume depletion, contraction
   alkalosis, chronic compensation for resp acidosis
   -- ph normalized
   -- monitor
   #) ? ARF: basline renal fx normal on OSH labs. Resolved with IVFs,
   likely was prerenal
   -- Received IVFs
   -- Now on TFs
   #) HTN: on home lisinopril; restarted captopril o/n, but discontinued
   it when he became hypotensive on propofol
   -- will hold ACEI and amlodipine while potential need for propofol

   #) WEIGHT LOSS: has had 30 pound weight loss in last 3-4 months;
   unclear if [**2-27**] behavior/PD-related problems or malignancy.
   -- nutrition consult, tube feeds
   -- further work-up as above
   #) FEN: will begin tube feeds while intubated, nutrition consult; IVF
   PRN; replet lytes as needed.
   #) PROTEINURIA: possible [**2-27**] IgA gammopathy

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with acute mixed respiratory failure in the setting of recent hypercarbic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and subacute cognitive decline with a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
- The patient's condition appears to be improving, as evidenced by stable vital signs and improved oxygenation.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation support.
- The patient has a history of smoking and Parkinson's disease, and is currently on Mirapex for Parkinson's disease.
- The patient's recent medical history includes weight loss, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and possible IgA gammopathy.
- The patient's labs show leukocytosis with relative leukopenia, elevated creatinine, and metabolic alkalosis.
- The patient is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam empirically for aspiration pneumonia.
- The patient's family has been informed about the situation and is involved in the decision-making process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily mouth care, and avoiding unnecessary procedures should be implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing D"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately ventilatory failure.  Seems to
   have subacute process with acute decompensation.  Given history and low
   NIF, concern for neuromuscular process.  Also was a smoker and had
   airway resistance >20 early in hospital course.  Acute decompensation
   likely related to aspiration.
     -Wean PS and attempt SBT.
     -PSA in sputum Cx.  Continue Zosyn, d/c Vancomycin
     -Continue standing bronchodilators
    [**Name (NI) 4807**] unclear whether current constellation of signs and symptoms
   consistent with Parkinson's DIsease or other neurodegenerative process
   or paraneoplastic manifestation.  Doubt ALS in absence of
   fasciculations.
     -Neuro consult when he is extubated to weigh in regarding treatment
   regimen for presumed PD.
    ACID/BASE:  Metabolic alkalosis suggestive of both mild volume
   contraction and subacute hypoventilation.
     -Mild hydration/TF
     -Will target a normal pH with the ventilator rather than a normal CO2

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of being a smoker and presented with respiratory failure, primarily ventilatory failure. The underlying cause of this respiratory failure is suspected to be a neuromuscular process or aspiration. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 66-115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/32-126/38 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's labs show normal levels for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. However, there is evidence of metabolic alkalosis and mild volume contraction. Imaging reveals an endotracheal tube in place and improvement in left-sided volume loss. The patient is being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, heparin sodium, and prevacid. The plan is to wean the patient off pressure support and attempt spontaneous breathing trials. A neurology consult has been requested to evaluate the patient for Parkinson's disease or other neurodegenerative processes once extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
      -- predominately ventilatory failure.  Seems to have subacute
   process with acute decompensation.  Given history and low NIF, concern
   for neuromuscular process.  Also was a smoker and had airway resistance
   >20 early in hospital course.  Acute decompensation likely related to
   aspiration.
     -Wean PS and attempt SBT.
     -PSA in sputum Cx.
                -Continue Zosyn
                - d/c Vancomycin
     -Continue standing bronchodilators
    WEAKNESS
      -- unclear whether current constellation of signs and symptoms
   consistent with Parkinson's DIsease or other neurodegenerative process
   or paraneoplastic manifestation.  Doubt ALS in absence of
   fasciculations.
     -Neuro consult when he is extubated to weigh in regarding treatment
   regimen for presumed PD.
    ACID/BASE:
      -Metabolic alkalosis suggestive of both mild volume contraction and
   subacute hypoventilation.
     -Mild hydration/TF
     -Will target a normal pH with the ventilator rather than a normal CO2
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's respiratory failure is predominately ventilatory failure, with a concern for a neuromuscular process, possibly aspiration. The plan is to wean the pressure support (PS) and attempt a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Antibiotics have been prescribed based on the sputum culture results.

The patient also presents with weakness, which could be consistent with Parkinson's Disease or another neurodegenerative process. A neurology consult will be sought once the patient is extubated to discuss the treatment regimen.

There is evidence of metabolic alkalosis due to volume contraction and subacute hypoventilation. Mild hydration and targeted ventilation management are recommended.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and various lines for monitoring and medication administration. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer protection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention are also in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Interventions such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and ensuring proper antibiotic coverage can help reduce this risk.
2. Barotrauma: The patient's high airway pressures and positive pressure ventilation may predispose them to barotrauma, which is lung injury caused by excessive pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of recent hypercarbic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia (asp PNA), subacute cognitive decline, Parkinson's disease (PD), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and significant weight loss. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute mixed respiratory failure and has since been extubated without respiratory compromise. 

During the night, the patient was placed on gentle maintenance fluids and had his arterial line removed. Non-invasive blood pressure measurements were significantly lower than those recorded from the arterial line. Metoprolol IV was up-titrated throughout the night. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and piperacillin. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) at 37.4°C (99.4°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) at 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate (HR) at 99 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal range of 73-115 bpm, blood pressure (BP) at 244/77 mmHg with a previous range of 132/37-244/77 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 37 inspiratory minutes with spontaneous RR at 14, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 98%.

- The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease.
- He presented to the hospital with respiratory failure, primarily ventilatory failure.
- The patient has a history of smoking and airway resistance >20 early in the hospital course.
- Acute decompensation was likely related to aspiration.
- The patient was successfully extubated yesterday.
- A-line pressures were noted to be about 30-50 points higher (systolics) than cuff pressures, and the A-line was eventually discontinued.
- The patient has been on various medications including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Hydralazine, Metoprolol, Heparin Sodium, Colace, Terazosin, Albuterol/Atrovent, and Lansoprazole.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/51 mmHg to 175/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, with symptoms of ventilatory failure and subacute process with acute decompensation. There is a concern for neuromuscular process due to the patient's history and low NIF (negative inspiratory force). The acute decompensation is likely related to aspiration. The patient has been extubated yesterday.

The patient's weakness is unclear whether it is consistent with Parkinson's Disease or other neurodegenerative process or paraneoplastic manifestation. There is doubt about ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) in the absence of fasciculations. A neuro consult has been requested today to question if this is indeed PD and what is the appropriate treatment regimen given the side effects with previous regimens.

The patient also has hypertension, which will be managed when able to take pills. In the meantime, IV's will continue. The remainder of the plan is as outlined in the resident note.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's critically ill condition and respiratory failure indicate a high risk for complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The presence of weakness and low NIF raises concern for neuromuscular disorders like ALS or PD. The patient's history of smoking and airway resistance also suggest a higher risk for respiratory complications. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Predominately ventilatory failure.  Seems to have
   subacute process with acute decompensation.  Given history and low NIF,
   concern for neuromuscular process.  Also was a smoker and had airway
   resistance >20 early in hospital course.  Acute decompensation likely
   related to aspiration. Extubated yesterday.
     -PSA and enterobacter in sputum Cx, change abx to cefepime to cover
   both.
     -Continue standing bronchodilators
    WEAKNESS
     -unclear whether current constellation of signs and symptoms
   consistent with Parkinson's DIsease or other neurodegenerative process
   or paraneoplastic manifestation.  Doubt ALS in absence of
   fasciculations.
     -Neuro consult today with question of if this is indeed PD and if so
   what is appropriate treatment regimen given side effects with previous
   regimens.
   HTN:  When able to take pills, will put on home po regimen, continue
   IV's in the meantime.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. The patient was extubated successfully yesterday and had an arterial line (A-line) that showed systolic pressures higher than cuff pressures. The A-line was eventually discontinued.

The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for a few noted changes. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/51 mmHg to 175/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is still receiving several medications, including hydralazine, metoprolol, heparin sodium, and others.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,668 mL, output of 1,328 mL, with a total positive balance of 877 mL since midnight. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a pressure support of 5 cmH2O and a spontaneous respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.32, indicating respiratory acidosis.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, diminished breath sounds at the bases, and poor inspiratory effort"
