","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 117/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 473 mL.

24-hour events include invasive ventilation started at 10:20 AM, endoscopy performed at 04:00 PM, and paracentesis done at 06:47 PM.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (not ARDS) with the patient being intubated for airway protection. The plan is to keep the patient off sedation and consider extubation if the patient wakes up. If agitation occurs, low-dose haloperidol can be used.

The patient also has a history of trauma with a false urethral tract, for which ceftriaxone (CFTX) is being continued and discussed with urology.

Hypotension not related to shock has resolved, and aldactone is restarted. The patient's altered mental status is attributed to hepatic enceph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient was agitated in the morning and received 7mg of Versed before being switched to propofol. The patient underwent invasive ventilation, endoscopy, and paracentesis. The patient has a history of celiac sprue and allergies to gluten. The patient is currently on multiple medications including propofol, lactulose, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/67 to 138/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received a total of 1,727 mL of fluid input and 2,200 mL of fluid output, with a balance of -473 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 669 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory support parameters are within normal limits, with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 29 and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 10 cmH"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of altered mental status, chronic anemia, hypotension, and trauma. He was intubated on [date] at 02:40 PM and extubated in the morning once diazepam wore off. The patient is receiving treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with ceftriaxone and albumin. He has a Foley catheter inserted and will be monitored closely. Social work consult has been requested, and the patient's sister is reluctant to have a hospice consult. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/60 mmHg to 92/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 50%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.18, indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,525 mL and output of 2,030 mL, with a negative balance of 505 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood glucose level is well-controlled. The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of trauma, chronic anemia, and altered mental status. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been receiving treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with ceftriaxone and albumin. He underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated in the morning once the effects of diazepam wore off. The patient has a Foley catheter in place for urinary output monitoring. A social work consult was requested, and the sister is reluctant to pursue a hospice consult. The patient has allergies to gluten and celiac sprue.

24-hour events include a stool culture and invasive ventilation. The patient received antibiotics and various medications, including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.

Flow sheet data indicates the patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/60 mmHg to 92/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set pressure of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and PIP of 10 cmH2O. The patient has been receiving fluids and has had a positive fluid balance.

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with metastatic treatment-refractory hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who presented with altered mental status and concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was intubated for airway protection and found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has a history of cirrhosis with limited evaluation for focal lesions, moderate ascites, and nonocclusive thrombus in the main portal vein with slow flow.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 99/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and temperature of 36.1 C. The patient's physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with ascites, warm skin, and normal heart sounds. Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 6.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 128 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, and hypoalbuminemia.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his ABG shows a pH of 7.18. The patient's medical history includes gluten allergy, celiac sprue, and ongoing treatment for metastatic HCC with recent chemotherapy. The patient has been off sorafenib for the past month.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of metastatic treatment-refractory hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He presented with altered mental status and concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), intubated for airway protection, and found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's respiratory failure was not due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also had hypotension, which was not due to shock, and chronic anemia. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, exacerbated by SBP and his immunocompromised state from cancer and chemotherapy. The patient's portal vein thrombosis with poor clearance of toxins also contributed to the altered mental status. The patient's liver function has deteriorated, leading to the diagnosis of SBP as a precipitating event. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which was negative for bleeding. He received treatment for SBP and aggressive lactulose therapy to manage hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's blood culture was negative for any infection. The patient's condition improved with SBP treatment and aggressive lactulose therapy. The patient's respiratory failure necessitated intubation in the emergency department for airway protection and he arrived in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) on pressure support. After an EGD and sedation, the patient was successfully extubated"
