","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia and chronic abdominal pain. She presented with severe post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis. The patient's current assessment includes severe pancreatitis, possibly necrotizing based on CT scan findings. She is hemodynamically stable but persistently tachycardic.

The plan of care includes the following:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient is advised to be kept nil per os (NPO), receive aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's (LR) to achieve a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10-12, maintain urine output greater than 30 cc/hr, administer broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and meropenem, obtain blood cultures, trend blood pH with arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, manage pain with intravenous hydromorphone (Dilaudid) on an as-needed basis while closely monitoring respiratory status, consider low threshold for intubation, provide aggressive electrolyte repletion including calcium, and trend amylase and lipase levels.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to pain and intravascular depletion. The plan is to aggressively provide intravenous fluids and pain control as mentioned above.

3. Anemia: The patient may have developed anemia due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia and chronic abdominal pain who presents with severe post-ERCP pancreatitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe and possibly necrotizing pancreatitis based on the CT scan findings. The patient's heart rate is persistently elevated, and there is a potential for dramatic worsening.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to a combination of pain and intravascular depletion. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and pain management should be continued.

3. Anemia: The patient may have developed anemia as a result of aggressive fluid resuscitation and hemodilution. Close monitoring of the patient's blood count and consideration for transfusion to achieve a goal of 30 should be done.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and it is important to continue treatment with Levoxyl.

5. Other issues: The patient requires prophylactic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pain management with IV dilaudid, and monitoring of arterial and venous lines. The patient's code status is confirmed as full code, and the disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pancreatitis, development of infections,"

The patient is experiencing moderate respiratory distress using accessory muscles and is writhing with pain.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (20.0 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin (9.3 g/dL), elevated blood glucose (not specified), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (575 IU/L), and low calcium level (6.7 mg/dL).

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia and chronic abdominal pain, presenting with severe post-ERCP pancreatitis and borderline shock physiology. The patient has been receiving aggressive fluid support to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) at 12. Antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) have been initiated. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth), and elective intubation is being considered due to respiratory distress, likely caused by fluid overload. Hypernatremia and hyperchloremia have been noted, and D5W intake has been increased to improve free water intake. The patient's anemia is stable, and monitoring of hematocrit (Hct) levels is ongoing. Hypothyroidism is also present, and levothyroxine has been switched to intravenous administration since the patient is NPO. Pain management is being provided with IV dilaudid. The patient is currently in the ICU and will remain there for now."

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, evolving pleural
   effusions, and possible evolving ARDS.  Monitor respiratory status (RR,
   SaO2, ABG), plan for elective intubation.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- good resussitation overnight, with improved CVP and urine
   output.  Now CVP= [**2-11**] suggestive of hypovolemic due to ongoing
   intraabdominal inflammation (3rd spacing in context of acute
   pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Plan continue to fluid bolus to CVP>12 cm
   H2O.  Need to avoid hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.  Need to
   change central line
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical presentation, blood work and ABD CT
   findings consistent with acute necrotizing pancreatits, severe.  Likely
   related to ERCP, perhaps on background of chronic pancreatits (?related
   to hyperlipidemia).  Guarded condition, at risk for clinical decline.
   Will require vigorous volume resussitation (extensive 3rd spacing due
   to intraabdominal inflammation), vigorous electrolyte repletion (esp K,
   Ca) --> may require Ca drip.  Empirical antimicrobials (elevated WBC
   and significant bandemia), including meropenem.  General Surgery
   consultation to follow.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- declining urine output likely reflects intravascular
   depletion (SG= 1.030) on background of mild renal insufficiency.
   Continue iv fluids, monitor BUN creat, uo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- likely due to resussitation fliuds.  Plan provide free
   H2O.
   ACIDOSIS -- Declining HCO3, likley reflect pancreatitis, renal
   insufficincy.  Follow ABG.  Consider HCO3 infusion.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Would start TPN if remains NPO.  Consider
   trophic tube feedings (10 cc/hr).
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- check ionoized calcium; replete, may need iv infusion
   ANEMIA -- decline in Hct may in part reflect iv fliuds, but at risk for
   bleeding.  Would re-image abdomen to r/o hemorrhage into pancreatic
   bed.
   WBC/bandemia -- resolving.  Concern for infectious complication of
   pancreatitis.  Obtain cultures and start continue empirical
   antimicrobials.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- optimize pain mangement.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with acute pancreatitis, respiratory distress, and necrotizing pancreatitis. They have a history of hyperlipidemia and recent ERCP procedure. The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, likely due to intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resuscitation, evolving pleural effusions, and possible evolving ARDS. The plan is to monitor respiratory status and consider elective intubation.

The patient also has tachycardia, which is multifactorial and includes acute pancreatitis, pain, intravascular depletion, and possible blood loss. The CVP is low, indicating hypovolemia due to ongoing intraabdominal inflammation. Fluid bolus will be continued to maintain CVP above 12 cm H2O.

The patient has acute necrotizing pancreatitis, severe, with clinical presentation, blood work, and ABD CT findings consistent with this diagnosis. The condition is guarded and at risk for clinical decline. Vigorous volume resuscitation and electrolyte repletion will be required. Empirical antimicrobials have been started due to elevated WBC and significant bandemia.

Renal function is declining, with declining urine output likely reflecting intravascular depletion on background of mild renal insufficiency. Continue iv fluids and monitor BUN creat, uo.

Hypernatremia is likely due to resuscitation fluids. Plan to provide free water. Acidosis is declining HCO3, likely reflecting pancreatitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, evolving pleural
   effusions, and possible evolving ARDS.  Monitor respiratory status (RR,
   SaO2, ABG), plan for elective intubation.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- good resussitation overnight, with improved CVP and urine
   output.  Now CVP= [**2-11**] suggestive of hypovolemic due to ongoing
   intraabdominal inflammation (3rd spacing in context of acute
   pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Plan continue to fluid bolus to CVP>12 cm
   H2O.  Need to avoid hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.  Need to
   change central line
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical presentation, blood work and ABD CT
   findings consistent with acute necrotizing pancreatits, severe.  Likely
   related to ERCP, perhaps on background of chronic pancreatits (?related
   to hyperlipidemia).  Guarded condition, at risk for clinical decline.
   Will require vigorous volume resussitation (extensive 3rd spacing due
   to intraabdominal inflammation), vigorous electrolyte repletion (esp K,
   Ca) --> may require Ca drip.  Empirical antimicrobials (elevated WBC
   and significant bandemia), including meropenem.  General Surgery
   consultation to follow.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- declining urine output likely reflects intravascular
   depletion (SG= 1.030) on background of mild renal insufficiency.
   Continue iv fluids, monitor BUN creat, uo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- likely due to resussitation fliuds.  Plan provide free
   H2O.
   ACIDOSIS -- Declining HCO3, likley reflect pancreatitis, renal
   insufficincy.  Follow ABG.  Consider HCO3 infusion.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Would start TPN if remains NPO.  Consider
   trophic tube feedings (10 cc/hr).
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- check ionoized calcium; replete, may need iv infusion
   ANEMIA -- decline in Hct may in part reflect iv fliuds, but at risk for
   bleeding.  Would re-image abdomen to r/o hemorrhage into pancreatic
   bed.
   WBC/bandemia -- resolving.  Concern for infectious complication of
   pancreatitis.  Obtain cultures and start continue empirical
   antimicrobials.
   PAIN MANAGEMENT -- optimize pain mangement.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with acute pancreatitis, respiratory distress, and other medical complications. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 122 beats per minute, blood pressure of 171/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, statins, and Naproxen. They are currently receiving various medications and fluids through IV infusions.

The patient's review of systems indicates significant abdominal pain and dyspnea. They have a history of being NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving tube feeds or parenteral nutrition. There are no signs of cough, wheezing, or chest pain. The patient also has no history of joint pain, myalgias, numbness/tingling, or seizures.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Their eyes are PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), and they do not have conjunctival pallor or scleral edema. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI), regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. The respiratory examination reveals crackles on auscultation, and the abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness. The extremities are warm and well-perfused, but there is no cyanosis or clubbing.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 yo F with  post ERCP necrotic pancreatitis electively
   intubated to allow fluid resuscitation.
   .
   #. Pancreatitis: No longer requiring fluid to maintain CVP and UOP.
   Abd tense, will watch bladder pressures closely.
   - Consider repeat imaging of pancreas to look for phlegmon/indications
   for surgery
   - IVF boluses for UOP<50
   -Appreciate Surgery recs
   -NPO
   -ABX with vanc/meropenem
   -Blood cx
   -Trend blood pH with ABGs
   -Aggressive electrolyte repletion, including calcium with Q6 calcium
   checks
   -Trend [**Doctor First Name 92**]/lipase
   #Respiratory distress: Likely becoming fluid overloaded w/ aggressive
   diuresis, CXR more opaque
   -          Continue intubated for now as HD stability is tenuous
   #Sedation: Pt. in extreme pain when awake, will likely need to continue
   deep sedation for now given level of pain, but would continue daily
   wake ups
   - fentanyl midazolam
   - daily wake ups
   # Hypernatremia/Hyperchloremia: Improved.
   .
   #. Anemia: Stable, Hct not trending up or down very quickly

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with post-ERCP necrotic pancreatitis, who was electively intubated to allow for fluid resuscitation. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 118 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 129/56 to 176/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. 

The patient's urine output has decreased to below 50cc/hour, and abdominal tension has increased. The central venous pressure (CVP) has dropped to 8 and then increased to 15. Telemetry shows bursts of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). 

The patient has multiple allergies to sulfa, statins, and naproxen. She received antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) at different times. The patient is currently on midazolam (versed) and fentanyl infusions, as well as other ICU medications. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 8,091 mL and output of 2,285 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,806 mL. The patient is receiving fluids through intravenous lines, and blood products have been given as well. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia and chronic abdominal pain, who presents with severe post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis and borderline shock physiology. The patient's urine output has decreased to below 50cc/hour, and abdominal tension is present. The central venous pressure (CVP) has dropped to 8. The patient received a total of 2 liters of lactated Ringer's solution with 1 liter of dextrose 5% added.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury: The significant decrease in urine output suggests a potential risk of acute kidney injury due to decreased renal perfusion.
2. Hypotension: The low CVP and borderline shock physiology indicate the possibility of hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to further complications.
3. Pancreatitis: Severe pancreatitis may progress to necrotizing pancreatitis or infected pancreatic necrosis, increasing the risk of systemic infection and sepsis.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory distress, which could necessitate intubation to ensure adequate oxygenation.
5. Fluid Overload: Aggressive fluid resuscitation may lead to fluid overload, especially in the context of respiratory distress. Monitoring fluid balance is crucial to prevent complications associated with fluid overload.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, evolving pleural
   effusions, and possible evolving ARDS.  Monitor respiratory status (RR,
   SaO2, ABG), continue mechanical ventilation, change to AC mode, monitor
   ABG.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- excellent resussitation, with improved CVP and urine output.
   (3rd spacing in context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Plan
   continue to fluid bolus to CVP>12 cm H2O.  Need to change central line.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- Responding to current support.  Guarded
   condition.  Continue current levle of care.  MOnitor bladder
   pressures.  General Surgery consultation to follow.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- likely due to resussitation fliuds.  Plan provide free
   H2O.
   ACIDOSIS -- Follow bicarb, ABG.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Would start TPN if remains NPO.  Consider
   trophic tube feedings (10 cc/hr).
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- check ionoized calcium; replete, may need iv infusion
   ANEMIA -- decline in Hct may in part reflect iv fliuds, but at risk for
   bleeding.  Would re-image abdomen to r/o hemorrhage into pancreatic
   bed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, likely attributed to intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resuscitation, evolving pleural effusions, and possible evolving ARDS. The patient also has tachycardia, which is multifactorial and being monitored. Fluid resuscitation has been effective, with improved CVP and urine output. The patient is responding to current support for acute pancreatitis, although the condition is guarded. Renal function is preserved, but there is hypernatremia likely due to resuscitation fluids. Acidosis is being monitored, and nutritional support is planned. The patient has hypoocalcemia and is at risk for bleeding, with a declining Hct. Anemia may be related to IV fluids, but further imaging is needed to rule out hemorrhage into the pancreatic bed. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial. It may be attributed to intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resuscitation, evolving pleural effusions, and possible evolving ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Monitoring respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG), continuing mechanical ventilation, and changing to AC mode are recommended.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has tachycardia, which could be due to acute pancreatitis, pain, intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss, or other factors. Primary cardiac events should be ruled out. Monitoring and treating the underlying process are advised.

3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has an excellent resuscitation with improved CVP (central venous pressure) and urine output. However, third spacing in the context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing, and fluid bolus to CVP>12 cm H2O are planned. Changing the central line is also necessary.

4. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient is responding to current support, but the condition is guarded. Monitoring bladder pressures and continuing the current level of care are recommended. A general surgery consultation is needed to follow.

5. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is preserved, and it should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall stable, perhaps
   early signs of resolution.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG), continue
   mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Stable. Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- excellent resussitation, with improved CVP and urine output.
   (3rd spacing in context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Monitor.
   Allow net diuresis (spontaneou).  Fluid bolus if hypotension.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- Responding to current support.  Guarded
   condition.  Continue current levle of care.  MOnitor bladder
   pressures.  General Surgery consultation to follow.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.  Consider
   diuretics.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.
   ACIDOSIS -- Improved.  Follow bicarb, ABG.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains NPO.  Start TPN.  Consider trophic tube
   feedings (10 cc/hr).
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- check ionoized calcium; replete, may need iv infusion
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  If further decline, would re-image abdomen to r/o
   hemorrhage into pancreatic bed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing, and respiratory failure. There are signs of early resolution in the pancreatitis. The respiratory failure is multifactorial and attributed to intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resuscitation, and pleural effusions. The patient also has tachycardia, which is likely due to acute pancreatitis, pain, intravascular depletion, and possible blood loss. Fluid resuscitation has been excellent with improved central venous pressure (CVP) and urine output. The patient's renal function is preserved, but there is a concern for hypernatremia, acidosis, and nutritional support. The patient's condition remains stable, and further care will be provided in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of pancreatitis, development of renal dysfunction, and potential infections due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation."

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall stable, perhaps
   early signs of resolution.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG), continue
   mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Stable. Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- excellent resussitation, with improved CVP and urine output.
   (3rd spacing in context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Monitor.
   Allow net diuresis (spontaneou).  Fluid bolus if hypotension.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- Responding to current support.  Guarded
   condition.  Continue current levle of care.  MOnitor bladder
   pressures.  General Surgery consultation to follow.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.  Consider
   diuretics.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.
   ACIDOSIS -- Improved.  Follow bicarb, ABG.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Would start TPN if remains NPO.  Consider
   trophic tube feedings (10 cc/hr).
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- check ionoized calcium; replete, may need iv infusion
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  If further decline, would re-image abdomen to r/o
   hemorrhage into pancreatic bed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with post-ERCP necrotic pancreatitis. She was electively intubated to allow for fluid resuscitation. The patient's pancreatitis is improving, as indicated by decreasing amylase/lipase levels, less tense abdomen, and negative fluid balance. However, there are concerns about the development of an abscess or phlegmon. The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, with fluid overload and heavy sedation contributing to the issue. She failed pressure support last night and continues on assist-control ventilation. The patient's sedation levels are hypertensive after manipulation of the abdomen and she responds well to fentanyl. Deep sedation will likely be continued due to the extreme pain, but daily wake-ups will be maintained.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abscess formation: There is a concern for the development of an abscess due to necrotic pancreatitis. Repeat imaging of the pancreas may be necessary to look for indications for surgery.
2. Phlegmon: The patient may also develop a phlegmon, which is a localized infection and inflammation in the pancreas area. This could lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypotension and hypoperfusion: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating a potential risk for hypotension and subsequent hypoperfusion, especially considering the presence of necrotic pancreatitis.
4. Respiratory distress: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall continues gradual
   clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  CXR improving.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG),
   continue mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Stable. Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- excellent resussitation, with improved CVP and urine output.
   (3rd spacing in context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Monitor.
   Allow net diuresis (spontaneous).  Fluid bolus if hypotension, but
   desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- Responding to current support, with good
   progress.  Guarded condition.  Continue current levle of care.  Monitor
   bladder pressures.  General Surgery consultation to follow.
   WBC/bandemia
 may be intraabdominal inflammation but concern for
   complication of necrotising pancreatitis.

   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.  Consider
   diuretics to facilitate net diuresis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Improved.  Monitor Na+.  [**Month (only) 11**] need to resume free H2O.
   ACIDOSIS -- Improved.  Follow bicarb, ABG.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with post ERCP necrotizing pancreatitis who is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications:

1. Moderate layering nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusions with underlying atelectasis, new in comparison to [**2179-3-9**]. This indicates fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can impair gas exchange and lead to respiratory distress.

2. Necrotizing pancreatitis involving greater than 50% of the pancreas. Only the pancreatic head and a small amount of the pancreatic tail enhance normally. This suggests extensive damage to the pancreas, which can result in systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

3. Extensive peripancreatic fluid, without defined collection or gas. Ascites in the abdomen and pelvis. The presence of ascites indicates fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity, which may be due to the inflammatory response and decreased blood flow to the abdomen.

4. Patent, but attenuated splenic vein. Increased size of collateral vessels indicates compromised splenic vein flow. This suggests impaired blood flow through the splenic vein, potentially leading to complications such as varices or gastrointestinal bleeding.

5. Bowel wall thickening of the sigmoid colon, which may be related to ascites, although colitis cannot be excluded. Thickening of the bowel wall can be indicative of inflammation or infection, and in this case, it may be related to the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall continues gradual
   clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  CXR improving.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG),
   continue mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Stable. Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- excellent resussitation, with improved CVP and urine output.
   (3rd spacing in context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Monitor.
   Allow net diuresis (spontaneous).  Fluid bolus if hypotension, but
   desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- Responding to current support, with good
   progress.  Guarded condition.  Continue current levle of care.  Monitor
   bladder pressures.  General Surgery consultation to follow.
   FEVER -- recurrent, possible intra-abdminal inflammation.  However,
   WBC/bandemia may reflect intra-abdominal inflammation or  concern for
   complication of necrotising pancreatitis but no evidence by CT scan.
   Also need to monitor for new infection, such as VAP, C. Diff,
   Line-related, bladder catheter-related  (evaluation in progress)
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- need to add insulin to TPN.   Maintain glucose <150.
   ABD Pain
 strictures noted on ERCP.  Needs follow-up
   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.  Consider
   diuretics to facilitate net diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains NPO.  TPN started.  Consider trophic tube
   feedings (10 cc/hr).
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  If further decline, would re-image abdomen to r/o
   hemorrhage into pancreatic bed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute pancreatitis, necrotizing, and respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments to manage their condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being monitored, and they continue to require mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for pleural effusions, which can worsen respiratory function. Monitoring of RR, SaO2, and ABG is ongoing.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, possibly due to acute pancreatitis, pain, intravascular depletion, and potential blood loss. It is being monitored, and any underlying processes are being treated.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has received excellent resuscitation with improved CVP and urine output. However, there is concern for third spacing in the context of necrotizing pancreatitis. Net diuresis is encouraged while closely monitoring fluid balance.
4. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is responding to current support, but the condition remains guarded. Bladder pressures are being monitored, and a general surgery consultation will follow.
5. Fever: Recurrent fever may indicate intra-abdominal inflammation or a complication of necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitoring for new infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile, line-related, and bladder"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall continues gradual
   clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  CXR improving.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG),
   continue mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Stable. Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- excellent resussitation, with improved CVP and urine output.
   (3rd spacing in context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Monitor.
   Allow net diuresis (spontaneous).  Fluid bolus if hypotension, but
   desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- Responding to current support, with good
   progress.  Guarded condition.  Continue current levle of care.  Monitor
   bladder pressures.  General Surgery consultation to follow.
   FEVER -- recurrent, possible intra-abdminal inflammation.  However,
   WBC/bandemia may reflect intra-abdominal inflammation or  concern for
   complication of necrotising pancreatitis but no evidence by CT scan.
   Also need to monitor for new infection, such as VAP, C. Diff,
   Line-related, bladder catheter-related  (evaluation in progress)
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- need to add insulin to TPN.   Maintain glucose <150.
   ABD Pain
 strictures noted on ERCP.  Needs follow-up
   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.  Consider
   diuretics to facilitate net diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains NPO.  TPN started.  Consider trophic tube
   feedings (10 cc/hr).
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  If further decline, would re-image abdomen to r/o
   hemorrhage into pancreatic bed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, respiratory failure, tachycardia, and hyperglycemia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. There are strictures noted on ERCP. The patient's renal function is preserved. They are currently receiving TPN and have strict fluid management due to third spacing in the context of acute pancreatitis. Fever is recurrent, possibly due to intra-abdominal inflammation or concern for complications of necrotizing pancreatitis. Anemia is stable, and the patient's pain management plan includes opioids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status, including RR, SaO2, and ABG, will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the ventilation support.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be attributed to acute pancreatitis, pain, intravascular depletion, or possible blood loss. It is important to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and treat any underlying processes contributing to the tachycardia.

3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has received excellent resuscitation, but there is concern for third spacing in the context of acute pancreatitis. Fluid management should continue to be closely monitored to avoid fluid overload or under-resuscitation.

4. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient is showing gradual clinical improvement"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female who underwent an elective intubation to allow for fluid resuscitation due to necrotic pancreatitis. The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, which the surgical team believes to be due to necrotizing pancreatitis. Antibiotics were discontinued per surgery recommendations.

The patient's vital signs indicate hypertension, possibly in response to pain or manipulation. Sedation has been weaned, and there have been efforts to trial pressure support and diuresis. The patient's mental status is limiting factors in moving towards extubation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), increasing trends, and leukocytosis. Blood glucose levels are high, and there is evidence of fluid overload with negative fluid balance. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include stable pancreatitis without current indication for immediate surgery. The patient has been experiencing fevers, and while the source is not clear, it could be related to resorption of necrotic pancreas or an infectious cause. Antibiotics were stopped per surgery recommendations, and blood cultures are being followed.

There are concerns about possible Clostridium difficile colitis, and the fever/elevated WBC may be related to necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including fluid overload and heavy sedation for extreme pain. The patient is currently intubated but improving with diuresis.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo F with  post ERCP necrotic pancreatitis electively intubated to
   allow fluid resuscitation.
   .
   #. Pancreatitis:  Stable.  Abdominal exam is improving, there is no
   guarding, abdomen is soft.  Has improved since patient has been
   diuresing.  CT abdomen shows no evidence of pseudocyst or hemorrhage.
   Patient has WBC increasing and increasingly febrile, but this could be
   [**1-11**] resorption of necrotic pancreas versus an undefined infectious
   cause.
   - Continue vanc/meropenem and flagyl as below
   - Blood cx
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion
   - Trend [**Doctor First Name 92**]/lipase
   # Fevers:  Tmax 101.8.  Patient with leukocytosis to 31.  No clear
   infectious source.  Cx from A-line, Subclavian, peripheral sent.
   Patient has not stooled to check C Diff.  CT does show sigmoid bowel
   wall thickening, that could be suggestive of a colitis.
   Fever/elevated WBC count could also be related to necrotizing
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not exhibit septic physiology.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Meropenem
   - Start IV Flagyl for empiric C Diff coverage.
   - If patient clinically worsens, consider PO/PR Vancomycin
   - f/u Cxs
   #Respiratory distress: Multifactorial, fluid overload + heavy sedation
   for extreme pain.   Patient currently intubated, improving with
   diuresis.
   - Continue on AC for now
   - Goal 2L negative today
   #Sedation: Hypertense after manipulation of abdomen and responds to
   fentanyl, will likely need to continue deep sedation for now given
   level of pain, but would continue daily wake ups
   - Wean Fentanyl as tolerated
   - daily wake ups
   # FEN:  Patient
s Na was 142, stable.  Patient on TPN for nutrition.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with post-ERCP necrotic pancreatitis who was electively intubated to allow for fluid resuscitation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 107 bpm and elevated blood pressure of 169/64 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 273.

The patient's laboratory values reveal leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 20.9 to 35.9 K/uL. Other notable lab results include a Hct level ranging from 22.9 to 28.0, platelet count of 15,000/mm3, serum creatinine level ranging from 1.1 to 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 113 and 246 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.0 mmol/L.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of pancreatitis, fevers, respiratory distress, sedation, anemia, hypothyroidism, and DVT prophylaxis. The patient is expected to continue on"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall continues gradual
   clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  CXR stable.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG),
   continue mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Stable. Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- excellent resussitation, with improved CVP and urine output.
   (3rd spacing in context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Monitor.
   Allow net diuresis (spontaneous).  Fluid bolus if hypotension, but
   desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- Responding to current support, with good
   progress.  Continue current levle of care.  Monitor bladder pressures.
   General Surgery consultation to follow.
   ELEVATED WBC -- attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Monitor.
   FEVER -- recurrent, possible intra-abdminal inflammation.  However,
   WBC/bandemia may reflect intra-abdominal inflammation or  concern for
   complication of necrotising pancreatitis but no evidence by CT scan.
   Also need to monitor for new infection, such as VAP, C. Diff,
   Line-related, bladder catheter-related  (evaluation in progress).
   Monitor off antimicrobials.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- need to add insulin to TPN.   Insulin drip.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   ABD Pain
 strictures noted on ERCP.  Needs follow-up.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.  Consider

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They have been intubated and are receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, and strictures noted on ERCP. Other significant findings include fever, hyperglycemia, elevated white blood cell count, tachycardia, preserved renal function, anemia, and nutritional support through TPN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and mechanical ventilation should be continued. ABG analysis and oxygen saturation levels should be regularly assessed.
2. Tachycardia: The underlying causes of tachycardia, such as acute pancreatitis, pain, intravascular depletion, and possible blood loss, need to be treated. The patient's heart rhythm should be continuously monitored.
3. Fluid balance: Fluid resuscitation has been provided, and the patient's CVP and urine output have improved. Monitoring the patient's fluid status is crucial to prevent fluid overload or hypotension.
4. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's condition should be closely monitored for any worsening of symptoms or complications related to necrotizing pancreatitis. Surgical consultation may be required.
5. Elevated WBC count: The elevated white blood cell count is attributed to acute pancreatitis. Monitoring the patient's WBC levels is necessary to assess the progression of the condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall continues gradual
   clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  CXR stable.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG),
   continue mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Stable. Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- excellent resussitation, with improved CVP and urine output.
   (3rd spacing in context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Monitor.
   Allow net diuresis (spontaneous).  Fluid bolus if hypotension, but
   desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- Responding to current support, with good
   progress.  Continue current levle of care.  Monitor bladder pressures.
   General Surgery consultation to follow.
   ELEVATED WBC -- attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Monitor.
   FEVER -- recurrent, possible intra-abdminal inflammation.  However,
   WBC/bandemia may reflect intra-abdominal inflammation or  concern for
   complication of necrotising pancreatitis but no evidence by CT scan.
   Also need to monitor for new infection, such as VAP, C. Diff,
   Line-related, bladder catheter-related  (evaluation in progress).
   Monitor off antimicrobials.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- need to add insulin to TPN.   Insulin drip.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   ABD Pain
 strictures noted on ERCP.  Needs follow-up.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.  Consider
   diuretics to facilitate net diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with acute pancreatitis, necrotizing, and respiratory failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can be prevented by maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing daily oral care, and monitoring respiratory system compliance and resistance.

2. Infection: The patient has recurrent fever, and there is a concern for intra-abdominal inflammation or complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitoring for new infections like VAP, Clostridium difficile, line-related infections, and bladder catheter-related infections is essential.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, and insulin needs to be added to total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Insulin drip should be maintained to keep glucose levels below 150 mg/dL.

4. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is preserved, but it should be closely monitored with regular assessments of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Diuretics may be considered to facilitate net diuresis.

5. Nutritional Support: The patient is currently NPO, and TPN has been started. Considering the patient's condition, post-pyloric feeding tube placement may be planned for trophic tube feedings.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall continues gradual
   clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  CXR stable.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG),
   continue mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Stable. Monitor, treat underlying process.
   FLUIDS -- excellent resussitation, with improved CVP and urine output.
   (3rd spacing in context of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing).  Monitor.
   Allow net diuresis (spontaneous).  Fluid bolus if hypotension, but
   desire net negative fluid balance.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- ERCP-related.  Responding to current support,
   with good progress.  Mild increase in amylase/lipase --> need to
   monitor.  General Surgery consultation to follow.
   ELEVATED WBC -- attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Now with mounting
   bandemia.  Concern for evolving new infection or infectious
   complication of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Monitor.
   FEVER -- recurrent, possible intra-abdminal inflammation.  However,
   WBC/bandemia may reflect intra-abdominal inflammation or  concern for
   complication of necrotising pancreatitis but no evidence by CT scan.
   Also need to monitor for new infection, such as VAP, C. Diff,
   Line-related, bladder catheter-related  (evaluation in progress).
   Monitor off antimicrobials.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- need to add insulin to TPN.   Insulin drip.  Maintain
   glucose <150.
   ABD Pain
 strictures noted on ERCP.  Needs follow-up.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.  Consider
   diuretics to facilitate net diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains NPO.  TPN started.  Consider trophic tube
   feedings (10 cc/hr) --> plan for post-pyloric feeding tube placement
   per IR.
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  If further decline, would re-image abdomen to r/o
   hemorrhage into pancreatic bed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient is somewhat more responsive neurologically and is being weaned from sedation. The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis after ERCP, and is showing gradual clinical improvement. They have elevated white blood cell count and bandemia, which may indicate an evolving new infection or infectious complication of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient also has fever, hyperglycemia, and anemia. They have strictures noted on ERCP, preserved renal function, and remain NPO with TPN started. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, including respiratory status, fluid balance, and nutritional support. Potential medical complications include respiratory failure, tachycardia, fluids management, acute pancreatitis, elevated WBC, fever, hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, renal function, and nutritional support."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure. Multifactorial causes such as intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resuscitation, and pleural effusions are contributing to this condition. Monitoring respiratory status, continuing mechanical ventilation, and maintaining airway control are essential.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be due to acute pancreatitis, pain, intravascular depletion (third spacing), or possible blood loss. Although primary cardiac events are unlikely, monitoring and treating the underlying process are necessary.

3. Fluids: The patient has received excellent resuscitation with improved central venous pressure (CVP) and urine output. However, fluid bolus administration should be done cautiously to prevent net negative fluid balance.

4. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has necrotizing pancreatitis related to ERCP. There is a mild increase in amylase/lipase levels, so monitoring is required. General Surgery consultation will follow for further management.

5. Elevated White Blood Cell Count (WBC): The high WBC count may be attributed to acute pancreatitis. However, the presence of bandemia raises concerns about evolving new infections or infectious complications of necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitoring for these possibilities"

   #. Pancreatitis:  Stable.  Abdominal exam stable, there is no guarding,
   abdomen is softening.  Continues to mobilize fluid on her own.  CT
   abdomen from Sunday showed no current indication for immediate
   surgery.  Patient has WBC increasing and increasingly febrile, but this
   likely secondary to resorption of necrotic pancreas.  Amylase and
   lipase are increasing, unclear etiology.  Patient clinically
   improving.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with post ERCP necrotic pancreatitis who was electively intubated to allow for fluid resuscitation. The patient has been experiencing fever and an increasing white blood cell count, which is likely secondary to the resorption of necrotic pancreas. The amylase and lipase levels are also increasing, although the exact etiology is unclear. The patient's condition is improving clinically.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis indicate an ongoing infection. Possible c.diff colitis should be considered, and if the patient's condition worsens, broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient initially experienced respiratory distress due to fluid overload and heavy sedation for extreme pain. She is currently intubated but improving with diuresis. Mental status appears to be limiting her progress toward extubation. Weaning sedation and continuing diuresis will be important in managing this complication.

3. Hypertension: The patient developed hypertension after manipulation of the abdomen and responds to fentanyl, suggesting that pain may be contributing to the high blood pressure. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure, potentially weaning fentanyl as tolerated.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is decreasing, indicating anemia. It is necessary to monitor and potentially transfuse packed"

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall continues gradual
   clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  CXR stable.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG),
   continue mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   NEUROGICAL STATUS -- Non-focal exam, may reflect sedation/analgesia.
   Poor ability to attend.  Concern for possible intracranial process -->
   consider head CT to assess interhemispheric bleed, bilateral CVA or
   posterior CVA.  Consider Flumazenil trial to exclude slow clearance of
   benzodiazepine as etiology for altered MS.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Doubt
   primary cardiac event.  Stable. Monitor, treat underlying process.
   HTN -- Variable periods of HTN alternating with normotension or
   relative [**Name (NI) 5305**].  [**Name2 (NI) 11**] be related to level of alertness,
   aggitation/anxiety, or concern for pain.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- s/p resussitation, now tolerating net diuresis.  Desire net
   negative fluid balance to baseline weight.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- ERCP-related.  Responding to current support,
   with good progress.  Mild increase in amylase/lipase --> need to
   monitor.  General Surgery consultation to follow.
   ELEVATED WBC -- attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Now with mounting
   bandemia.  Concern for evolving new infection or infectious
   complication of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Monitor.
   FEVER -- recurrent, possible intra-abdminal inflammation.  However,
   WBC/bandemia may reflect intra-abdominal inflammation or  concern for
   complication of necrotising pancreatitis but no evidence by CT scan.
   Also need to monitor for new infection, such as VAP, C. Diff,
   Line-related, bladder catheter-related  (evaluation in progress).
   Monitor off antimicrobials.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- improved control with insulin in TPN.   Insulin drip.
   Maintain glucose <150.  Monitor for hypoglycemia.
   ABD PAIN
 strictures noted on ERCP.  Needs follow-up.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- Preserved.  Monitor BUN creat, uo.  Consider
   diuretics to facilitate net diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains NPO.  TPN started.  Plan post-pyloric
   feeding tube placement to begin trophic tube feedings (10 cc/hr).
   ANEMIA -- Stable.  If further decline, would re-image abdomen to r/o

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. 

The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, which appears to be necrotizing and associated with strictures noted on ERCP. They also have an elevated white blood cell count with bandemia, indicating a possible evolving new infection or infectious complication of necrotizing pancreatitis. 

The patient is experiencing tachycardia, which may be due to acute pancreatitis, pain, intravascular depletion (third spacing), or possible blood loss. Hypertension is also present, with variable periods of high blood pressure alternating with normotension or relative hypotension. 

The patient has hyperglycemia, which has improved with insulin in total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Insulin therapy is being maintained to keep glucose levels below 150 mg/dL and monitor for hypoglycemia. 

Additionally, the patient has anemia that is stable at present, but further decline may necessitate re-imaging the abdomen to rule out hemorrhage into the pancreatic bed. Renal function is preserved, and consideration is being given to diuretics to facilitate net diuresis. 

Nutritional support is ongoing, with the patient remaining NPO and receiving TPN. A plan has been made to place a post-pyloric feeding tube for trophic tube feedings"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with acute pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. They are currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's mental status is abnormal, with eyes open but not attending. Flumazenil trial showed minimal change in alertness. The patient has a history of encephalopathy and endotracheal tube placement. There are concerns for possible intracranial processes, such as interhemispheric bleed, bilateral CVA, or posterior CVA, so a head CT is being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and mechanical ventilation should be continued. Pleural effusions may contribute to respiratory failure, so ongoing monitoring and treatment are necessary.
2. Neurological Status: The patient's neurological status is non-focal and may reflect sedation/analgesia. Poor ability to attend is concerning, and further evaluation for possible intracranial processes is needed.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has multifactorial tachycardia, possibly due to acute pancreatitis, pain, intravascular depletion, and possible blood loss. Close monitoring and treatment of underlying processes are required.
4. Hypertension: Variable periods of hypertension alternating with normotension or relative hypotension have been observed. Monitoring and addressing the underlying cause are essential.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with post-ERCP necrotic pancreatitis who was electively intubated to allow for fluid resuscitation. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is stable, with no guarding and a softening abdomen. Fluid mobilization is ongoing, and the CT abdomen shows no current indication for immediate surgery. The patient's WBC count is increasing, but this may be secondary to resorption of necrotic pancreas. Amylase and lipase levels are increasing but now starting to trend down. Further follow-up with blood cultures, electrolyte repletion, and surgical recommendations are needed.

2. Fevers: The patient has a fever with a maximum temperature of 102°F. Leukocytosis is present with a WBC count of 39.4. There is no clear infectious source, and the patient does not appear septic. All lines have been cultured, and possible C. difficile colitis should be considered. If the patient clinically worsens, broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered. C. difficile should be checked twice, and blood glucan and galactomannan tests should be done.

3. Neurological status: The patient is not withdrawing to pain, is flaccid in both upper and lower extremities, and has a non-focal neurologic examination. Her open eyes and"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with necrotic pancreatitis and was electively intubated for fluid resuscitation. The patient's condition has shown improvement, with declining fevers and WBC count, suggesting a decreasing infection burden. However, the patient still exhibits difficulty moving her arms, which could be attributed to ICU myopathy or residual benzodiazepine effect.

The patient's respiratory distress has improved, as she was successfully extubated and is maintaining oxygen saturation on a shovel mask. The hypertension has also improved, and diuresis is being continued.

The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutrition and will continue to do so per surgery recommendations. Anemia is being managed with phlebotomy and PRBC transfusion as needed. Hypothyroidism is being treated with levothyroxine IV, and TSH levels are within normal range.

The patient has a history of unknown allergies to sulfa, statins, and naproxen. She is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium for DVT prevention and pain management with fentanyl boluses.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted with necrotic pancreatitis and required intubation for fluid resuscitation. She has undergone several interventions, including the placement of an IR (likely inferior vena cava) filter, which unfortunately clogged and could not be unclogged by surgery. The patient also received diuretics, resulting in hypotension and the administration of a fluid bolus. Her urine remained positive for benzos (benzodiazepines), and a trial of flumazenil failed to improve her mental status. The patient's mental status improved after withdrawing midazolam and was subsequently extubated, able to talk.

Telemetry revealed short runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient has allergies to sulfa, statins, and naproxen. Her last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2179-3-18**] at 08:18 AM. She received infusions of fentanyl and heparin sodium.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 102 bpm (with a range of 99-119 bpm), blood pressure of 96/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (with a range of 19-37 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her weight is 71.9 kg, and her height is 64 inches. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg (with a range of 4-9 mmHg). Fluid balance shows an input of 2,013 mL (984 mL since 12 AM), output of 2,785 mL (925 mL since 12 AM), and a negative balance of -772 mL (with a range of 59 mL).

The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 135, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 22 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.55, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240. Her minute ventilation (Ve) is 14.8 L/min.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count (WBC) of 37.6-39.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 7.9-8.1 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 24.6-26.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 366-729 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 47 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2-1.3 mg/dL, glucose of 59-89 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pancreatitis, necrotozing, s/p ERCP.  Overall continues gradual
   clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, likely attributed to by
   intra-abdominal pain, acidosis, fluid resussitation, and pleural
   effusions.  CXR stable.  Monitor respiratory status (RR, SaO2, ABG),
   continue mechanical ventilation, maintain AC mode, monitor ABG.
   NEUROGICAL STATUS -- Continues to improve mental status --> likely
   medication related.  Generalized weakness likely reflects critical care
   illness myopathy.
   TACHYCARDIA -- multifactorial, including actue pancreatitis, pain,
   intravascular depletion (third spacing), possible blood loss.  Stable.
   Monitor, treat underlying process.
   HTN -- Variable periods of HTN alternating with normotension or
   relative [**Name (NI) 5305**].  [**Name2 (NI) 11**] be related to level of alertness,
   aggitation/anxiety, or concern for pain.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- s/p resussitation, now tolerating net diuresis.  Desire net
   negative fluid balance to baseline weight.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- ERCP-related.  Responding to current support,
   with good progress.  Mild increase in amylase/lipase --> need to
   monitor.  General Surgery consultation to follow.
   ELEVATED WBC -- attributed to acute pancreatitis.  Now with mounting
   bandemia.  Concern for evolving new infection or infectious
   complication of necrotizing pancreatitis.  Monitor.
   FEVER -- recurrent, possible intra-abdminal inflammation.  However,
   WBC/bandemia may reflect intra-abdominal inflammation or  concern for
   complication of necrotising pancreatitis but no evidence by CT scan.
   Also need to monitor for new infection, such as VAP, C. Diff,
   Line-related, bladder catheter-related  (evaluation in progress).
   Monitor off antimicrobials.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- improved control with insulin in TPN.   Insulin drip.
   Maintain glucose <150.  Monitor for hypoglycemia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, and post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/48 mmHg to 163/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient has elevated white blood cell count and bandemia, which may indicate an evolving new infection or an infectious complication of necrotizing pancreatitis. There is also a concern for complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection, line-related infection, or bladder catheter-related infection. 

The patient's glucose levels are being controlled with insulin in total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and they are receiving TPN with lipids. The patient's renal function is preserved, but it should be monitored along with nutritional support. 

The patient's neurological status is improving, but they still exhibit generalized weakness, likely due to critical care illness myopathy. 

The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, and there is a desire for a net negative fluid balance to the"

The patient's pancreatitis is improving, but surgery believes that she will need a procedure to remove dead pancreas/likely pseudocyst that will form in the center of the pancreas. 

The patient's fevers are trending downward, and her WBC count is also trending down. There are no signs of septic physiology. If the patient clinically worsens, it may be necessary to consider broad-spectrum antibiotics, imaging, and surgery.

The patient's mental status has significantly improved with the withdrawal of midazolam. However, she still has difficulty moving her arms, which could be due to ICU myopathy or residual benzodiazepine effect.

The patient was extubated today and is doing well on a shovel mask. The goal is to diuresis negative 1L and wean off oxygen.

The patient's hypertension has improved, and it is recommended to continue diuresis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with necrotizing pancreatitis. She has been extubated but remains critically ill. The patient is experiencing intermittent fevers, weakness, and difficulty lifting extremities. She has a history of allergies to sulfa, statins, and Naprosyn. The patient is on various medications including insulin, furosemide, morphine, heparin sodium, and a fentanyl patch. Her vital signs are stable, but she has hyperglycemia and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's respiratory function is improving, but she is mildly volume overloaded. The plan is to continue bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), with eventual surgery for the necrotic pancreas in approximately weeks. The patient also needs physical therapy due to weakness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's intermittent fevers may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated, there is a risk of respiratory failure due to her acute respiratory condition.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's persistent hyperglycemia requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels need to be corrected to prevent complications like cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's main complaints are abdominal pain and respiratory failure. 

The patient has undergone ERCP for necrotizing pancreatitis and was recently extubated. She is currently experiencing intermittent fevers and remains on bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Surgery is planned for the necrotic pancreas in approximately two weeks.

The patient also has respiratory failure, which has improved since she was extubated. However, she is still mildly volume overloaded, and efforts are being made to gently diurese her.

The patient is experiencing weakness, particularly since extubation, with difficulty lifting her extremities off the bed. Physical therapy (PT) is recommended.

The patient has hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin through a continuous infusion and in the TPN. There is a plan to transition to subcutaneous insulin and attempt to wean off the insulin infusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's intermittent fevers and history of necrotizing pancreatitis may increase the risk of infection.

2. Respiratory issues: Although the patient has been extubated, there is a risk of further respiratory complications due to her respiratory failure and mild volume overload.

3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's weakness and difficulty lifting extremities may increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

4. Hypoglyc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted with necrotic pancreatitis following an ERCP procedure. She is currently in the ICU and has been electively intubated to allow for fluid resuscitation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/54 mmHg to 146/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on nasal cannula oxygen support.

The patient's recent events include discontinuing fentanyl gel and switching to a fentanyl patch, transitioning to subcutaneous insulin, and having a stable hematocrit. She has several allergies, including sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), statins, and naproxen.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and an unknown allergy to naproxen. Her family history is not mentioned. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvements.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,033 mL and a total output of 1,650 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 617 mL. The patient's weight is currently 71.9 kg, compared to her admission weight of 73 kg.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and has experienced respiratory failure, but was successfully extubated on [**3-18**]. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis appears to be doing well with decreased abdominal pain. However, the patient's WBC (white blood cell) count remains high, which is expected due to the ongoing inflammation. The patient has been taken off antibiotics, and galactomanan levels are still pending.

2. HTN (hypertension): The patient's high blood pressure is currently controlled with medication.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, and the patient has been transitioned to subcutaneous (SQ) insulin for glycemic control.

4. Elevated platelets (Plt): The patient's platelet count is high, which could be a reactive process to pancreatitis. No immediate intervention is required, but the patient's platelet levels should continue to be monitored.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest and immobility in the ICU.

6. Alteration in tissue perfusion: The patient may experience alterations in tissue perfusion due to impaired circulation, potentially resulting from the pancreatitis.

7. Hypernatremia (high sodium levels): The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with necrotizing pancreatitis. She has been in the ICU for a prolonged period and has experienced respiratory failure, which she was extubated on March 18th. The patient's current condition shows improved pancreatitis symptoms, with decreased abdominal pain. Her white blood cell count remains high but is expected due to the ongoing inflammation. She has been taken off antibiotics, and a galactomanan test is still pending. The patient is being kept on bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Her hypertension is controlled with current medications. She is transitioning to subcutaneous insulin for glycemic control. The elevated platelet count is suspected to be a reactive process to pancreatitis, so no immediate intervention is planned, but it will be monitored. The rest of the plan is being managed by the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's pancreatitis appears to be improving, there is still a risk of complications such as infection or abscess formation.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels require close monitoring and management with insulin therapy.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which needs to be corrected to maintain proper bodily functions.
4. Ineffective coping: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and multiple medical issues may lead to ineffective coping mechanisms, potentially resulting in psychological distress or delirium.
5. Respir"
