   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy without
   clear trigger.
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy:  Secondary to ESLD most likely, although
   has not been clearing per his usual course
 despite ammonia decrease
   still encephalopathic.  Urine and Blood cultures negative to date.
   - Lactulose q4 for a goal of 750-1000mL stool output with additional
   doses q1H until stools via NGT until can take PO reliably
   - Continue Rifaximin, Lactobacillus, metoclopramide, mag oxide for
   bowel motility
   - Continue SBP PPx w/ Cipro PO
   - Aspiration precautions, hold nasal CPAP while obtunded as not
   hypercarbic and at risk for aspiration, Intubated for now.
   - Branched chain amino acids per liver team
   .
   # Aspiration Event:  Likely aspiration pneumonitis.  ABG does not show
   hypercarbia even though patient is obtunded.  Likely altered mental
   status is all related to encephalopathy.
   - starting vanco, zosyn for HAP and flagyl for aspiration treatment,
   will continue to monitor for low grade fevers,  and trend leukocytosis
   - intubated for airway protection.
   - Aspiration precautions, HOB elevated
   - NGT in place
   - Consider Trach/PEG given repeated aspiration events
   # New Leukocytosis
 unclear source
   - pan culture urine, blood, sputum, stool
 flagyl also started for
   aspiration will cover c.diff
   - LP to rule out meningitis as cause of AMS
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 likely secondary to NS boluses and high osmotic stool
   output.  Patient has both a free water deficit of approximately 4 L,
   but due to his cirrhosis and stool is intravascularly dry as well.
   Needs both free water and NS for intravascular repletion.
   - stabilized at 156 this morning
   - will run 0.5 NS at 125 cc/ hr
   - monitor lytes tid with goal of no more than 12 point Na change over
   24 hrs.
   .
   # ESLD. [**1-22**] EtOH and HCV. Ascites, peripheral edema, history of
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary
   hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.  Patient requires
   liver transplant
   - Lactulose and rifaximin as above.
   - Cipro for SBP ppx
   - Continue Nadolol
   - holding diuretics of lasix and spironolactone
   .
   # Anemia: Known Grade II varices s/p banding without evidence active
   bleeding and stable Hct. Chronically G+ stool, chronic. No clear
   source.
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct daily
   - PPI
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-22**] liver disease. Platelets within baseline.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 88mcg PO daily.
   .
   # Pulmonary HTN:  On iloprost and modafinil at baseline.  Hold while
   Intubated
   .
   # OSA:  Currently Intubated.  Nasal CPAP only as needed for
   hypercarbia, however recent ABG does not show signs of hypercarbia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and a history of liver disease. The patient has been experiencing severe diarrhea, resulting in significant fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances. He has also shown signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's condition has been complicated by the development of decerebrate posturing and non-responsive behavior. Imaging studies have not revealed any acute changes or evidence of cerebral vascular accident. The patient's respiratory status is being supported with mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe dehydration: The patient's stool output has been estimated at ""liters"" per hour, leading to a significant fluid deficit. This can result in severe dehydration and potentially life-threatening complications if not corrected promptly.
2. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with low sodium (Na+), low potassium (K+), and elevated chloride (Cl-). These imbalances can disrupt normal cellular function and contribute to various complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and kidney dysfunction.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of liver disease and elevated liver enzymes suggest possible hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and even coma if not managed appropriately.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CR"

   - Branched chain amino acids per liver team
   .
   # ESLD. [**1-22**] EtOH and HCV. Ascites, peripheral edema, history of
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary
   hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.  Patient requires
   liver transplant
   - Lactulose and rifaximin as above.
   - Cipro for SBP ppx

   bleeding and stable Hct. Chronically G+ stool, chronic. No clear
   source.
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct daily
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI
   - consider colonoscopy as inpatient
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-22**] liver disease. Platelets within baseline.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 88mcg PO daily.
   .
   # Pulmonary HTN:  On iloprost and modafinil at baseline.  Hold while
   Intubated

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy without
   clear trigger.
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy:  Secondary to ESLD.  Urine and Blood
   cultures negative to date.
   - Lactulose q4 for a goal of 750-1000mL stool output with additional
   doses q1H until stools via NGT until can take PO reliably
   - Continue Rifaximin, Lactobacillus, metoclopramide, mag oxide for
   bowel motility
   - Continue SBP PPx w/ Cipro PO
   - Aspiration precautions, hold nasal CPAP while obtunded as not
   hypercarbic and at risk for aspiration, Intubated for now.
   - Branched chain amino acids per liver team
   .
   # Aspiration Event:  Likely aspiration pneumonitis.  ABG does not show
   hypercarbia even though patient is obtunded.  Likely altered mental
   status is all related to encephalopathy.
   - Will intubate for airway protection.
   - Likely able to wean ventilation overnight
   - Aspiration precautions, HOB elevated
   - NGT in place
   - Consider Trach/PEG given repeated aspiration events
   .
   .
   # ESLD. [**1-22**] EtOH and HCV. Ascites, peripheral edema, history of
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary
   hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.  Patient requires
   liver transplant
   - Lactulose and rifaximin as above.
   - Cipro for SBP ppx
   - Continue Nadolol and spironolactone
   .
   # Anemia: Known Grade II varices s/p banding without evidence active
   bleeding and stable Hct. Chronically G+ stool, chronic. No clear
   source.
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct daily
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI
   - consider colonoscopy as inpatient
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-22**] liver disease. Platelets within baseline.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 88mcg PO daily.
   .
   # Pulmonary HTN:  On iloprost and modafinil at baseline.  Hold while
   Intubated
   .
   # OSA:  Currently Intubated.  Nasal CPAP only as needed for
   hypercarbia, however recent ABG does not show signs of hypercarbia.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, No IVF, replete 'lytes prn
   # PPX: pneumoboots, IV PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL
   # Dispo: Once Encephalopathy improves.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use and hepatitis C. He presents with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. The patient has a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy. He requires a liver transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and previous episodes of encephalopathy put him at risk for recurrent episodes, which can be secondary to ESLD (end-stage liver disease).
2. Aspiration event: The patient likely experienced aspiration pneumonitis, as indicated by altered mental status and the need for intubation. There is a risk of further aspiration events, especially while the patient is obtunded.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of liver disease, which can cause thrombocytopenia due to splenic sequestration and decreased production of thrombopoietin by the liver.
4. Anemia: The patient has known grade II varices that were previously banded without evidence of active bleeding. Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss could lead to anemia.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, which needs to be continued and monitored.
6. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient is on iloprost and mod"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and difficulty with breathing. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to deteriorating health. 

24-hour events include the removal of an endotracheal tube, increased free water boluses, intermittent responsiveness to voice, and presence of gram-positive cocci in the sputum. The patient's neurological exam shows decreased responsiveness and decerebrate posturing. 

The patient has allergies to amoxicillin, adhesive bandage (topical), and dicloxacillin. The last dose of antibiotics administered was vancomycin, cefipime, and metronidazole. 

Vital signs show fever, increased heart rate, stable blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 6,809 mL total input and 4,610 mL total output. 

Respiratory support includes the use of an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation, set at a tidal volume of 905 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

Physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, scleral icterus, bilateral rhonchi in the lungs, regular heart sounds without murmur, abdominal distention with tympanitic sounds and shifting dullness, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows non-res"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy without
   clear trigger.
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy:  Secondary to ESLD most likely, although
   has not been clearing per his usual course
 despite ammonia decrease
   still encephalopathic.  Urine and Blood cultures negative to date.
   - Lactulose q4 for a goal of 750-1000mL stool output with additional
   doses q1H until stools via NGT until can take PO reliably
   - Continue Rifaximin, Lactobacillus, metoclopramide, mag oxide for
   bowel motility
   - Continue SBP PPx w/ Cipro PO
   - Aspiration precautions, hold nasal CPAP while obtunded as not
   hypercarbic and at risk for aspiration, Intubated for now.
   - Branched chain amino acids per liver team
   .
   # Aspiration Event:  Likely aspiration pneumonitis.  ABG does not show
   hypercarbia even though patient is obtunded.  Likely altered mental
   status is all related to encephalopathy.
   - starting vanco, zosyn for HAP and flagyl for aspiration treatment,
   will continue to monitor for low grade fevers,  and trend leukocytosis
   - intubated for airway protection.
   - Aspiration precautions, HOB elevated
   - NGT in place
   - Consider Trach/PEG given repeated aspiration events
   # New Leukocytosis
 unclear source
   - pan culture urine, blood, sputum, stool
 flagyl also started for
   aspiration will cover c.diff
   - LP to rule out meningitis as cause of AMS
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 likely secondary to NS boluses and high osmotic stool
   output.  Patient has both a free water deficit of approximately 4 L,
   but due to his cirrhosis and stool is intravascularly dry as well.
   Needs both free water and NS for intravascular repletion.
   - stabilized at 156 this morning
   - will run 0.5 NS at 125 cc/ hr
   - monitor lytes tid with goal of no more than 12 point Na change over
   24 hrs.
   .
   # ESLD. [**1-22**] EtOH and HCV. Ascites, peripheral edema, history of
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary
   hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.  Patient requires
   liver transplant
   - Lactulose and rifaximin as above.
   - Cipro for SBP ppx
   - Continue Nadolol
   - holding diuretics of lasix and spironolactone
   .
   # Anemia: Known Grade II varices s/p banding without evidence active
   bleeding and stable Hct. Chronically G+ stool, chronic. No clear
   source.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and hepatitis C. He has a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary hypertension, encephalopathy, and sleep apnea. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for encephalopathy without a clear trigger. He is intubated due to aspiration events and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and previous episodes of encephalopathy indicate a high risk for recurrent encephalopathy. This can be managed with lactulose, rifaximin, metoclopramide, and magnesium oxide.
2. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient has had multiple aspiration events, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonitis. He is already receiving appropriate treatment with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to NS boluses and high osmotic stool output. Close monitoring and careful fluid management are required to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
4. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient requires a liver transplant due to his advanced liver disease. Ongoing management includes lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy prevention.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic G+ stool and anemia. Active"

   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy without
   clear trigger.
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy:  Secondary to ESLD most likely, although
   has not been clearing per his usual course
 but yesterday evening
   started waking up.  Continues to be intubated this morning.  Waiting
   for extubation because lactulose was held overnight to decrease
   diarrhea in hopes of helping his hypernatremia.  His ammonia level this
   morning remained low.
   - Trial of extubation today
   - Restarting lactulose and monitoring stool output
   - long term plan re: liver is to do spleno-renal embolization to
   improve blood flow to liver in hopes of some metabolic breakdown prior
   to blood reaching brain
   - Continue Rifaximin, Lactobacillus, metoclopramide, mag oxide for
   bowel motility
   - Continue SBP PPx w/ Cipro PO
   - Aspiration precautions, hold nasal CPAP while obtunded as not
   hypercarbic and at risk for aspiration.
   .
   # Aspiration Event:  Likely aspiration pneumonitis v. pneumonia as pt
   had leukocytosis and mild fever.  Sputum gram stain showed GP cocci in
   clusters, chains and pairs.
   - cont vanco/cefepime day 1 [**1-27**].  stopped Flagyl today as is not
   indicated in aspiration.  Patient has no teeth and likely does not have
   anaerobe infection.
   - being extubated today
   - Aspiration precautions, HOB elevated
   - NGT in place
   # Leukocytosis
 likely pneumonitis related
   - cultures negative so far except gram stain on sputum with GP coccis
   - cont vanco/cefepime
   - cont cipro for SBP ppx
   - LP deferred yesterday as mental status improved
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 likely secondary to NS boluses and high osmotic stool
   output.  Improving.  Lactulose held yesterday to decrease stool output.
   - Na 149 this morning down from 156
   - will start D5W and stop 0.5 NS as likely is no longer intravascularly
   dry
   - monitor lytes tid with goal of no more than 12 point Na change over
   24 hrs.
   .
   # ESLD. [**1-22**] EtOH and HCV. Ascites, peripheral edema, history of
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary
   hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.  Patient requires
   liver transplant.  Liver team following.
   - INR, T.bili higher today, will continue to monitor, no change in
   treatment at this time.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin as above.
   - Cipro for SBP ppx
   - Continue Nadolol
   - holding diuretics of lasix and spironolactone

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy without
   clear trigger.
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy:  Secondary to ESLD most likely, although
   has not been clearing per his usual course
 despite ammonia decrease
   still encephalopathic.  Urine and Blood cultures negative to date.
   - Lactulose q4 for a goal of 750-1000mL stool output with additional
   doses q1H until stools via NGT until can take PO reliably
   - Continue Rifaximin, Lactobacillus, metoclopramide, mag oxide for
   bowel motility
   - Continue SBP PPx w/ Cipro PO
   - Aspiration precautions, hold nasal CPAP while obtunded as not
   hypercarbic and at risk for aspiration, Intubated for now.
   - Branched chain amino acids per liver team
   .
   # Aspiration Event:  Likely aspiration pneumonitis.  ABG does not show
   hypercarbia even though patient is obtunded.  Likely altered mental
   status is all related to encephalopathy.
   - starting vanco, zosyn for HAP and flagyl for aspiration treatment,
   will continue to monitor for low grade fevers,  and trend leukocytosis
   - intubated for airway protection.
   - Aspiration precautions, HOB elevated
   - NGT in place
   - Consider Trach/PEG given repeated aspiration events
   # New Leukocytosis
 unclear source
   - pan culture urine, blood, sputum, stool
 flagyl also started for
   aspiration will cover c.diff
   - LP to rule out meningitis as cause of AMS
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 likely secondary to NS boluses and high osmotic stool
   output.  Patient has both a free water deficit of approximately 4 L,
   but due to his cirrhosis and stool is intravascularly dry as well.
   Needs both free water and NS for intravascular repletion.
   - stabilized at 156 this morning
   - will run 0.5 NS at 125 cc/ hr
   - monitor lytes tid with goal of no more than 12 point Na change over
   24 hrs.
   .
   # ESLD. [**1-22**] EtOH and HCV. Ascites, peripheral edema, history of
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary
   hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.  Patient requires
   liver transplant
   - Lactulose and rifaximin as above.
   - Cipro for SBP ppx
   - Continue Nadolol
   - holding diuretics of lasix and spironolactone
   .
   # Anemia: Known Grade II varices s/p banding without evidence active
   bleeding and stable Hct. Chronically G+ stool, chronic. No clear

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH and HCV, recurrent episodes of encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), portal hypertension (PAH), sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy. He presents with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. The patient has been intubated for airway protection due to an aspiration event and likely aspiration pneumonitis. He is also on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. There are concerns about hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and liver failure. The patient requires a liver transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent encephalopathy: The patient's history of severe encephalopathy suggests that he is at risk for recurrent episodes, which can be secondary to ESLD (end-stage liver disease).
2. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's altered mental status and repeated aspiration events increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of SBP and is currently on antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration. The presence of leukocytosis and positive sputum gram stain indicates a possible infection.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy may worsen due to the underlying liver disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple medical complications. 

24-hour events include the removal of an endotracheal tube, increased free water boluses, and intermittent responsiveness to voice. The patient's sodium levels remain elevated at 156, indicating persistent hypernatremia. A sputum gram stain showed 4+ gram-positive cocci, and the patient is now on vancomycin. 

The patient's neurological examination revealed non-responsiveness to voice, decerebrate posturing to pain, fixed and dilated pupils, absent corneal reflexes, and a down-going Babinski sign. A stat head CT showed no changes, ruling out cerebral vascular accident (CVA). 

The patient has several allergies, including amoxicillin, adhesive bandage (topical), and dicloxacillin. 

Infusions include other ICU medications, and the patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/59 mmHg to 159/131 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Fluid balance indicates an intake of 6,809 mL and output of 2,199 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,610 mL. The patient requires respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 905 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels. Glucose levels are elevated, with a range of 77-184 mg/dL. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is experiencing multiple medical complications, including electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired balance, impaired motor function, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired transfers, tachycardia, diarrhea, skull fracture, hepatic encephalopathy, and risk for aspiration due to inability to protect airway. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status and difficulty protecting his airway. The patient has a history of liver disease, including hepatomegaly and cirrhosis. He also has a history of alcohol abuse. The patient underwent a splenorenal shunt but required extubation due to improvement in mental status and ability to protect his airway. The patient's sodium levels were initially low but are now resolving with the use of free water flushes. His lactulose dose was reduced from 60 cc every 4 hours to 30 cc every 4 hours, and Flagyl was discontinued. The patient has a PICC line in place for medication administration, and a speech and swallow evaluation is pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of liver disease and the presence of altered mental status suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can lead to confusion, disorientation, and even coma if left untreated.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's initial intubation and subsequent extubation indicate respiratory issues. The risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex may still exist, increasing the potential for respiratory complications such as pneumonia.
3. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to liver disease and medication use, making him susceptible to infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy without
   clear trigger.
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy:  Secondary to ESLD most likely, although
   has not been clearing per his usual course
 but yesterday evening
   started waking up.  Continues to be intubated this morning.  Waiting
   for extubation because lactulose was held overnight to decrease
   diarrhea in hopes of helping his hypernatremia.  His ammonia level this
   morning remained low.
   - Trial of extubation today
   - Restarting lactulose and monitoring stool output
   - long term plan re: liver is to do spleno-renal embolization to
   improve blood flow to liver in hopes of some metabolic breakdown prior
   to blood reaching brain
   - Continue Rifaximin, Lactobacillus, metoclopramide, mag oxide for
   bowel motility
   - Continue SBP PPx w/ Cipro PO
   - Aspiration precautions, hold nasal CPAP while obtunded as not
   hypercarbic and at risk for aspiration.
   .
   # Aspiration Event:  Likely aspiration pneumonitis v. pneumonia as pt
   had leukocytosis and mild fever.  Sputum gram stain showed GP cocci in
   clusters, chains and pairs.
   - cont vanco/cefepime day 1 [**1-27**].  stopped Flagyl today as is not
   indicated in aspiration.  Patient has no teeth and likely does not have
   anaerobe infection.
   - being extubated today
   - Aspiration precautions, HOB elevated
   - NGT in place
   # Leukocytosis
 likely pneumonitis related
   - cultures negative so far except gram stain on sputum with GP coccis
   - cont vanco/cefepime
   - cont cipro for SBP ppx
   - LP deferred yesterday as mental status improved
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 likely secondary to NS boluses and high osmotic stool
   output.  Improving.  Lactulose held yesterday to decrease stool output.
   - Na 149 this morning down from 156
   - will start D5W and stop 0.5 NS as likely is no longer intravascularly
   dry
   - monitor lytes tid with goal of no more than 12 point Na change over
   24 hrs.
   .
   # ESLD. [**1-22**] EtOH and HCV. Ascites, peripheral edema, history of
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary
   hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.  Patient requires
   liver transplant.  Liver team following.
   - INR, T.bili higher today, will continue to monitor, no change in
   treatment at this time.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin as above.
   - Cipro for SBP ppx
   - Continue Nadolol
   - holding diuretics of lasix and spironolactone
   .
   # Anemia: Known Grade II varices s/p banding without evidence active
   bleeding and stable Hct. Chronically G+ stool, chronic. No clear
   source.
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct daily
   - PPI
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-22**] liver disease. Platelets within baseline.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 88mcg PO daily.
   .
   # Pulmonary HTN:  On iloprost and modafinil at baseline.  Consider
   restarting as he returns closer to baseline after extubation.  Will
   monitor pulm status this afternoone.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and hepatitis C. He has a past medical history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), portal hypertension (PAH), and encephalopathy. The patient presented with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger and was intubated. His ammonia level remained low despite holding lactulose overnight. The plan is to restart lactulose and monitor stool output, as well as continue with long-term plans for liver management, including spleno-renal shunt embolization.

The patient also had an aspiration event likely due to aspiration pneumonitis rather than pneumonia. The sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, chains, and pairs. Vancomycin and cefepime were continued, and Flagyl was stopped because it is not indicated in aspiration cases.

There was leukocytosis likely related to pneumonitis. Cultures were negative except for the gram stain on sputum. The patient is being extubated today, and aspiration precautions will be taken, including elevating the head of bed (HOB) and using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).

The patient had hypernatremia, which is improving, possibly due to NS boluses and high osmotic stool output. Lactulose was held to decrease stool output, and the plan is to start D5W and"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy without
   clear trigger.
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy:  Secondary to ESLD most likely, although
   has not been clearing per his usual course, awoken yesterday and
   intubated around 10 am yesterday morning.
   - Cont lactulose and monitoring stool output
   - Today will have spleno renal embolization in IR with anesthesia.  NPO
   until then.  Hopefully will be able to be extubated after the procedure
   and return to ICU for monitoring
   - Continue Rifaximin, Lactobacillus, metoclopramide, mag oxide for
   bowel motility
   - Hold cipro SBP ppx until off cefepime
   .
   # Aspiration Event:  Likely aspiration pneumonitis v. pneumonia as pt
   had leukocytosis and mild fever.  Sputum gram stain showed GP cocci in
   clusters, chains and pairs.  Cx growing only oropharyngeal flora
   - cont vanco/cefepime day  3 of 7.  stopped Flagyl on [**1-23**] as is not
   indicated in aspiration.  Patient has no teeth and likely does not have
   anaerobe infection.
   - now stable on 2L NC, did have desat and requirement of 100% face mask
   last night for short period of time, continue pulmonary toilet as
   needed
   - Aspiration precautions, HOB elevated
 patient with very poor cough,
   almost no gag reflex
   - NGT in place
   # Leukocytosis
 likely pneumonitis related
   - cont vanco/cefepime
   - holding cipro until cefepime stopped
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 likely secondary to NS boluses and high osmotic stool
   output.  Improved

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, secondary to alcohol abuse and HCV infection. He has a background of SBP, portal hypertension, and PAH, and presents with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. The patient was intubated yesterday morning and continues to be on mechanical ventilation. His current condition includes recurrent encephalopathy, aspiration event, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, ESLD, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, pulmonary hypertension, and OSA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and ESLD increases the risk of recurrent encephalopathy. Monitoring stool output and continuing lactulose are appropriate measures to manage this condition.

2. Aspiration Event: The patient's lack of cough reflex and gag reflex put him at risk for further aspiration events. Aspiration precautions, such as elevating the head of bed and providing pulmonary toilet, are essential to prevent further complications.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count indicates an ongoing inflammatory response. Continuing vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics is necessary to address any potential infection.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may be due to NS boluses and high osmotic stool output. Close monitoring of electrolytes and adjusting fluid intake accordingly is"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy, currently not encephalopathic.
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy:  Secondary to ESLD most likely, although
   has not been clearing per his usual course, currently resolved. Patient
   failed IR guided spleno renal embolization yesterday, procedure was
   done in attempt to reduce encephalopathy.
   - Cont lactulose and monitoring stool output
   - Continue Rifaximin, Lactobacillus, metoclopramide, mag oxide for
   bowel motility
   - Hold cipro SBP ppx until off cefepime
   .
   # Aspiration Event:  Likely aspiration pneumonitis v. pneumonia as pt
   had leukocytosis and mild fever.  Sputum gram stain showed GP cocci in
   clusters, chains and pairs.  Cx growing only oropharyngeal flora
   - cont vanco/cefepime day  3 of 7.  stopped Flagyl on [**1-23**] as is not
   indicated in aspiration.  Patient has no teeth and likely does not have
   anaerobe infection.
   - now stable on 2L NC, did have desat and requirement of 100% face mask
   last night for short period of time, continue pulmonary toilet as
   needed
   - Aspiration precautions, HOB elevated
 patient with very poor cough,
   almost no gag reflex
   - NGT in place
   # Leukocytosis
 likely pneumonitis related

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH and HCV. He has a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), portal and pulmonary hypertension, recurrent episodes of encephalopathy, and is currently not encephalopathic. The patient failed interventional radiology (IR) guided spleno-renal embolization yesterday, which was done to reduce encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of recurrent encephalopathy, which is likely secondary to end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Monitoring stool output and continuing lactulose and rifaximin are recommended.
2. Aspiration Event: The patient likely experienced aspiration pneumonitis rather than pneumonia. He has leukocytosis and a mild fever, and sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, chains, and pairs. Vancomycin and cefepime have been continued for 4 days.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely related to pneumonitis. Antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) will be continued.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely secondary to NS boluses and high osmotic stool output. His sodium level improved, and he will continue to receive lactulose.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 year old gentleman with a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH +
   HCV, hx of SBP and portal and PAH, w/ recurrent episodes of
   enceophalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy without
   clear trigger.
   .
   # Recurrent encephalopathy:  Secondary to ESLD most likely, although
   has not been clearing per his usual course, awoken yesterday and
   intubated around 10 am yesterday morning.
   - Cont lactulose and monitoring stool output
   - Today will have spleno renal embolization in IR with anesthesia.  NPO
   until then.  Hopefully will be able to be extubated after the procedure
   and return to ICU for monitoring
   - Continue Rifaximin, Lactobacillus, metoclopramide, mag oxide for
   bowel motility
   - Hold cipro SBP ppx until off cefepime
   .
   # Aspiration Event:  Likely aspiration pneumonitis v. pneumonia as pt
   had leukocytosis and mild fever.  Sputum gram stain showed GP cocci in
   clusters, chains and pairs.  Cx growing only oropharyngeal flora
   - cont vanco/cefepime day  3 of 7.  stopped Flagyl on [**1-23**] as is not
   indicated in aspiration.  Patient has no teeth and likely does not have
   anaerobe infection.
   - now stable on 2L NC, did have desat and requirement of 100% face mask
   last night for short period of time, continue pulmonary toilet as
   needed
   - Aspiration precautions, HOB elevated
 patient with very poor cough,
   almost no gag reflex
   - NGT in place
   # Leukocytosis
 likely pneumonitis related
   - cont vanco/cefepime
   - holding cipro until cefepime stopped
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 likely secondary to NS boluses and high osmotic stool
   output.  Improved
   - Na 141 this morning
   - continuing lactulose for now so will continue to have high stool
   output, will give D5W as needed IV as his free water flushes have been
   stopped while NPO for the procedure.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # ESLD. [**1-22**] EtOH and HCV. Ascites, peripheral edema, history of
   spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal and pulmonary
   hypertension, sleep apnea, and severe encephalopathy.  Patient requires
   liver transplant.  Liver team following.
   - LFTs stable today from yesterday.
   - Lactulose and rifaximin as above.
   - Continue Nadolol with stricter holding parameters as BPs slightly low
   into the 80s after receiving dose this morning
   - holding diuretics of lasix and spironolactone
   .
   # Anemia: Known Grade II varices s/p banding without evidence active
   bleeding and stable Hct. Chronically G+ stool, chronic. No clear
   source.
   - Active type and screen
   - Hct daily, low of 22 today, will continue to monitor.
   - PPI
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: [**1-22**] liver disease. Platelets within baseline.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 88mcg PO daily.
   .
   # Pulmonary HTN:  On iloprost and modafinil at baseline.  Takes his
   home iloprost, so will talk with mom about whether or not she can bring
   it in to help.
   .
   # OSA:  Uses CPAP at night, can start tonight if continues to be stable
   s/p extubation.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, No IVF, replete 'lytes prn
   # Access
 PICC placed [**1-23**]
   # PPX: pneumoboots, IV PPI, bowel regimen
   # Code: FULL
   # Dispo: Once Encephalopathy improves.

The patient presents with an episode of encephalopathy without a clear trigger. He was intubated yesterday morning and is currently in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of severe encephalopathy and is currently experiencing another episode. It is likely secondary to end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Treatment includes lactulose and monitoring stool output.
2. Aspiration Event: The patient likely aspirated due to poor cough and gag reflex. There is evidence of leukocytosis and mild fever. The sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, chains, and pairs. Current treatment includes vancomycin and cefepime.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely secondary to sodium boluses and high osmotic stool output. Treatment includes D5W as needed IV and monitoring electrolytes.
4. ESLD: The patient requires a liver transplant due to ESLD caused by alcohol abuse and hepatitis C. He has ascites, peripheral edema, and a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, portal hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension.
5. Anemia: The patient has known"
