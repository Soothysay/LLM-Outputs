   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Hypotension/syncope:</I> Likely due to volume depletion in
   setting of diarrhea, also possible this is early sepsis.  Pt presented
   recently with gram negative bacteremia with little or now symptoms,
   will have low threshold to consider sepsis.  Other possible etiologies
   for hypotension = MI, no ecg changes, no CP.  PE less likely and have
   better explanation in setting of high volume diarrhea and ongoing
   dialysis.
   -IVF, bolus to BP as does not make urine, cautious with hydration given
   ESRD.  Goal BP >95 and pt asymptomatic.
   -Continue ROMI
   -hold ativan for now.

   <I>## Diarrhea:</I>Pt at high risk for c. diff given recent
   hospitalization and ongoing IV abx for her bacteremia.  Other possible
   etiologies are antibiotic associated vs a manifestation of
   sepsis/bacteremia.
   -treatment for severe c.diff given degree of fluid refractory
   hypotension on pressors with PO vancomycin and IV flagy
   -blood cultures daily
   -send fluid from PD for culture and gram stain
   -hydration as above
   -Give one dose IV vanc
   -continue ceftaz (usually given with HD, gave one dose overnight)
   -Check LFTs, TSH
   -Check KUB tonight, r/o toxic megacolon/free air.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). She presented with two weeks of diarrhea and hypotension/dizziness, likely due to volume depletion or early sepsis. The patient recently had gram-negative bacteremia without symptoms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Syncope: The patient's hypotension could be attributed to volume depletion from diarrhea or early sepsis. It is important to monitor her blood pressure and consider sepsis as a possible etiology. The patient is at a high risk for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection given recent hospitalization and IV antibiotic use. Treatment for severe C. diff has been initiated with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl. Daily blood cultures and fluid from PD for culture and gram stain will be sent. Hydration should be maintained cautiously due to ESRD.

2. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be caused by C. diff, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, or a manifestation of sepsis/bacteremia. Severe C. diff has been treated with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl. Blood cultures will be taken daily, and fluid from PD will be cultured and gram-stained.

3. ESRD: The patient receives both HD and PD. Dialysis plans need to be arranged for Friday, and PD"

   diarrhea in setting of abx use with hypotension/dizziness.
   .
   <I>PLAN:</I>
   .
   <I>## Hypotension/syncope:</I> Likely due to volume depletion in
   setting of diarrhea and flux in fluid status with PD/HD. Patient is
   symptomatic this AM and receiving fluid boluses. Other considerations
   are cardiac tamponade given distant heart sounds, not previously noted.
   This is a reasonable consideration in a patient with renal failure.
   Sepsis is also a possibility as patient has both C. diff and a history
   of GNR bacteremia, on appropriate medications for both. Currently,
   culture data does not support bacteremia and patient is afebrile with a
   normal WBC.
   -IVF boluses to maintain MAP of 60 and or to avoid symptoms
   -Discussed adding fluid back with PD with renal. Await renal recs
   -EKG and if abnormal, consider TTE
   -Will send off additional set of CEs
   -F/U cultures
   -A line if hypotension persists
   -Consider groin CVL with pressors as last resort
   .
   <I>## Diarrhea:</I>C. diff confirmed on cultures. Currently on PO
   Vancomycin and Flagyl. WBC normal and no fever, but continued stooling.
   KUB shows no megacolon or free air.
   -Continue abx
   -Continue hydration as above
   .
   <I>## ESRD:</I>Gets HD M/F, also PD; PD fluid negative for infection
   -Plan to run patient even to positive with PD; Follow-up official renal
   recs
   -Continue lanthanum, sevelamer, renagel, sensipar, fosrenol,
   paricalcitol (with HD)
   .
   <I>## HTN:</I>Hold all antihypertensives while BPs low.
   .
   <I>## OSA:</I>CPAP
   .
   <I>## H/O GNR bacteremia:</I>Continue to monitor blood cultures.
   -Continue Ceftazidime for planned course
   .
   <I>## Depression:</I>
   -Continue Celexa
   .
   <I>## Anemia:</I>
   -Continue EPO and Iron infusions with dialysis.

   -Continue Gabapentin
   .
   <I>## Functional SVC syndrome:</I> Pt's symptoms of facial and breast
   swelling may be more a manifestation of this rather than true fluid
   overload.
   -Should hypotention continue and a CVL is foreseeable, will hold
   Coumadin and start Heparin gtt. Otherwise, therapeutic on Coumadin and

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), presenting with symptoms of hypotension and dizziness. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea for two weeks and is currently on antibiotics for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 74/39 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP. Physical examination reveals periorbital edema, bilateral breast edema, and no signs of lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as anemia and low albumin. The patient's WBC count is within normal limits, indicating no active infection. The assessment and plan include managing hypotension and syncope, addressing diarrhea caused by C. diff, ongoing care for ESRD, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, history of GNR bacteremia, depression, anemia, post-herpetic neuralgia, functional superior vena cava syndrome, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and she"

   on anticoagulation, recent line infection with E. cloacae on
   ceftazidime admitted with hypotension and diarrhea.  She is C. diff
   positive and continues to have symptomatic hypotension.
   1)       Hypotension due to hypovolemic +/- septic shock
 likely
   secondary to hypovolemia related to ongoing diarrhea and septic
   physiology.  However, she is experiencing L shoulder pain radiating
   across her chest and has distant heart sounds.  No signs of blood
   loss.  She is therapeutically anticoagulated making PE unlikely.  We
   will check BP in all four extremities and consider a-line placement if
   unable to get accurate pressures.  Continue IVF boluses as there are
   currently no signs of volume overload.  Will obtain EKG and perhaps
   echocardiogram if there are abnormalities.  Will send another set of
   cardiac markers.  She may need re-initiation of peripheral dopamine.
   Central line placement would be complicated by INR 2.6 but may be
   necessary.  MAP goal > 60.
   2)       C. Diff
 Continue po vancomycin and IV flagyl.
   3)       E. cloacae Bacteremia
 Contine ceftazidime.
   4)       SVC syndrome
 Currently on coumadin with INR 2.6, which is
   not ideal in her current situation (C. diff, antibiotics, hypotension
   with potential need for procedures).  If we have not stabilized her
   prior to evening dose, we will hold this medication and start heparin
   drip when INR 2.0.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), transitioning from hemodialysis (HD) to peritoneal dialysis (PD), SVC syndrome secondary to clots receiving anticoagulation, and a recent line infection with E. cloacae treated with ceftazidime. She was admitted with hypotension causing syncope in the setting of diarrhea. Since admission, she has been found to be Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive and is receiving Flagyl and oral vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypotension: The patient is experiencing ongoing symptomatic hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia related to ongoing diarrhea and septic physiology. It is important to monitor blood pressure in all four extremities and consider arterial line placement if accurate pressures cannot be obtained. IV fluid boluses should continue, and an echocardiogram may be necessary to evaluate for any cardiac abnormalities. Re-initiation of peripheral dopamine may also be required.

2) C. Diff: The patient has a positive C. diff status and should continue with oral vancomycin and IV flagyl.

3) E. cloacae Bacteremia: Continue ceftazidime for the treatment of E. cloacae bacteremia.

4) SVC syndrome: The patient is currently on coumadin with an INR of 2.6, which is"

   shoulder pain radiating across her chest and has distant heart sounds.
   No signs of blood loss.  She is therapeutically anticoagulated making
   PE unlikely.  We will check BP in all four extremities and consider
   a-line placement if unable to get accurate pressures.  Continue IVF
   boluses as there are currently no signs of volume overload.  Will
   obtain EKG and perhaps echocardiogram if there are abnormalities.  Will
   send another set of cardiac markers.  She may need re-initiation of
   peripheral dopamine.  Central line placement would be complicated by

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who is transitioning from hemodialysis (HD) to peritoneal dialysis (PD). She has several medical conditions including SVC syndrome secondary to clots and is on anticoagulation therapy. She also has a recent line infection with E. cloacae and is currently receiving treatment with ceftazidime. The patient was admitted with hypotension and diarrhea and has been found to be positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). She is experiencing ongoing symptomatic hypotension despite receiving IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be secondary to hypovolemia related to ongoing diarrhea and septic physiology. Given her symptoms of L shoulder pain radiating across her chest and distant heart sounds, it is important to rule out other causes such as myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. The patient's therapeutic anticoagulation makes pulmonary embolism unlikely. Close monitoring of blood pressure in all four extremities and consideration of arterial line placement if accurate pressures cannot be obtained are recommended. IV fluid boluses should continue as there are no signs of volume overload. An EKG and possibly an echocardiogram should be obtained if abnormalities are present. Re-initiation of peripheral dopamine may be necessary. Central line placement might be complicated by the patient's elevated INR,"

   are cardiac tamponade given distant heart sounds, not previously noted.
   This is a reasonable consideration in a patient with renal failure.
   Sepsis is also a possibility as patient has both C. diff and a history
   of GNR bacteremia, on appropriate medications for both. Currently,
   culture data does not support bacteremia and patient is afebrile with a
   normal WBC.
   -IVF boluses to maintain MAP of 60 and or to avoid symptoms
   -Discussed adding fluid back with PD with renal. Await renal recs
   -EKG and if abnormal, consider TTE

   -A line if hypotension persists
   -Consider groin CVL with pressors as last resort

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) presenting with 2 weeks of diarrhea in the setting of antibiotic use, resulting in hypotension and dizziness. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate 75 bpm, blood pressure 97/48 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%. 

The patient's physical examination shows awake, alert, and NAD (nothing abnormal detected). There is periorbital edema, a thick neck with jugular venous distention (JVD), multiple prior line placement scars, bilateral breath edema (more on the right side), distant heart sounds, no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds appreciated, soft abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly, and no rebound or guarding. The patient also has dependent upper extremity pitting edema bilaterally, no lower extremity edema, and no rashes or lesions noted on the skin. Neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.2 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.4 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 531 thousand/mm³, creatinine (Cr) of 10.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 80 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including potassium (K+) of 27 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 102 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 28%, bicarbonate (HCO3) of 6.6 mEq/L, magnesium (Mg++) of 1.4 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) of 8.0 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) of 3.5 mg/dL. The peritoneal fluid analysis shows a WBC count of 56 cells/mm³ with 49% polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), but no organisms on gram stain. The blood culture is negative, and the stool test is positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypotension/syncope: Likely due to volume depletion in the setting of diarrhea and flux in fluid status with PD/HD. IV fluid boluses will be given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 and avoid symptoms. PD will be decreased, and blood cultures will be followed up. If hypotension persists, an arterial line may be placed.
2. Diarrhea: C. diff confirmed on cultures. The patient is currently on oral vancomycin and intravenous (IV) Flagyl. A planned 2"

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of hypotension, diarrhea, and peritoneal dialysis (PD)/hemodialysis (HD). The patient received 1 liter of normal saline (NS) with HD and decreased PD to 2 bags for the day. He also received 3 liters of NS over the day to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 60 and relieve previous symptoms of lightheadedness. Coumadin was held due to the patient being therapeutic and in case a central venous line (CVL) would need to be placed, allowing for easier reversal. Repeat computed tomography (CT) scans were done given complaints of abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting (N/V), and hypotension, but were unchanged. The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were Metronidazole on 07/16/2128 at 05:44 AM, Ceftazidime on 07/16/2128 at 06:30 AM, and Vancomycin on 07/16/2128 at 12:00 PM. The patient is currently on various ICU medications.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate (HR) of 75 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 71/28 mmHg to 97/"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who is transitioning from hemodialysis (HD) to peritoneal dialysis (PD). She has a recent history of line infection with E. cloacae on ceftazidime, SVC syndrome secondary to clots on systemic anticoagulation, and severe C. diff colitis. The patient's hypotension has markedly improved with fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff: The patient has severe C. diff colitis and is currently being treated with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. It is important to continue this treatment for two weeks beyond the completion of the ceftaz course.
2. Bacteremia: Although the patient's blood cultures are negative, considering her recent hypotension, another week of therapy may be favored.
3. ESRD: The patient's ESRD requires three sessions of PD today with reduced volume today.
4. HTN: Anti-hypertensives are being held.
5. Pain: The patient's pain management plan includes continuing percocet, lidocaine patch, and neurontin.
6. SVC syndrome: The patient is systemically anti-coagulated, and the coumadin dose should be decreased to 1 mg daily.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note."
