   Assessment and Plan
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH): Likely [**3-5**] combination of metabolic
   acidosis [**3-5**] uremia and chachexia causing decreased respirtory muscle
   strength.  Paracentesis yesterday helped SOB somewhat, but pt still
   requiring high flow facemask.
   -          call [**Hospital3 **] to arrange for high flow FM at home
   -          D/C once home hospice is set up
   -          Continue PRN morphine for resp distress
 ASCITES: removed 7.5 liters yesterday.  SAAG=1.3 suggesting element
   of portal hypertension.  Possible that mass from HCC is causing this
   portal hypertension. Diag tap on admission with no evidence of SBP.
   - continue to monitor for ABD tenderness or signs of possible SBP.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER): Pt receives home
   hospice.  Oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 123**].
   - no further treatment at this time
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: likely [**3-5**] uremia.  Causing increased resp drive
   with increased RR.  Pt has refused HD.
   - continue morphine as needed for resp symptoms
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): likely due to
   prerenal etiology.  Renal was consulted and pt is not interested in HD.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Likely [**3-5**] underlying liver disease.  Pt has
   been asymptomatic, and has BP~80s at BL.
   - mange with IVF as needed
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE: Likely the result of hepatic hydrothorax.
   After large volume paracentesis some of the fluid may be resorbed.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS: resolved
 DYSLIPIDEMIA (CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, LIPID DISORDER):
   - continue atorvastatin

","Summary:
- The patient is a cachectic individual with a history of malignant neoplasm of the liver.
- The patient presented to the ICU with dyspnea, which is likely due to a combination of metabolic acidosis, uremia, and cachexia.
- An exudative effusion was removed through paracentesis, and the patient received 45gm albumin post-procedure due to borderline blood pressure.
- The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
- The patient has a history of chronic liver disease, which may be causing portal hypertension and ascites.
- The patient has refused hemodialysis.
- The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, likely secondary to underlying liver disease.
- The patient has an acute pleural effusion, possibly resulting from hepatic hydrothorax.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which has resolved.
- The patient has dyslipidemia, for which atorvastatin is being continued.
- The patient's nutritional status is described as regular diet.
- The patient's glycemic control is not mentioned.
- The patient has multiple lines, including a 20-gauge line inserted on [**2112-2-23**] at 12:00 PM.
- Prophylactic measures include P-Boots for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) code status.
- The patient's physical examination reveals general cachexia, pale conjunctivae, poor dentition, an S3 heart sound, absent peripheral pulses, clear breath sounds with absent bilateral base sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, muscle wasting, warm skin, and oriented neurologic status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dyspnea and decreased respiratory muscle strength increase the risk of respiratory failure, especially since they are still requiring high flow facemask oxygen.
2. Hepatic Hydrothorax: The patient's acute pleural effusion may progress to hepatic hydrothorax, leading to respiratory compromise.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's renal failure could progress to hepatorenal syndrome, further complicating their condition.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to malignancy and liver disease puts them at increased risk for infections.
5. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy, indicated by prolonged PTT and INR, increases the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, causing altered mental status.
7. Liver Cancer Progression: The patient's underlying liver cancer may continue to progress despite palliative care measures."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of malignancy, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent a paracentesis procedure, removing 7.5 liters of fluid from his abdomen. This fluid was determined to be exudative effusion. The patient has borderline blood pressure and is receiving albumin post-procedure. He also has renal issues, as indicated by the use of renal replacement therapy (ALOH) and discontinuation of phosphate control medication. 

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure and oxygen saturation of 93%. His heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal ranges. The patient is on high-flow nasal oxygen for respiratory support. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low albumin, and abnormal electrolyte levels, including magnesium and phosphate. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.31, indicating metabolic acidosis. 

The patient's physical examination is limited due to non-assessment of multiple parameters, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and others. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Dyspnea (shortness of breath): The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of metabolic acidosis, uremia, and cachexia. The recent paracentesis provided some relief, but the patient still requires high-flow facemask oxygen. It is recommended"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-inch individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea, which is likely caused by a combination of metabolic acidosis, uremia, and cachexia. The patient underwent a paracentesis yesterday, removing 7.5 liters of fluid, suggesting ascites. The patient also has a history of hepatic cancer and is receiving home hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dyspnea and decreased respiratory muscle strength due to metabolic acidosis, uremia, and cachexia may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Hepatic Hydrothorax: The presence of an acute pleural effusion indicates the possibility of hepatic hydrothorax, which can cause respiratory distress.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's renal failure could potentially progress to hepatorenal syndrome, especially considering their underlying liver disease.
4. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): Although the diagnostic tap on admission did not show evidence of SBP, monitoring for abdominal tenderness or signs of SBP is crucial due to the presence of ascites.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate underlying liver disease or hypovolemia, which could worsen if fluid balance is not maintained properly.
6. Malnutrition: Given the patient's cachexia, there is a risk of malnutrition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-inch individual with a chief complaint of respiratory distress, ascites, and renal failure. The patient had a large volume paracentesis yesterday, which may have improved their breathing, but they remain vague about this. Their greatest fear is dyspnea. They experienced an episode of hypotension and received a normal saline bolus with a good response. The patient is currently anuric (not producing urine) and has been placed on hospice care at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an ABG result of 7.31/37/86/21/-6, indicating acidosis. This can lead to further respiratory distress and compromise oxygenation.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is anuric with rising creatinine levels, suggesting acute renal failure. This can result in electrolyte imbalances and fluid accumulation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can cause inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient may have an acute pleural effusion due to their respiratory symptoms and history of fluid accumulation.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammation.
6. Dyslipidemia: The patient has abnormal lipid levels, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications.

   Assessment and Plan
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH): Pt has persistent SOB despite
   paracentesis.  Liekly that metabolic acidosis from uremia is increasing
   his respiratory drive and with his cachexia and muscle wasting his
   diaphram and resp muscles are unable to meet the increased demand to
   blow off CO2 causing increased Dyspnea.
   - Continue O2 by high flow mask while here
   - Spoke to Caritas Home Hospice yesterday, and high flow mask should be
   available today
   - morphine and ativan PRN for comfort
   - nebs prn for dyspnea
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): acute on chronic
   renal failure.  Pt has refused dialysis.  Likely that uremia is
   uderlying some of his dyspnea as described above.
   - continue to manage dyspnea with supplemental O2 and Morphine/ativan
   for comfort
   - continue ALOH
   - d/c with Rx for nephrocaps
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), HEPATIC (LIVER): Pt has HCC.  Oncologist
   is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 123**].  Pt is currently Home with Hospice and pursuing no further
   treatment.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: Likely [**3-5**] uremia as described above, and is
   driving increased resp drive.
   -manage dyspnea as above
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): pt has basline hypotension, from which he is
   asymtomatic.
   -fluid bolus for symtoms
 ASCITES: s/p 7.5 L paracentesis on [**2-23**].  Abd exam today is distended
   with some residual ascites, but not tense and not requiring para at

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on home hospice presenting with dyspnea and ascites. The patient's symptoms partially improved after paracentesis but worsened over the last 24 hours. 

The patient has a background of fatigue, weight loss, dry mouth, tachypnea, and dyspnea. Vital signs show low blood pressure, normal heart rate, and respiratory rate within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is 95%. The patient is cachectic with sunken orbits, poor dentition, and muscle wasting. Physical examination also reveals crackles at the left lung base, soft and non-tender abdomen with distention, and absent peripheral pulses. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine and potassium levels, low albumin, elevated liver enzymes, and low magnesium. The patient's blood glucose level is normal, but other lab values show abnormalities. 

Assessment and plan include dyspnea, likely due to metabolic acidosis from uremia and increased respiratory drive. The patient continues to receive supplemental oxygen and morphine/ativan for comfort. Renal failure is also noted, with acute-on-chronic renal failure, and the patient has refused dialysis. The patient has a history of HCC and is under home hospice care without further treatment. 

Additional assessments include metabolic acidosis, likely related to uremia, hypotension, ascites,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on home hospice. He presented with dyspnea and ascites, and after paracentesis, his symptoms partially improved. However, his condition worsened over the last 24 hours. The patient is experiencing increasing discomfort and dyspnea but has shown mild improvement with nebs and high flow mask. He was administered morphine and ativan IV, providing significant relief and allowing him to sleep. The patient's allergies, last dose of antibiotics, and infusion information are not provided. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 75/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has sinus rhythm and shows signs of cachexia, poor dentition, and muscle wasting. Physical examination reveals crackles at the left base of the chest and a soft, non-tender abdomen with distention. Neurological assessment is unable to be performed due to the patient's dyspnea and fatigue.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 8.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, glucose of 117 mg/dL, creatinine of 5.6 mg/dL, and potassium levels of 5.6 mEq/L and 21 mEq/L. Other labs indicate elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with dyspnea, likely caused by metabolic acidosis from uremia and increased respiratory drive. His cachexia and muscle wasting contribute to his respiratory distress. The patient is also diagnosed with acute renal failure, which is likely due to chronic renal failure. The patient has refused dialysis. Additionally, the patient has hepatic cancer (HCC) and is receiving home hospice care. He is also experiencing metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to uremia. The patient has baseline hypotension but is asymptomatic. He has ascites, which was partially relieved with paracentesis. The patient is also diagnosed with dyslipidemia and an acute pleural effusion, which is likely due to hepatic hydrothorax.

The plan includes continuing supplemental oxygen via high flow mask, administering morphine and ativan as needed for comfort, using nebs as needed for dyspnea, and arranging for a high flow face mask upon discharge. The patient will continue with ALOH (albumin infusion) and nephrocaps (unknown medication). The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will be discharged home with hospice."
