","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male who was admitted with urosepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He has been intubated and sedated, and is currently receiving fluids, antibiotics (Zosyn), and antihypertensive medication (Diltiazem). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/52 mmHg to 109/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory system compliance of 61.1 mL/cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and unknown left ventricular ejection fraction. He also has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to impending respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Urosepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and a likely urine source. It is important"

","The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and respiratory failure. He was intubated for impending respiratory failure and is currently on minimal sedation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 87/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and unknown left ventricular ejection fraction. He also has a B-type natriuretic peptide level greater than 1804, indicating increased preload and decreased cardiac output. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and he has been receiving Diltiazem boluses but will be changed to metoprolol as needed.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (366 K/uL), elevated glucose level (159 mg/dL), and elevated lactate level (3.1 mmol/L). His kidney function tests indicate an increased BUN:Cr ratio suggestive of pre-renal etiology.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, trace peripheral edema, soft and distended abdomen with bowel sounds present, and resonant percussion in the chest. The neurologic examination was not assessed due to sedation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), coronary artery disease (CAD), and an unknown ejection fraction (EF). He is currently intubated for respiratory failure and is being treated with antibiotics (Zosyn), amiodarone, metoprolol, fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/50-113/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and pseudoobstruction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to impending respiratory failure. The plan is to attempt spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) later today or tomorrow and consider extubation tomorrow or the next day. However, there is concern for possible pneumothorax (ptx), so a lateral decubitus position will be monitored to detect any signs of ptx.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR has not responded to amiodarone loading. Continuous"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of urosepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, requiring intubation for impending respiratory failure. They are currently on assisted controlled ventilation (AC) mode with minimal sedation.

The patient has a known history of coronary artery disease (CAD), although the clarity of the history is unclear. The patient experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of afib with RVR, likely secondary to demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and hypovolemia. The beta-blockers (BB) are being held as the patient is currently on calcium channel blockers (CCB). It does not appear to be an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and medical management is being pursued at this point. Aspirin (ASA) is also being held due to pseudoobstruction.

The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is unknown, but the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated, indicating increased preload and decreased cardiac output (CO) due to the irregular rhythm. This is not suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF), and the clinical exam does not support CHF either. The patient is likely hypovolemic, so aggressive hydration is being initiated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male admitted to the ICU with urosepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He has a history of ischemic colonic stricture and was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR, likely secondary to demand ischemia. The patient has been treated with multiple medications including amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, metoprolol for blood pressure control, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for sepsis. He is currently intubated for impending respiratory failure and has failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) on [10-29]. There are concerns about possible pneumothorax (ptx), and the plan is to re-attempt SBT later today or tomorrow with the possibility of extubation tomorrow or the next day. The patient has a history of pseudoobstruction and has been placed on intermittent nasogastric tube (NGT) suction and serial repositioning in bed. His code status is full code, and he has been consulted with pain and palliative care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current intubation and failure of SBT indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and re-evaluation are necessary to determine the appropriate timing for ext"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of Proteus urosepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He is currently being treated with antibiotics and metoprolol.

2. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and is intubated. He has a high Respiratory System Compliance Index (RSBI), indicating potential respiratory distress. Light sedation is being used, and efforts are being made to correct metabolic acidosis prior to extubation.

3. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), although the details are unclear. He had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR, likely secondary to demand ischemia caused by tachycardia and hypovolemia. He was previously on diltiazem at the outside hospital, and will continue with beta-blocker therapy both intravenously and orally.

4. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is unknown, but B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, indicating increased preload and decreased cardiac output due to the irregular rhythm. This is not suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF), and the clinical examination does not support this diagnosis either. The patient is net fluid positive.

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old retired surgeon with a history of atrial fibrillation, progressive dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the emergency room from a nursing home with worsening respiratory distress, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to the UTI, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute renal failure, and colonic ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presumed secondary sepsis due to the UTI can lead to complications such as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring mechanical ventilation and increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: This cardiac arrhythmia can lead to hemodynamic instability, stroke, or thromboembolic events if not properly managed.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen, leading to chronic renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
5. Colonic Ileus: The colonic ileus can progress to bowel"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, progressive dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease. He presented to the emergency room with worsening respiratory distress and was intubated due to sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection caused by Proteus bacteria. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, metoprolol for rate control, and other medications. He has acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and colonic ileus. The plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy, weaning off sedation, assessing the ability to protect the airway before extubation, and considering gastrointestinal motility measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid production and decreased mucosal protection.
4. Renal insufficiency: Acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal insufficiency if not appropriately managed.
5. Colonic ileus: If the colonic ileus persists, it may lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, progressive dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the emergency room from a nursing home with worsening respiratory distress, a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute. A urinalysis showed a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient was diagnosed with sepsis secondary to a UTI caused by Proteus bacteria. He also has respiratory failure, likely due to metabolic acidosis. His troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury. The patient's creatinine level is decreasing with fluid resuscitation, suggesting acute renal failure that is likely pre-renal in nature. His blood glucose levels are high.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient will receive appropriate antibiotics based on the sensitivity of the Proteus bacteria. Intravenous fluids (LR) will be given as needed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient will be weaned off the ventilator if hemodynamics remain stable. If successful, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted for extubation.
3. Troponin elevation: Enzymes will be followed, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be monitored.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): Intravenous"

2. Respiratory failure: Secondary to sepsis, with metabolic acidosis worsening ventilator demands.
3. Acute renal failure: Suspected prerenal in nature, with creatinine trending downward with fluid resuscitation.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): Being managed with IV metoprolol for rate control.
5. Colonic ileus: Suspected due to decreased bowel sounds and distension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Stress ulcer: Due to increased gastric acid production and decreased mucosal protection in critically ill patients.
4. Nosocomial infections: Due to invasive lines and catheters.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for these potential complications and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage them."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, progressive dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the emergency room with worsening respiratory distress at a nursing home and was brought in by EMS. The patient had a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, and urine analysis indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). He was diagnosed with sepsis presumed to be secondary to the UTI, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and colonic ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection. It is important to continue aggressive management with broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if not adequately supported with mechanical ventilation and weaning off the ventilator as per hemodynamic stability.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, which could be due to prerenal causes. Close monitoring of renal function and continuing fluid resuscitation are necessary.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs rate control medication and possibly amiodarone. Monitoring of"

   Assessment and Plan
   89M with Proteus urosepsis on Zosyn and atrial fibrillation with RVR on
   Metoprolol
   Urosepsis: Septic physiology with tachycardia, tachypneia and
   leuckocytosis, with likely urine source
   - Prelim Culture showing Proteus.  Currently on Zosyn and will tailor
   when sensitivities return
   - surveillance blood cultures - NGTD
   Respiratory Failure: intubated for impending respiratory failure.  High
   RSBI this am.  Patient currently on light sedation.  Tachypnea thought
   to be due to underlying metabolic acidosis.  Will attempt to correct
   acidosis with bicarb prior to extubation.  -f/u lateral decub.
   CV:
   CAD: Patient with known CAD, although unclear history.  NSTEMI in
   setting of afib with RVR likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting
   of tachycardia and hypovolemia. Previously on dilt at OSH, will
   continue with BB.  IV until patient taking PO
   PUMP: Unknown EF.  BNP > [**Numeric Identifier 1804**].  [**Month (only) 8**] be increased from increased
   preload and decreased CO given irregular rhythm.  This is not
   suggestive of CHF and clinical exam is not suggestive of CHF.  Patient
   net fluid positive.
   RHYTHM: afib with RVR, currently loaded with amiodorone without
   significant effect.  Will continue to bolus with metoprolol IV until
   patient can take PO
   #Pseudoobstruction: unclear precipitant.  Per outside records, patient
   has history of this in the past, treated conservatively.
   - Will keep patient on intermittent OGT suction
   - Serial repositioning in bed
   - rectal exam to rule out low obstruction
   #Code: full. Follow-up with pain and palliative care recs. Discuss with
   daughter before extubating, and options of re-intubating.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of proteus urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and unknown CAD. He was intubated for impending respiratory failure and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has shown improvement in transverse colon dilatation and has been weaned off sedation. His urine electrolytes are consistent with possible Type I RTA, and he has been started on sodium bicarb 650 tid. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 85/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and blood glucose levels. His cardiac markers and liver function tests are within normal range. The patient's assessment and plan include urosepsis, respiratory failure, cardiovascular issues, and possible pseudo-obstruction. The patient's code status is full, and his disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to impending respiratory failure. There is a potential complication of extubation failure, which may require re-intubation.
2. Urosepsis: The patient has a history of proteus urosepsis, and there is a potential complication of worsening infection leading to septic shock"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, progressive dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the emergency room with worsening respiratory distress and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Proteus. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Sepsis: Presumed secondary to the UTI with Proteus.
2. Respiratory failure: Secondary to sepsis and metabolic acidosis from type I renal tubular acidosis (RTA) with increased ventilator demands. The patient was previously intubated but has been extubated and is doing well.
3. Acute renal failure: Suspected prerenal in nature, with creatinine trending downward with fluid resuscitation. Non-gap acidosis and electrolyte imbalances consistent with Type I RTA.
4. Colonic ileus: Improved dilation of the transverse colon, but no bowel movement has occurred. The patient will be checked for rectal exam and started on a bowel regimen including senna and bisacodyl per rectum. Reglan may be considered if the QTc interval is within normal limits.

Overall, the patient is receiving appropriate care in the ICU, including nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and monitoring for"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, progressive dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the emergency room with worsening respiratory distress and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation, with a recent episode of ventilator weaning failure. He has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and potential colonic ileus. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, troponin T levels, lactate levels, and kidney function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can lead to respiratory infection and potentially worsen respiratory function.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and further deterioration could result in AKI, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Colonic ileus: The presence of mild distension and hypoactive bowel sounds raises concern for colonic ileus, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Worsening sepsis: Despite initial improvement, there is still a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis, potentially leading to multiorgan dysfunction.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of additional cardiac arrhythmias, which could impact cardiovascular stability.
7. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to skin breakdown and potential infection.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed to optimize the patient's outcome."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, progressive dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the emergency room with worsening respiratory distress and was diagnosed with sepsis presumed to be secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Proteus. The patient also has respiratory failure, likely due to sepsis and metabolic acidosis from type I renal tubular acidosis (RTA). He was successfully extubated and is currently doing well.

The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFL with RVR), acute renal failure, and colonic ileus. The acute renal failure is suspected to be prerenal in nature and is trending downward with fluid resuscitation. His electrolytes are consistent with type I RTA, so he is being continued on sodium bicarbonate for now.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving appropriate nutrition and glycemic control. His lines include a 22-gauge line inserted on 10/28/2156 at 03:32 AM. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with Coumadin on hold, stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full, and his disposition is to remain in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 89-year-old male with a history of Proteus urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and unknown CAD. He was previously intubated for impending respiratory failure but has now been extubated. The patient is currently taking PO medications and has a run of VT. He has allergies to shellfish-derived products and peanuts. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.6°C, HR: 90 bpm, BP: 105/70 mmHg, RR: 27 insp/min, SpO2: 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had a history of impending respiratory failure requiring intubation. Although he has been extubated, he still exhibits tachypnea secondary to metabolic acidosis. There is a potential for respiratory failure to recur if the metabolic acidosis is not corrected adequately.

2. Urosepsis: The patient has a confirmed infection with Proteus mirabilis, which can cause urosepsis. He is currently on Zosyn but will have his antibiotic regimen tailored based on the sensitivity results. If the infection spreads or if there is resistance to the current antibiotics, there is a potential for worsening sepsis.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of Proteus urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU and received invasive ventilation. The patient underwent extubation and had a peripherally inserted intravenous catheter placed. He was switched from Zosyn to ceftriaxone, which is sensitive to the growing Proteus. The patient is now taking oral medications and is more interactive, opening his eyes and following simple commands. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 105/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He has a history of cardiac arrhythmia, abdominal pseudoobstruction, and type I renal tubular acidosis. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and elevated glucose levels. The patient's urine culture shows sensitivity to ceftriaxone. The patient's code status is full, and he is being followed up with pain and palliative care recommendations. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had a previous episode of respiratory failure requiring intubation. Although he has been extubated and is doing well on room air, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Urosepsis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old male with a chief complaint of low urine output and relative hypotension. The patient has a history of Proteus urosepsis, atrial fibrillation, and is currently on metoprolol. He was admitted to the ICU due to septic physiology with tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis, likely from a urinary source. The patient was also intubated on admission for impending respiratory failure but was extubated on October 31st. He is currently on room air and has resolved his tachypnea secondary to metabolic acidosis. The patient has a history of CAD, atrial fibrillation, Type I RTA, and pseudoobstruction. He is currently receiving treatment for urosepsis with ceftriaxone, rate control for atrial fibrillation with lopressor, and bicarbonate solution for Type I RTA. The patient's pseudoobstruction has improved with conservative management. The patient's code status is full, and he will be followed up with pain and palliative care recommendations. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient's condition suggests that he may be experiencing urosepsis, which is a severe infection caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream through the urinary tract. This can lead to systemic inflammation and organ failure if not promptly treated.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history"

","The patient is an 89-year-old retired surgeon with a history of atrial fibrillation, progressive dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with worsening respiratory distress at a nursing home and was brought to the emergency room (ER) by EMS. The patient's initial vital signs upon arrival were heart rate (HR) 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate (RR) 50 breaths per minute, and urine analysis (U/A) indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI) with the presence of Proteus. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient is currently being treated for several conditions, including sepsis presumed secondary to the UTI, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), acute renal failure, non-gap acidosis consistent with type I renal tubular acidosis (RTA), colonic ileus, and malnutrition.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate (HR) 91 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) 100/51 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 100%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.5-7.3 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.8-33.6%, platelet (Plt) count of 72-380 thousand/mm³, creatinine (Cr) level of 1."
