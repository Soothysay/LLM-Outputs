   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 year old man with astrocytoma and recent long hospital
   stays who comes to the MICU floor from the neuro floor with atrial
   fibrillation and hypotension; and stays for poor pulmonary toilet in
   the setting of copious secretions.
   LEUKOCYTOSIS
   Acute increase in secretions coupled with apparent encephalopathy,
   fever, and elevated white count is all consistent with HAP. He does
   have abdominal pain today worse than yesterday and an abdominal process
   is still possible, though a specific etiology has not presented itself.
   Pneumoperitoneum [**2-25**] PEG site manipulation, has not appeared to be an
   infectious process.
   - continue cefepime vanco
   - follow cxr
   - f/u cxs incl urine blood sputum; stool for c. diff
   - avoid flagyl given past experience of likely association with lowered
   sz threshold and szs
   NEW ONSET ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Comes in setting of new tachypnea and secretions and recent increase in
   WBC. Most likely c/w infectious process. LENI negative for DVT; at this
   point low suspicion for PE and does not need further workup for this.
   No past report of structural problems with heart or other pulmonary
   disease.
   - echocardiogram being done this AM
   - thyroid labs unremarkable
   - follow up sputum cultures
   - treating for possible PNA as above
   - diltiazem (has responded to this in the past evidently), give IV on
   top of PO regimen, attempt to bridge to all PO control if dilt gives
   good control
   - anticoagulation should likely be avoided given dangers of bleeding
   into brainstem lesion
   HYPOTENSION/HYPERTENSION
   Normotensive currently. Has been hypertensive and on amlodipine,
   lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. D/c'ing ACEi and HCTZ given renal
   failure. Continuing diltiazem should control BP as well as providing
   rate control.
   - echo as above
   - diltiazem for rate control
   - d/c amlodipine and substitute hydralazine for shorter-acting BP
   control in ICU pt if hypertension returns, this is not an issue
   currently
   RENAL FAILURE
   Thought to be associated with brief period of acyclovir earlier in
   hospitalization, but no longer on acyclovir and renal function is
   worsening. BUN/Cr ratio not c/w pre-renal causes.
   - urine lytes
still pending
   - good urine output currently; c/w ATN- if drops off could consider
   renal u/s to r/o hydronephrosis but this is unlikely currently
   - holding HCTZ and lisinopril
   TACHYPNEA
   Apparently has only started being tachypneic relatively recently.
   Likely the result of increasing secretions given extremely rhonchorous
   exam. Bronchitis is a possibility; however as above, currently treating
   for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   - RNs are suctioning secretions, requiring frequent suctioning
   - incentive spirometry, chest PT as tolerated
   - can consider glycopyrrolate or similar to reduce secretions but
   holding off on this for now given some assoc with arrhythmias
   - f/u CXRs
   MENTAL STATUS
   Less somnolent today than yesterday. Appears more oriented and
   certainly is more interactive. Improvement confirms idea that mental
   status waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], perhaps assoc w infection.
   - follow closely.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with astrocytoma who was transferred to the MICU for hypotension, increasing secretions, and poor pulmonary toilet. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and recent long hospital stays. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 77 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 112/46 mmHg to 150/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and other abnormalities in kidney function tests.

The assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and measures are being taken to control it. Diltiazem is being given for rate control and to manage blood pressure.

2. Acute increase in secretions coupled with apparent encephalopathy, fever, and elevated white count is consistent with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotics, and further cultures are being obtained.

3. New-onset atrial fibrillation is suspected to be related to an infectious process. An echoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 year old man with astrocytoma and recent long hospital
   stays who comes to the MICU floor from the neuro floor with atrial
   fibrillation and hypotension; and stays for poor pulmonary toilet in
   the setting of copious secretions.
    MENTAL STATUS: paranoid O/N received haldol. This also occurred when
   he was initially admitted to neuro service. Concerned this represents
   delirium in setting of infection or sundowning due ot dementia given
   underlying brain dysfunction from astrocytoma. Need to also consider
   may be scopolamine patch.
   - haldol prn
   - MRI brain when able
   - consult with neurooncology
   - follow closely.
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: resolved on antibiotics. will treat empirically for
   bronchitis vs pneumonia on cefepime/ vancomycin. Abdominal pain in
   setting of pneumoperitoneum [**2-25**] PEG site manipulation, has not appeared
   to be an infectious process.
   - continue cefepime vanco
   - follow cxr
   - f/u cxs incl urine blood sputum; stool for c. diff
   - avoid flagyl given past experience of likely association ? lowered sz
   threshold and szs
   NEW ONSET ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: patient went into atrial fibrillation
   O/N [**1-14**]. Maps remained > 60. Patient was very agitated at the time.
   Patient was treated for mental status changes as above. Most likely c/w
   infectious process. LENI negative for DVT; at this point low suspicion
   for PE and does not need further workup for this. No past report of
   structural problems with heart or other pulmonary disease. thyroid labs
   unremarkable. ECHO with diastolic dysfunction and preserved EF. Left
   and right atrium > 6.5 cm.
   - follow up sputum cultures
   - treating for possible PNA as above
   - increase diltiazem this am to help with rate control
   - anticoagulation should likely be avoided given dangers of bleeding
   into brainstem lesion
   HYPOTENSION/HYPERTENSION
   Normotensive currently. Has been hypertensive and on amlodipine,
   lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. D/c'ing ACEi and HCTZ given renal
   failure. Continuing diltiazem should control BP as well as providing
   rate control.
   - diltiazem for rate control
   - d/c amlodipine and substitute hydralazine for shorter-acting BP
   control in ICU pt if hypertension returns, this is not an issue
   currently
   RENAL FAILURE: lytes suggest may be intrinsic. negative eos, stable
   urine function. Patient off acyclovir
   - good urine output currently; c/w ATN- if drops off could consider
   renal u/s to r/o hydronephrosis but this is unlikely currently
   - holding HCTZ and lisinopril
   TACHYPNEA: due to secretions. on scopolamine patch.
   - RNs are suctioning secretions, requiring frequent suctioning
   - incentive spirometry, chest PT as tolerated
   - f/u CXRs
   ASTROCYTOMA; benign, consequence due to fact that it is space occupying
   - discussion with family and neuro onc quality vs quantity of life

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of astrocytoma and recent long hospital stays. He was admitted to the MICU floor from the neuro floor due to atrial fibrillation and hypotension. The main concerns include poor pulmonary toilet, copious secretions, and altered mental status. The patient received haloperidol for paranoia and has a history of similar episodes. There are ongoing issues with leukocytosis, new-onset atrial fibrillation, hypertension, renal failure, tachypnea, and astrocytoma. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and diltiazem for rate control. Renal function is stable, and the patient is on tube feeds. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and paranoia could indicate delirium, which may be caused by infection or underlying brain dysfunction from the astrocytoma.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of poor pulmonary toilet and copious secretions, along with leukocytosis, suggest a possible infection such as pneumonia. The patient is already receiving antibiotics empirically.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, which may be related to an infectious process. Rate control is being achieved with diltiazem, but ant"

   CXR: improvement of pneumoperitoneum, no acute cardiopulmonary process
   Cultures: stool, urine, blood no growth to date. Sputum all
   insufficient due to patient lack of gag.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 year old man with astrocytoma and recent long hospital
   stays who comes to the MICU floor from the neuro floor with atrial
   fibrillation and hypotension; and stays for poor pulmonary toilet in
   the setting of copious secretions.
    MENTAL STATUS: paranoid O/N received haldol. This also occurred when
   he was initially admitted to neuro service. Concerned this represents
   delirium in setting of infection or sundowning due underlying brain
   dysfunction from astrocytoma. Need to also consider may be scopolamine
   patch, do not think cause as patient has done before.
   - zydis prn
   - MRI non contrast brain when able
 but will defer to neurooncology
   - consult with neuro-oncology, PCP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 980**]
   - follow closely.
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: resolved on antibiotics. Will treat empirically for
   bronchitis vs pneumonia on cefepime/ vancomycin. Abdominal pain in
   setting of pneumoperitoneum [**2-25**] PEG site manipulation, has not appeared
   to be an infectious process.
   - continue cefepime /vanco for 8 day course
   - follow cxr
   - f/u cxs incl urine blood sputum; stool for c. diff
   - avoid flagyl given past experience of likely association ? lowered sz
   threshold and szs
   NEW ONSET ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: patient went into atrial fibrillation
   O/N [**1-14**]. Maps remained > 60. Patient was very agitated at the time.
   Patient was treated for mental status changes as above. Most likely c/w
   infectious process. LENI negative for DVT; at this point low suspicion
   for PE and does not need further workup for this. No past report of
   structural problems with heart or other pulmonary disease. thyroid labs
   unremarkable. ECHO with diastolic dysfunction and preserved EF. Left
   and right atrium > 6.5 cm.
   - treating for possible PNA as above
   - continue diltiazem this am to help with rate control
   - anticoagulation should likely be avoided given dangers of bleeding
   into brainstem lesion
   HYPOTENSION/HYPERTENSION
   Normotensive currently. Has been hypertensive and on amlodipine,
   lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. D/c'ing ACEi and HCTZ given renal
   failure. Continuing diltiazem should control BP as well as providing
   rate control.
   - diltiazem for rate control
   - amlodipine
   RENAL FAILURE: lytes suggest may be intrinsic. negative eos, stable
   urine function. Patient off acyclovir.
   - good urine output currently; c/w ATN
   - trend Cr, monitor UOP
   - holding HCTZ and lisinopril
   TACHYPNEA: due to secretions. on scopolamine patch.
   - RNs are suctioning secretions, q2-4hours
   - incentive spirometry, chest PT as tolerated
   - f/u CXRs
   ASTROCYTOMA; benign, consequence due to fact that it is space occupying
   - plan discussion with family and neuro onc quality vs quantity of life

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of astrocytoma, recent long hospital stays, and current admission to the MICU floor from the neuro floor. He has atrial fibrillation and hypotension, with poor pulmonary toilet due to copious secretions. The patient's mental status has been altered overnight, with paranoia, and he received haloperidol (Haldol). He also experienced similar symptoms when initially admitted to the neuro service. There is concern about delirium in the setting of infection or sundowning due to underlying brain dysfunction from astrocytoma. The patient has leukocytosis, which has resolved with antibiotics. He is being treated empirically for bronchitis vs pneumonia on cefepime/vancomycin. The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, treated with diltiazem for rate control. He is normotensive, but has a history of hypertension and is on amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient's renal function is stable, and he is being monitored for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He has tachypnea due to secretions, and measures are being taken to suction and manage his respiratory status. The patient's astrocytoma is benign, and the focus is on quality of life versus quantity of life discussions with the family and neuro-oncology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status, with paranoia, may indicate delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medication side effects, or underlying brain dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which has resolved with antibiotics, indicating a possible initial infection. He is being treated empirically for bronchitis vs pneumonia, suggesting concern for a respiratory infection.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed for rate control and rhythm control.
4. Renal Failure: There is concern for intrinsic renal failure, indicated by electrolyte imbalances and stable urine output. Monitoring for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is important.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's tachypnea is due to secretions, and measures are being taken to manage his respiratory status. This may include suctioning, incentive spirometry, and chest physiotherapy.
6. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient has had episodes of hypotension and hypertension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate medication adjustments are necessary.
7. Quality of Life vs Quantity of Life: The patient's astrocytoma is benign, and discussions regarding quality of life versus quantity of life are ongoing with the family and neuro-oncology. This reflects the ethical considerations and decisions surrounding end-of-life care."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 year old man with progressive astrocytoma admitted for afib with
   RVR, now with respiratory insuffcieny [**2-25**] poor pulmonary toilet.
   1.       Resp Distress: Primary issue is persistent aspiration and
   inability to protect his airway with frequent desaturations and need
   for NT suctioning . No imaging evidence of lower respiratory infection
   but has mild leukocytosis and low grade temps, we are treating
   empirically with vanc/cefpime and cultures pending.
   2.       Non-oliguric ARF with no acute indication for hemodialysis.
   Urine lytes , renal ultrasound pending. Renally dose meds and avoid
   nephrotoxins.
   3.       Afib: On Diltiazem for afib, TTE pending, TSH wnl, cardiac
   markers negative.
   4.       Agitation: per old notes frequent nocturnal agitation on floor
 responded to Haldl, start nocturnal seroqeul. Avoiding benzos.
   Scopalamine was a new med for him so if recurs will need to d/c.
   5.       Astrocytoma: per NeuroOnc benign pathology so prognosis is
   limited mainly by his present neuron deficit and their impairment on
   his quality of life.
   Further plans as per resident note.

   50 year old man with chronic aspiration [**2-25**] astrocytoma, afib now in
   the MICU with need for frequent pulmonary toilet. Suctioned only two
   times this am so likely  ready for the floor. Agitation overnight
   appears to be delerium [**2-25**] ICU stay and baseline poor mental status.
   Started on scolpolamine patch yesterday but has tolerated this in the
   past. Responded to haldol will start standing seroquel today. Complete
   8 day course of empiric abcx for respiratory infection. Okay to
   transfer to the floor today. Further plans as per resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of astrocytoma, currently in the MICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and poor pulmonary toilet. He has been experiencing agitation overnight, requiring restraints, and his urine electrolytes indicate intrinsic renal injury. The patient has allergies to penicillins and is currently on various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's cardiac rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's poor pulmonary toilet and rhonchorous breath sounds suggest a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Renal Complications: The presence of intrinsic renal injury indicated by urine electrolytes suggests a risk of worsening renal function, leading to acute kidney injury.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may increase the risk of arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Delirium: The patient's agitation and response to haloperidol suggest the possibility of delirium, which can complicate the hospital course and increase the risk of falls"
