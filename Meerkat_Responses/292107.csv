   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with history of arthritis and now admitted with knee pain
   on [**7-5**].  Hospitalization notable for increased abdominal distention
   and in the setting of concern for SBO based upon KUB imaging patient to
   the OR for EXP LAP.  There she did have high grade obstruction seen and
   subsequently had resection and re-anstamosis completed.  She did have
   abdominal wound left open for possible re-exploration.
   1)SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)-Thought to be secondary to adhesions from
   previous surgery and based upon findings may have been evolving prior
   to admission.  Of note her WBC has remained at 11-13 with bandemia
   noted.
   -Minimal drainage from NGT noted since 3am
   -Cefazolin/Falgyl/Vanco
   -Continue NGT to suction
   -Will move to OR today per surgery given concerning findings on
   previous exploration
   2)HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)--She has had persistent elevation in HR,
   decrease in MAP and with CVP decreased it has now been re-established
   to 12 following IVF given with CVP=6 at start.  Patient with issue
   related to integrity of A-line tracing and have moved to NIV cuff
   measurement.
   -Will need to re-site A-line for BP monitoring
   -Will continue broad spectrum ABX with Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]/Flagyl/cefazolin
   thorugh the night
will re-discuss with surgery based upon findings
   overnight
   -Avoid pressors at all costs
   3)Arthritis-Unclear source and joint has not been sampled.  Has
   undergone empiric increase in steroid dosing with Solumdrol IV trialed.
   -Solumedrol 40mg IV q 8 hours
   4)Respiratory Failure-Patient with intubation continued in the setting
   of likely need to return to OR today and has had continued good
   tolerance of ventilatory support.
   -Will continue with A/C support
   -Mechanics with resistance=6 and Compliance=30 and preserved PaO2
   acceptable.
   -Continue and consider PEEP increase if worsening hypoxia and edema.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of arthritis. She was admitted with knee pain and later developed increased abdominal distention. Imaging revealed a small bowel obstruction, which was confirmed during exploratory laparotomy. The patient underwent resection and anastomosis, with her abdominal wound left open for possible re-exploration. She has been experiencing minimal drainage from the nasogastric tube and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction may lead to complications such as intestinal ischemia, perforation, or necrosis if not managed promptly.
2) Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could indicate inadequate tissue perfusion, potentially leading to organ damage or failure.
3) Arthritis: The unclear source of arthritis may worsen over time, causing pain and decreased mobility for the patient.
4) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could deteriorate if ventilation support is not maintained, resulting in further hypoxia and potential lung damage.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment."

   bowel resection with abdomen left open, now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for
   management.
   .
   #  High Grade SBO: s/p ex lap with partial small bowel resection,
   abdomen left open for re-look in the morning.
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - will keep pt sedated to avoid risk of evisceration
   - cont flagyl and cefazolin for prophylaxis while abdomen remains open
   - aggressive IVF resuscitation to avoid pressors if able
   - monitor UOP to assess fluid status and bolus prn for <30cc/h
   - plan to go to the OR tomorrow for a second look
   .
   #  Respiratory:  Pt is intubated post-op with abdomen left open.
   Currently tolerating mechanical ventilation well.
   - continue assist control ventilation at current settings
   - check ABG in the AM
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation (propofol was felt to be causing
   hypotension)
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: Initially thought [**1-24**] pain/nausea related SIADH. Her
   home lasix has been held while in house. However, given [**Month (only) **] PO intake
   and Urine studies with Na<10 (and Hgb concentrated), more consistent
   with volume depletion.
   - aggressive IVF for now as above
   - cont to monitor
   -Was 131 on admission, lasix stopped, no IVFs given-->then dropped 128
   [**7-6**]-->500cc IVFs-->dropped 127 [**7-7**]-->1.5L IVFs-->128 on [**7-8**]
   -continue aggressive IVFs 100cc/hr given npo, NGT outpt. monitor uop.
   -If Na remains low, needs renal consult.
   -cont to hold Lasix
   .
   #  Acute atraumatic L knee pain/LE spasms: No history of trauma. On
   exam, no inflamm changes (effusion/erythema). Xray no fx and no
   effusion. Unclear etiology. No h/o gout/psuedogout but is at risk, esp
   given elevated ESR/CRP, though would have expected some inflamm
   changes. Not typical for sciatica. No DVT on LENIs.  Difficult to
   assess now that patient is intubated and sedated.
   -cont tylenol 1000mg TID. prednisone converted to solumedrol as above.
   Stopped salsalate given dyspepsia/nausea/vomiting
   -anti-emetics
   -if worsening, consider rheum consult for further eval
   .
   #  Leukopenia, neutrophilia: WBC dropped from 13.6 to 2.8 post-op. UA
   neg on admission, repeat with wbc but no bacteria, urine culture
   contaminated. CXR nothing acute. Likely related to high-grade SBO.  She
   is afebrile.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of high-grade small bowel obstruction (SBO) who underwent a partial small bowel resection and had her abdomen left open. She is currently in the ICU for management.

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, tolerating it well. She is sedated with midazolam (versed) and fentanyl to avoid the risk of evisceration. Antibiotics have been started for prophylaxis, and aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is being performed to maintain adequate blood pressure and prevent the need for vasopressors. Urine output is being monitored to assess fluid status and boluses are given as needed for output <30cc/hour.

The patient's sodium levels have been low, initially thought to be related to SIADH due to pain and nausea. However, given the patient's low oral intake and urine studies showing a concentrated urine with low sodium levels, volume depletion is more likely. Aggressive intravenous fluids are being continued, and the patient's sodium levels are being closely monitored. Lasix has been held.

The patient also has acute atraumatic left knee pain and leg spasms, with no history of trauma. X-ray results show no fractures or effusion, and the cause of the pain is unclear. The patient is at risk for gout or pseudogout, but there are no signs of inflammation. Tylenol is being given for pain"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female admitted to the ICU due to a small bowel obstruction. She has a history of multiple medical conditions and allergies to various medications. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume of 0 and spontaneous tidal volume ranging from 361-420 mL. Her blood pressure is 113/57 mmHg, heart rate is 85 bpm, respiratory rate is 18 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. The patient's kidney function appears to be normal, with creatinine levels within the normal range. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's current condition of small bowel obstruction poses a potential complication that may require surgical intervention if conservative management fails.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure reading of 113/57 mmHg indicates hypotension, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP, a common complication in critically ill patients.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing blood"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old female who underwent partial small bowel resection due to small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has been admitted to the ICU post-operation with her abdomen left open.

Respiratory: The patient is intubated and currently tolerating mechanical ventilation well. The plan is to allow the patient to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial under assisted control, with consideration for extubation if well tolerated and ABG favorable.

High Grade SBO: The patient had surgery for SBO with partial small bowel resection and her abdomen was closed. Monitoring urine output (UOP) is important to assess fluid status and bolus as needed for UOP <30cc/h.

Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has dropped from 14.5 to 14.1 post-op. Urinalysis is negative on admission, and a repeat test shows no bacteria, with a contaminated urine culture. This is likely related to the high-grade SBO. The patient is afebrile.

Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels have resolved and are within the normal range. Initially, it was thought to be related to pain/nausea and potential Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). However, given the patient's low urine output and concentrated urine, volume depletion is more consistent. Lasix"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of abdominal surgery and subsequent development of small bowel obstruction. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/57 to 118/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 7,981 mL and output of 2,300 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,681 mL.
- The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with set tidal volume (Vt) of 0 mL and spontaneous Vt of 408 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 14 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 40%, and the respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 53.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 31.1% to 34.7%, and elevated platelet (Plt) count ranging from 287 K/uL to 405 K/uL.
- Other notable lab results include elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, elevated troponin T level, elevated CK and CKMB levels, and slightly elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a history of abdominal surgery and subsequent development of small bowel obstruction. This condition can lead to complications such as intestinal ischemia, perforation, and sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating hypotension. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Proper airway management and infection control measures should be implemented to minimize this risk.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as early mobilization and anticoagulation therapy should be considered.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for these potential complications and take appropriate measures to prevent or manage them promptly if they arise."

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of abdominal surgery who has been admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and respiratory failure. The patient underwent re-exploration and lysis of adhesions, which resulted in improved bowel findings. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has a history of SBO, which can be caused by various factors such as intussusception, adhesions, or other obstructions. The risk of recurrence or worsening of the obstruction should be closely monitored.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure secondary to an intra-abdominal process. There is a concern for possible worsening of respiratory status with extubation due to significant positive fluid balance. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and frequent evaluation with arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which may require careful management with appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasoactive medications. Close monitoring of blood pressure and urine output is essential.

4. Infection: The patient has a history of allergies to multiple antibiotics, including anaphylaxis to Tolmetin sodium and phenytoin sodium extended. Therefore, caution should be exercised when selecting antibiotics for treatment of potential infections.

5. Nutritional Support: Due to the patient being NPO (nothing by mouth), nutritional"

   Disposition: ICU level of care.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of small bowel obstruction (SBO), partial small bowel resection, and abdomen left open. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a high-grade SBO, which can lead to complications such as intestinal ischemia, necrosis, and perforation if not managed appropriately.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, fluid loss, or ongoing bleeding. It is important to monitor her blood pressure closely and provide appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support if necessary.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 14.1 yesterday to 15.3 today. This could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation in the body.

4. Respiratory status: The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently tolerating nasal cannula oxygen at 4 liters per minute. Close monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress or deterioration is essential.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient initially presented with hyponatremia, but it has resolved with appropriate management. The sodium level is now within the normal range.

6. Acute atraumatic left knee pain/leg spasms: The patient is experiencing acute knee pain"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is an 83-year-old female who underwent partial small bowel resection and had her abdomen left open on [**7-8**]. She was re-explored and closed on [**7-9**].
- She is currently in the ICU for management and has a small bowel obstruction (SBO).
- The patient was extubated yesterday and is tolerating nasal cannula oxygen at 4 liters.
- Her white blood cell count has increased from 14.1 yesterday to 15.3 today, which could be due to the high-grade SBO or stress dose steroids.
- She is afebrile and her urine analysis is negative for bacteria. Her urine culture is contaminated.
- Her chest X-ray shows nothing acute.
- The patient has hyponatremia, which has resolved with a normal sodium level of 136 today. Initially, it was thought to be related to SIADH, but it is now believed to be due to volume depletion.
- Her home lasix has been held while in the house.
- She is being monitored for any signs of respiratory distress, abdominal compartment syndrome, and small bowel obstruction.
- The patient also has acute atraumatic left knee pain and leg spasms, but no inflammatory changes or fractures on X-ray.
- She has a history of osteoporosis and compression fractures, but no acute issues at the moment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions, including osteoporosis, interstitial lung disease, multiple sclerosis, and chronic lower extremity edema. She was admitted to the ICU after undergoing exploratory laparotomy with partial small bowel resection due to small bowel obstruction. The patient's current medications include hydrocortisone, lasix, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and famotidine. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 108/44 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a history of SBO, which led to her exploratory laparotomy and bowel resection. It is important to monitor for signs of recurrent obstruction or complications related to the surgery.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 108/44 mmHg, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate management with fluids and medications are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 14.1 yesterday to 15.3 today, suggesting leukocytosis. Further investigation and monitoring for infection or other causes are required."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. 

1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a high-grade SBO, which occurred after undergoing exploratory laparotomy with partial small bowel resection. The abdomen was closed, and the patient will be followed up with surgery recommendations. There is a concern for abdominal compartment syndrome.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, but not in shock. This could be related to the SBO and fluid loss. The patient has received IV fluids and diuretics as needed.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient was extubated and is currently tolerating a nasal cannula at 2 liters. There are signs of pulmonary edema with crackles on examination. The patient has a history of interstitial lung disease and is on home inhalers. Nebulizer treatments have been increased, and lasix was given.

4. Oliguria/hyponatremia: Initially thought to be due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), but further evaluation suggests volume depletion rather than excess fluid retention. The patient's sodium levels are within normal range, and she has responded well to lasix.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 14.1 yesterday to 15.3 today. This could be related to the high-grade SBO or stress dose steroids"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of interstitial lung disease, small bowel obstruction, hypotension, oliguria/hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and chronic LE edema. She underwent partial small bowel resection and had her abdomen left open on [**7-8**]. The patient was re-explored and the abdomen was closed on [**7-9**].

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory: The patient is extubated and tolerating NC at 2L. She has evidence of pulmonary edema with crackles on exam and good output to lasix. She is on home inhalers for her baseline interstitial lung disease.
   - Increase home nebs (advair [**Hospital1**] and albuterol prn)
   - Repeat lasix IV bolus today

2. High Grade SBO: The patient had a partial small bowel resection and the abdomen was closed. She will follow up with surgery recommendations and monitor for signs of abdominal compartment syndrome.

3. Oliguria/Hyponatremia: The patient's oliguria/hyponatremia has resolved, and her sodium level is in the normal range. Initially, it was thought to be related to SIADH, but it is now more consistent with volume depletion. Her home lasix has been held while in the hospital. She received"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of high-grade small bowel obstruction (SBO), partial small bowel resection, and an open abdomen. She was transferred to the ICU for management. The patient has several medical complications, including interstitial lung disease, oliguria/hyponatremia, leukocytosis, diabetes mellitus, acute atraumatic left knee pain/leg spasms, osteoporosis/compression fractures, dyslipidemia, allergic rhinitis, multiple sclerosis, and chronic LE edema.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.5 C (99.5 F)
- Heart Rate: 86 bpm (75-98 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 126/72 mmHg (76-146/72-84 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 23 breaths per minute (18-33 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen Saturation: 97% on nasal cannula at 4L

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles/wheeze in the anterior lung fields bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, distended, and shows decreased bowel sounds. Neurological assessment is not performed.

   ETC)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   .
   This is a 83 yo female with high grade SBO now POD #3 s/p partial small
   bowel resection with abdomen left open on [**7-8**], re-exploration and
   closure on [**7-9**], now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for management.
   .
   #  Respiratory:  Pt extubated.  Currently tolerating NC at 4L. Has e/o
   pulm edema with crackles on exam and good output to lasix. Has baseline
   interstitial lung disease for which she is on home inhalers.
   - increase home nebs  to standing advair [**Hospital1 **] and albuterol prn q8h
   - repeat lasix IV bolus today for goal of -1L
   .
   #  High Grade SBO / FENGI: s/p ex lap with partial small bowel
   resection, abdomen closed. NGT d/c
   - will f/u surgery recs
   --will monitor for signs of abd compartment syndrome
   -- pt feeling nauseous today with juice. will reduce diet to clears,
   and zofran x1 for improved PO intake
   .
   #  Oliguria / Hyponatremia: Resolved, sodium in normal range. Initially
   thought [**1-24**] pain/nausea related SIADH. Her home lasix has been held
   while in house. However, given [**Month (only) **] PO intake and Urine studies with
   Na<10 (and Hgb concentrated), more consistent with volume depletion.
   Na 136 today. Given 10 Lasix yesterday for low UOP, responded well.
   - cont to monitor AM/PM lytes
   - IVF, w/ Lasix bolus today again
   .
   #  Leukocytosis: WBC increased from 14.1 yesterday to 15.3 today. UA
   neg on admission, repeat with wbc but no bacteria, urine culture
   contaminated. CXR nothing acute. Likely related to high-grade SBO or
   stress dose steroids.  She is afebrile.
   -f/u Cx, no abx currently
   -cont to monitor WBC
   .
   # DM: Pt has functionally been NPO, has had FS in 50-70s. On RISS, but
   not given any. Hypoglycemia probably due to NPO and pt without any IVF
   (D5), although given pt on steroids, would expect higher FS. Although
   less likely, if she continues to be hypoglycemic, can consider
   potential underlying process (stressor, i.e. inflammation/infection,
   s/p surgery) for which she is not mounting a response to.
   - cont FS monitoring
   - advance diet to clears per above
   .
   #  Acute atraumatic L knee pain/LE spasms: No history of trauma. On
   exam, no inflamm changes (effusion/erythema). Xray no fx and no
   effusion. Unclear etiology. No h/o gout/psuedogout but is at risk, esp
   given elevated ESR/CRP, though would have expected some inflamm
   changes. Not typical for sciatica. No DVT on LENIs.
   -now on 25 mg hydrocortisone (equivalent to home dose)
   -cont morphine 2mg q3h IV prn.
   -if worsening, consider rheum consult for further eval
   .
   #  Osteoporosis/compression fractures:  No acute issues.
   -holding Ca+Vit D and fosamax home until taking good POs. no acute
   issues.
   .
   #  Dyslipidemia - holding home POs lipitor until taking good POs
   .
   #  Allergic Rhinitis: flonase [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #  Multiple Sclerosis: No active issues.
   .
   #  Chronic LE edema: On chronic lasix at home of [**10-11**] QOD.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  83 yo F h/o inflammatory arthritis of
   unclear etiology, osteoporosis, ARDS post MVA trauma, hyperlipidemia
   admitted [**7-5**] with knee pain. Course c/b high grade SBO s/p ex-lap [**7-8**]
   with small bowel resection and re-exploration w/ closure of abd on
   [**7-9**].
   She responded well to lasix diuresis yesterday.  Poor PO, c/o nausea.
   She remains AF  BP 120/72   HR 80's  RR 23 with sat 97% on 4L NC   cvp
   8,  i/o --> -3100
   She is alert and in NAD.  Her lungs still have rales but wheezing had
   resolved.  RR, abd midline wound site c/d/I, NT, soft, +BS, trace
   edema, warm
   Labs notable for WBC 13.4, HCT 31,  na 139, K 3.6, Cr 0.3, glu 53
   CXR is rotated with stable b/l effusion l> r, full hilar vessels, no
   change from prior
   Micro--cx's with ngtd
   Agree with plan to continue supportive post-op care after resection of
   high grade SBO. She remains on NC O2 but is responding well to diuresis
   and appears more comfortable from resp standpoint. Her cxr continues to
   show effusions, hilar vascular fullness and she has dependent edema.
   Will continue to diurese gently for goal 1 L neg following lytes. Will
   change to standing combivent nebs, noting her wheeze has improved. Will
   wean O2.  Leukocytosis is mild, stable and she remains AF.  F/u pending
   cxs data with ngtd.   Remains on IV equivalent of home prednisone dose
   for inflammatory arthritis.  Will continue to encourage POs, advancing
   diet as per surgical team and monitoring blood sugars which have been
   intermittently low.  Zofran as needed if nausea continues to limit
   intake. Additional post-op care per surgical team. Remainder of plan as
   outlined in resident note.
   ICU: sc line, boots, h2b, sq hep.
   Stable for transfer to surgery service.
