   Assessment and Plan
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 87 yoM with cardiac history as well as squamous cell
   on face, admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum
   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. UNILATERAL EFFUSION: less likely CHF b/c of left-sided unilateral
   nature, though appears to have element of volume overload;
   parapneumonic effusion most likley, and would consider post-obstructive
   PNA given degree to which whole lung is affect and smoking history
   (thought had a normal PE four days ago at PCP's office per the pt).
   Also with question of hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (esp
   with the hypoxia)
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- will order UA/UCx for reported increased urinary output
   -- no CP, but will cycle enzymes
   -- will order TTE
   -- will treat empirically with azithro/ceftriaxone for CAP
   -- will obtain CTA after thoracentesis to evaluate for empyema,
   complicated effusion, etc.
   .
   #. COPD/ASTHMA: not sure which diagnosis he carries; records in
   computer incomplete
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- nebs prn
   .
   #. AFIB:
   -- rate better now after fluids in ED
   -- will hold on dilt given hypotension; will restart as tolerated
   -- not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; will place on SSI
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly individual with a history of cardiac issues, admitted for shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has multiple medical conditions including COPD/asthma, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and previous pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart rate: 81 bpm (normal range: 72-92 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 113/46 mmHg (61/36 mmHg - 122/62 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (normal range: 17-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 92%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has been receiving several medications, including furosemide (Lasix) and diltiazem. They have also been on Percocet and Tylenol, resulting in rashes and itchiness. The patient has been treated with ceftriaxone and cefepime antibiotics.

The patient's physical examination reveals several findings, including poor dentition, clear oropharynx, tacky mucous membranes, end-expiratory wheezes on the right side, high-pitched sounds, rhonchi, and crackles throughout the left lung. The patient is using accessory muscles for breathing"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and pink frothy sputum production. The patient's left lung is whiteout, indicating possible consolidation. The patient has a history of smoking and presented with high-pitched wheezes in both lungs. 

The patient has developed a pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space around the lungs. The effusion is likely due to a bacterial infection, specifically pneumonia. The patient has received antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Blood cultures and UCX (a marker of infection) are pending. A thoracentesis was performed to remove fluid from the pleural space for analysis.

The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen delivery. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note. 

On physical examination, the patient has bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities, multiple skin ulcers and abrasions, and a large area of skin graft or post-surgery on the left fronto-parietal forehead/head. The patient's vital signs show stable heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 92%.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.1 K"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient experienced tachycardia and chest pain this morning. The patient has allergies to Percocet and Tylenol. They have been receiving antibiotics, including ceftriaxone and cefepime, as well as other ICU medications such as furosemide and diltiazem. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for chest pain and the development of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/64 mmHg to 122/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support and their ABG results indicate respiratory failure. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, but the patient is tachycardic with crackles in the right lung and trace edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal troponin levels. Other lab values, including electrolytes and cardiac markers, are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 87 yoM with cardiac history as well as squamous cell
   on face, admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum
   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. UNILATERAL EFFUSION: less likely CHF b/c of left-sided unilateral
   nature, though appears to have element of volume overload;
   parapneumonic effusion most likley, and would consider post-obstructive
   PNA given degree to which whole lung is affect and smoking history
   (thought had a normal PE four days ago at PCP's office per the pt).
   Also with question of hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (esp
   with the hypoxia).  s/p thoracentesis.   IP evaluated patient and
   recommended VATS, which the patient refused.
   -- D/C azithro/ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP
   -- Start Vanc/Cefepime for HAP
   -- f/u blood cultures, ucx
   -- will order TTE
   -- will obtain CT chest to evaluate for empyema, complicated effusion,
   etc.
   -- consult IP re: pleurocentesis of loculated effusion
   .
   #. COPD/ASTHMA: not sure which diagnosis he carries; records in
   computer incomplete
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- nebs prn
   .
   #. AFIB:  Back in a fib with RVR
   -- rate better now after fluids in ED
   -- Diltiazem drip for rate control
   -- not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- start ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   #. PPX: home PPI, SQH, bowel reg PRN
   .
   #. CONTACT: with patient, had friends who are [**Name (NI) 11045**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 484**] and

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a cardiac history and squamous cell carcinoma on his face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and production of pink frothy sputum. The patient also has a smoking history and was found to have a whiteout of the left lung on a chest X-ray.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFib), pleural effusion, and is suspected to have a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) or mass due to the presence of hypoxia. The patient underwent thoracentesis and was started on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient is receiving IV fluids, diltiazem for rate control in AFib, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and normal troponin-T levels. The imaging shows moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%, right ventricular cavity dilation, trace aortic regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation. There is also a trivial/physiological pericard"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing for three days, along with pink frothy sputum production and whiteout of the left lung.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 109 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/66 mmHg to 77/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and an acute pleural effusion. The effusion is believed to be parapneumonic in nature, possibly related to a post-obstructive pneumonia given the patient's smoking history. There is also a possibility of a pulmonary embolism or mass, considering the presence of hemoptysis and hypoxia.

The patient underwent a thoracentesis and was started on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been obtained, and a transthoracic echo (TTE) has been ordered. A CT chest is planned to evaluate for empyema or complicated effusion. Consultation for pleurocentesis of the loculated effusion has been recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a cardiac history, admitted for shortness of breath and pink frothy sputum production. He has a whiteout of the left lung and is experiencing right-sided heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), as shown in the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient also has acute pleural effusion, which is likely due to a parapneumonic effusion, possibly related to post-obstructive pneumonia given his smoking history. Other findings include mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, trace aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, and trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic heart failure (HFrEF) - The patient presents with weight gain, pitting edema bilaterally, elevated creatinine, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, indicating acute decompensation of chronic heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid status and diuretic therapy is necessary.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to hypoxia and the presence of a loculated pleural effusion. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is required.
3. Infection - The patient has been treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is now being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia ("

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on his face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, coughing up pink frothy sputum, and a whiteout of the left lung. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFIB), a unilateral pulmonary infiltrate, and a possible pleural effusion. 

The patient initially received azithromycin and ceftriaxone for presumed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but this treatment was discontinued, and he was started on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient's transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, trace aortic regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation. 

The patient refused a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure recommended by the interventional pulmonologist (IP) to address the loculated pleural effusion. 

The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the final read of the CT chest is still pending.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on his face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 103/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is currently on Diltiazem drip for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He has been diagnosed with pleural effusion, likely due to parapneumonic effusion or post-obstructive pneumonia, and started on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient has refused video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for the loculated pleural effusion. Other medical conditions include COPD/asthma, atrial fibrillation, systolic and likely diastolic heart failure, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's history of heart failure and the current fluid overload status may increase the risk of flash pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of fluid status is necessary.
2. Worsening respiratory status: The patient's respiratory distress and whiteout of the left lung indicate a potential worsening respiratory status. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia and a complicated parapneumonic effusion. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and a SpO2 of 91%. He has been on various antibiotics and is receiving supportive care. The patient has expressed his wish to be DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure indicates a compromised respiratory system. There is a risk of further deterioration, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia progression: Despite being on antibiotics, there is a possibility of pneumonia worsening, leading to sepsis and systemic infection.
3. Pleural effusion: The presence of a large left-sided pneumonia with significant effusion increases the risk of complications such as tension pneumothorax or empyema.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AFIB) can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which may contribute to inadequate cardiac output and worsen hypoxemia.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing blood clots, which can potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism if dislodged.
6. Hospital-acquired infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring hospital"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath and pink frothy sputum production. The patient has pneumonia, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and a pleural effusion. The patient refused VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) for the loculated pleural effusion. The initial treatment included azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which was later switched to vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's SpO2 decreases when anxious. The plan is to continue vancomycin and cefepime for HAP, azithromycin to cover atypical organisms, and monitor fluid status carefully. The patient does not wish to be intubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash pulmonary edema due to diastolic and systolic dysfunction.
2. Volume overload leading to acute respiratory distress.
3. Pneumonia progression and sepsis.
4. Hemodynamic instability due to AFib.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility.
6. Hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion or embolic phenomenon.
7. Complications from non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or int"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac disease and squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the given information:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. The initial treatment included antibiotics (Azithro/Ceftriaxone), but this was discontinued and replaced with Vanc/Cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's SpO2 levels decrease when anxious, indicating that anxiety may contribute to desaturation.

2. Acute Pleural Effusion: The patient has an acute pleural effusion, which is a collection of fluid in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. Thoracentesis was performed, and a CT imaging showed a loculated pleural effusion. VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) was recommended but declined by the patient.

3. Cardiac Hypokinesis: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed new left ventricular hypokinesis, indicating impaired heart function. Given the patient's age and tenuous health, careful monitoring of fluid status is necessary to prevent flash pulmonary edema.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is in atrial fibrillation"

   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral pulmonary infiltrate.
   Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to have
   element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely, and
   would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole lung is
   affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days ago at
   PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis, making
   mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  Re-evaluation of the CT while awaiting
   final read appears as though patient has dense, possibly
   post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient was initially on
   Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
   [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient
   becomes anxious, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP and azithromycin to cover atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   -- send sputum culture if starts bringing up sputum
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema
   -- 20 IV lasix this morning, goal -500cc today, given CXR, wheeze
   (?cardiac wheeze), pedal edema
   -- morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- consider haldol for anxiety (as anxiety was trigger for hypoxia)
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- daily CXR
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Change IV to PO metoprolol (metoprolol 50mg tid) as taking PO
   without difficulty now
   -- Lasix this AM, as above
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Lasix as above, diuresis
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol as needed for agitation as that was previously
   related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and a white-out of the left lung. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypoxia, particularly while sleeping, and has been using accessory muscles for breathing. The chest X-ray showed worsening pulmonary edema. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/47 mmHg to 156/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and in CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. 

Physical examination findings include diffuse wheezing bilaterally, no murmurs, soft abdomen with no tenderness, and dense pitting edema in both feet and distal legs. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, elevated troponin-T level of 0.13, and increased lactic acid level of 1.0 mmol/L. The chest X-ray indicates worsening pulmonary edema.

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous
   cell CA on face, admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum
   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral pulmonary infiltrate.
   Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to have
   element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely, and
   would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole lung is
   affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days ago at
   PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis, making
   mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  Re-evaluation of the CT while awaiting
   final read appears as though patient has dense, possibly
   post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient was initially on
   Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
   [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient
   becomes anxious, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP and azithromycin to cover atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, urine culture
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema
   -- f/u IP recs, if any given the patient refused VATS
   -- morphine for SOB and anxiety prn; start 1-2mg IV q4h prn
   -- Haldol for anxiety prn
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- daily CXR
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- nebs prn (but watch use of albuterol given tachycardia)
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   -- Consider lasix if acute SOB but feel pneumonia is key factor, not
   volume overload (plus Cr bumped today)
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain.
   -- Diltiazem drip previously d/c
ed for rate control
   -- Changed metoprolol 50mg tid to IV 10mg q4h given difficulty taking
   PO
   -- Hope for autodiuresis with better rate control and forward flow;
   hold Lasix diuresis for today, re-evaluate tomorrow
   -- Consider lasix if acute SOB but feel pneumonia is key factor, not
   volume overload (plus Cr bumped today)[]
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Re-evaluate daily and need for Lasix diuresis; hold for today
   - Consider lasix if acute SOB
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Haldol PRN
   - EKG today for QT prolongation
   - Reorient frequently

   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and an acute pleural effusion. He has a history of smoking and has undergone a thoracentesis with CT imaging. The patient initially received antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) but was later switched to treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's respiratory status has been improving with the use of bipap and nebulized albuterol. He is currently on CPAP support and has shown improvement in his oxygen saturation levels. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a unilateral pulmonary infiltrate, which is less likely to be caused by congestive heart failure due to its unilateral nature. However, there appears to be an element of volume overload. The possibility of parapneumonic effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia is being considered given the patient's smoking history. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing agitation and disorientation, especially when his SpO2 levels decrease. This could be due to hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion or an embolic phenomenon related to AF"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and a white-out of the left lung. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, acute pleural effusion, and possibly diastolic and systolic heart failure. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as azithromycin to cover atypical pathogens. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in oxygen saturation, respiratory status, and fluid balance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's fluid status needs to be carefully monitored to prevent flash pulmonary edema due to diastolic and systolic dysfunction.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion or embolic phenomenon due to atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which increases the risk of bleeding complications during treatment.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetes management should be closely monitored, and any potential diabetic ketoacidosis should be promptly addressed.
5. End-of-Life Care: Considering the patient's age and tenuous health, end-of-life care considerations should be discussed with the"

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and right ventricular overload, currently admitted to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to left-sided pneumonia. The patient's condition is critical, and he has been started on vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics. He requires high-flow oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient has dense infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating ongoing pulmonary edema. He also has altered mental status, which has improved today. The patient's heart rate is well controlled at this time. The patient has a pleural effusion and is DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate). The plan includes continuing the current antibiotics, supportive care, and attempting a negative fluid balance by diuresis. Nebulizer treatments will also be continued. Prophylactic beta blockers will be given for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and stress ulcer prophylaxis will be continued. The patient's code status remains DNR/DNI, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous
   cell CA on face, admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum
   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral pulmonary infiltrate.
   Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to have
   element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely, and
   would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole lung is
   affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days ago at
   PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis, making
   mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  Re-evaluation of the CT while awaiting
   final read appears as though patient has dense, possibly
   post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient was initially on
   Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
   [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient
   becomes anxious, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP and azithromycin to cover atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema
   -- can repeat 20 IV lasix again today, goal -500cc today, given CXR,
   wheeze (?cardiac wheeze), pedal edema
   -- morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- consider haldol for anxiety (as anxiety was trigger for hypoxia)
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- daily CXR
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Change IV to PO metoprolol (metoprolol 50mg tid) as taking PO
   without difficulty now
   -- Lasix this AM, as above
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Lasix as above, diuresis
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol as needed for agitation as that was previously
   related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved
   now with improved SpO2.
   - Reorient
   - If clinical picture changes, consider CT head
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed, f/u recs
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   # FEN:  Regular diet
   .
   #. PPX: home PPI, SQH, bowel regimen
 goal BM today

","The patient is a 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has pneumonia, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and pleural effusion. 

The patient initially received Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia but was switched to Vancomycin and Cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's condition has worsened, with worsening pneumonia and a new loculated pleural effusion. 

The plan includes continuing with Vancomycin and Cefepime for HAP, adding azithromycin to cover atypical organisms, monitoring fluid status due to heart failure, and providing symptomatic relief with morphine. The patient has refused VATS for the loculated pleural effusion. 

The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and evidence of systolic and diastolic heart failure. 

The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with episodes of agitation and disorientation, possibly due to hypoxia. 

The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate order and is currently in the ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous
   cell CA on face, admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum
   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral pulmonary infiltrate.
   Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to have
   element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely, and
   would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole lung is
   affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days ago at
   PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis, making
   mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  Re-evaluation of the CT while awaiting
   final read appears as though patient has dense, possibly
   post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient was initially on
   Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
   [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient
   becomes anxious, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP
   -- last dose of 5 day course of azithromycin today ([**12-30**]) for coverage
   of atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- daily CXR
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in negative fluid
   balance.
   -- morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- consider haldol for anxiety (as anxiety was trigger for hypoxia)
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Continue metoprolol 50mg TID
   -- diuresis with Lasix prn
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Lasix as above, diuresis
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol as needed for agitation as that was previously
   related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved
   now with improved SpO2.
   - Reorient
   - If clinical picture changes, consider CT head
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed, f/u recs
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient's medical conditions include pneumonia, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFib), pleural effusion (acute), and possibly congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/47 mmHg to 165/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia, metoprolol for rate control in AFib, Lasix for fluid overload, and morphine for shortness of breath and anxiety. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, and abnormal kidney function.

Imaging studies reveal complete opacification of the left lung and increased right upper lobe consolidation, most compatible with worsening pneumonia. The patient has refused VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) for loculated pleural effusion.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and respiratory failure due to left-sided pneumonia. The patient is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) and is not intubated.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 beats per minute with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 128/60 to 165/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a face mask and is receiving fluids and medications through IV lines.

The patient's lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and troponin T. Other lab results such as glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient's chest X-ray shows signs of a pneumonic process at the apex of the lungs. The assessment and plan include pneumonia, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation, and acute pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening respiratory failure, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia), cardiac arrhythmias, and further deterioration of mental status."

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous
   cell CA on face, admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum
   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary
   infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to
   have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely,
   and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole
   lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days
   ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis,
   making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense pneumonia. Patient was
   initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this
   was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When
   patient becomes anxious or removes his O2 mask, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP
   - If spikes, add levoflox
   -- patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin (finished [**12-30**]) for
   coverage of atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- daily CXR
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in negative fluid
   balance.
   -- morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- consider haldol for anxiety (as anxiety was trigger for hypoxia)
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Continue metoprolol 50mg TID
   -- diuresis with Lasix prn
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Lasix as above, diuresis
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol as needed for agitation as that was previously
   related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved
   now with improved SpO2.
   - Reorient
   - If clinical picture changes, consider CT head

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on his face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and white out of the left lung. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, respiratory failure, constipation, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and acute pleural effusion.

The patient initially received treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with azithromycin and ceftriaxone but was switched to vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's SpO2 decreases when anxious or removing the O2 mask, indicating the need for continued Vanc/Cefepime therapy. Levofloxacin may be added if spikes occur. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and daily chest X-rays are recommended. Nebulizers and prn albuterol use should be cautious due to tachycardia.

The patient has [Hospital1]-ventricular hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic dysfunction. Fluid status should be monitored carefully to prevent flash pulmonary edema. Lasix may be given as needed to keep the patient in negative fluid balance.

Morphine may be used for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h. Haldol may be considered for anxiety, as anxiety triggers hypox"

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac disease and squamous cell carcinoma of the face, admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, other, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), pleural effusion, acute, and constipation (obstipation, fos).

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung indicate a possible respiratory failure due to pneumonia.

2. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pedal edema and rapid weight gain suggest the possibility of flash pulmonary edema, which can occur in patients with heart failure.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and there is no mention of anticoagulation. Therefore, there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Hypoxic Cerebral Hypoperfusion: The patient's agitation and disorientation when SpO2 decreases indicate the possibility of hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion.

5. End-of-Life Care: The patient's age and tenuous health condition raise concerns about end-of-life care, which may involve palliative measures.

6. Diabetic Complications: Although not explicitly mentioned, the"

   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous
   cell CA on face, admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum
   production and white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral pulmonary infiltrate.
   Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to have
   element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely, and
   would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole lung is
   affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days ago at
   PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis, making
   mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  Re-evaluation of the CT while awaiting
   final read appears as though patient has dense, possibly
   post-obstructive pneumonia. Patient was initially on
   Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
   [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient
   becomes anxious, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP
   -- last dose of 5 day course of azithromycin today ([**12-30**]) for coverage
   of atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- daily CXR
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in negative fluid
   balance.
   -- morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- consider haldol for anxiety (as anxiety was trigger for hypoxia)
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Continue metoprolol 50mg TID
   -- diuresis with Lasix prn
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Lasix as above, diuresis
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol as needed for agitation as that was previously
   related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved
   now with improved SpO2.
   - Reorient
   - If clinical picture changes, consider CT head

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. This condition can worsen if not properly treated, leading to further respiratory distress and potential sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, as indicated by low oxygen saturation levels (SpO2: 90%). This condition can lead to hypoxemia and even death if not promptly addressed.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, an irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. The patient's rapid ventricular response (RVR) needs to be controlled to prevent complications such as heart failure or embolic events.

4. Heart failure (HF): The patient appears to have acute-on-chronic heart failure, as evidenced by symptoms such as weight gain, pitting edema, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. This condition can worsen if fluid status is not carefully managed, leading to pulmonary edema or other cardiovascular complications.

5. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing episodes of agitation, disorientation, and altered mental status. These symptoms could be attributed to hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion or other underlying conditions, which need to be monitored and managed appropriately.

6. Diabetic ketoacidosis ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-inch tall and 74.9 kg male who was admitted with chief complaints of pneumonia and respiratory distress. He has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, for his pneumonia. The patient's current condition shows improvement in his respiratory status, with a SpO2 of 96% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery. However, he experienced an episode of confusion and agitation this evening, during which his O2 saturation dropped to the high 80s. Haloperidol was given, and he showed improvement with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 94%. The plan is to readdress the patient's code status/end-of-life issues on Monday if there is no improvement in his respiratory status over the weekend.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's initial presentation of pneumonia and respiratory distress suggests a potential for further respiratory complications. These may include worsening respiratory distress, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or even respiratory failure if his respiratory status does not improve.

2. Delirium: The patient's episode of confusion and agitation indicates a possible delirium. Delirium can be caused by various factors such as infections, medication side effects, or metabolic disturbances. It is important to monitor for any changes in mental status and address potential underlying causes.

3. Constipation: The patient has a diagnosis of constipation, which can be exacerbated by medications and"

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,

   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary
   infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to
   have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely,
   and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole
   lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days
   ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis,
   making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense pneumonia. Patient was
   initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this
   was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When
   patient becomes anxious or removes his O2 mask, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP
   - If spikes, add levoflox
   -- patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin (finished [**12-30**]) for
   coverage of atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- daily CXR
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in negative fluid
   balance.
   -- morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- consider haldol for anxiety (as anxiety was trigger for hypoxia)
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Continue metoprolol 50mg TID
   -- diuresis with Lasix prn
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Lasix as above, diuresis
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol as needed for agitation as that was previously
   related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved
   now with improved SpO2.
   - Reorient
   - If clinical picture changes, consider CT head
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed, f/u recs, please ask them to readdress
   these issues on Monday if patient is not improved.

   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and white-out of the left lung. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, acute pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, agitation, disorientation, diabetes, and end-of-life care considerations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a lung infection. This can be complicated by the presence of a parapneumonic effusion and post-obstructive pneumonia due to his smoking history. Treatment involves antibiotics such as vancomycin and cefepime.
2. Acute Pleural Effusion: The patient has developed an acute pleural effusion, which is the accumulation of fluid in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. This can cause respiratory distress and may require drainage through thoracentesis or other interventions.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing AFib, an irregular heart rhythm. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and contribute to symptoms of heart failure. Rate control measures like diltiazem and beta-blockers are being used to manage the AFib.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient appears to have acute-on-chronic CHF, as indicated by symptoms"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a cardiac history and squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, acute pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, systolic and likely diastolic heart failure, agitation, disorientation, and diabetes.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening of pneumonia leading to sepsis or respiratory failure, progression of heart failure resulting in cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema, development of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and atrial fibrillation, worsening of renal function due to dehydration or cardiorenal syndrome, and further decline in mental status leading to delirium or coma.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, fluid balance, and respiratory status. Frequent reassessment of the patient's mental status and regular reorientation are necessary. Appropriate management of pain and anxiety with medications like morphine and haloperidol should be considered. The patient's fluid status should be carefully monitored to prevent fluid overload, and diuretics may be used as needed. Regular communication with the patient and his family is crucial for end-of-life care discussions and decision-making."

   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient also has a smoking history.

The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, respiratory distress, confusion, agitation, diastolic and systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pleural effusion, and leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/50mmHg to 156/67mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal troponin T levels. The patient's imaging shows improved aeration of the left lung.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia, adding levofloxacin if needed, monitoring blood cultures and sputum cultures, performing daily chest X-rays, administering nebulizers as needed, using CPAP as necessary, giving lasix 40mg IV today, considering haldol or morphine for shortness of breath"

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary
   infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to
   have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely,
   and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole
   lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days
   ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis,
   making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense pneumonia. Patient was
   initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this
   was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When
   patient becomes anxious or removes his O2 mask, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP
   -- If spikes, add levoflox
   -- patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin (finished [**12-30**]) for
   coverage of atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- daily CXR
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in negative fluid
   balance. Plan to give pt lasix 40mg IV today.
   -- consider haldol or morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Continue metoprolol 50mg TID
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Lasix as above, diuresis
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed, f/u recs, will need to readdress these
   issues on Monday if patient is not improved.
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   Less active issue:
   .
   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved
   now with improved SpO2.

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary
   infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to
   have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely,
   and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole
   lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days
   ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis,
   making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense pneumonia. Patient was
   initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this
   was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When
   patient becomes anxious or removes his O2 mask, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course
   -- If spikes, add levoflox
   -- patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin (finished [**12-30**]) for
   coverage of atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- daily CXR
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in negative fluid
   balance. Plan to give pt lasix 40mg IV today.
   -- consider haldol or morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Given relative bradycardia, change metoprolol 50mg TID to 25mg tid
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none now
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on PO flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Hold on diuresis today
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed, f/u recs, will need to readdress these
   issues on Monday if patient is not improved.
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   Less active issue:
   .
   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved
   now with improved SpO2.
   - Reorient

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and right ventricular overload, currently admitted to the MICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to left-sided pneumonia. 

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are not intubated. The patient has been receiving a 14-day course of vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection and started on Flagyl for 14 days.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius (96.9 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 139/47 mmHg to 144/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, symmetric breath sounds with rhonchi throughout the chest, right lower extremity edema of 1+, left lower extremity edema of 1+, warm skin, and somnolent but arousable neurologic status.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 9.5 to 18.8 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin ranging from 29.0 to 31.9 grams per deciliter, platelet count ranging from 139 to 261 thousand cells per microliter, creatinine ranging from 1.5 to 2.7 milligrams per deciliter, glucose ranging from 103 to 156 milligrams per deciliter, and other lab values within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes constipation, pneumonia, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The plan includes continuing antibiotics for pneumonia, treatment for Clostridium difficile infection, and management of other issues as per the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure leading to the need for intubation, development of septic shock due to the ongoing infection, progression of Clostridium difficile infection leading to colitis, and deep vein thrombosis due to immobilization."

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary
   infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to
   have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely,
   and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole
   lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days
   ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis,
   making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense pneumonia. Patient was
   initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this
   was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When
   patient becomes anxious or removes his O2 mask, SpO2 decreases.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course
   -- If spikes, add levoflox
   -- patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin (finished [**12-30**]) for
   coverage of atypicals
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- daily CXR
   -- nebs standing and prn (but cautious use of albuterol given
   tachycardia)
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in negative fluid
   balance. Plan to give pt lasix 40mg IV today.
   -- consider haldol or morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- CPAP as needed
   -- cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Given relative bradycardia, change metoprolol 50mg TID to 25mg tid
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none now
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily

   # C. diff infection
   - Started on PO flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1

   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Hold on diuresis today
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   - Morphine PRN as above
   .
   # Agitation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed, f/u recs, will need to readdress these
   issues on Monday if patient is not improved.

   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   Less active issue:

   # Disorientation: Patient, while hypoxic, felt vertical while was
   horizontal in bed. Consider hypoxic cerebral hypoperfusion, verus
   embolic phenomenom d/t afib without anticoagulation. Symptoms resolved
   now with improved SpO2.
   - Reorient

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and has been placed on non-invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/47 mmHg to 144/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is also experiencing fatigue and has an indentation on the nose from the mask.

The patient's medications include Percocet, Tylenol, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. His allergies are listed as rash from Percocet and itch from Tylenol.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and C-reactive protein. The results also indicate positive Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin.

Imaging studies reveal no significant change in the left lower lobe, left upper lobe, and right upper lobe consolidations, with slightly better aeration of the left upper lobe compared to the previous study. There is also a likely pleural effusion on the left side.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and a whiteout of the left lung. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, respiratory failure, constipation, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), pleural effusion, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
- Heart Rate: 76 bpm (58-85 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 137/47 mmHg (71-144/32-58 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 23 inspirations per minute (19-25 inspirations per minute)
- SpO2: 96%
- Heart rhythm: 1st AV (First degree AV Block)

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 18.8 K/uL
- Hematocrit (Hct): 27.2%
- Platelet Count (Plt): 246 K/uL
- Creatinine (Cr): 1.7 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 121 mg/dL
- Sodium (Na+): 146 mEq/L
- Potassium (K+): 4.4 mEq/L
- Calcium (Ca++): 8.5 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:
- Chest X-ray (CXR) [1-2]: No significant change in the left lower lobe, left upper lobe, and right upper lobe consolidations. There is slightly better aeration of the left upper lobe than on the prior studies with most likely present some element of atelectasis. The pleural effusion is most likely present, on the left.
- Chest X-ray (CXR) [1-3]: Pending

The patient's assessment and plan include:
- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14-day course
- Check Vancomycin trough in AM
- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
- F/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
- Daily CXR
- Nebulizers standing and prn
- Given [Hospital1]-ventricular hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not go into flash pulmonary edema; Lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic/slightly negative. Holding diuresis for now.
- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
- BiPAP as needed
- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
- Patient does not wish to be intubated

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia exacerbation: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, leading to worsening pneumonia and potential respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of cardiac issues and recent findings of systolic and likely diastolic heart failure, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or exacerbation of heart failure.
3. Pleural effusion: The presence of a pleural effusion may progress and cause respiratory compromise.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status increases the risk of delirium, which can be associated with worse outcomes.
5. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with a C. difficile infection, which requires appropriate treatment and monitoring for complications.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be managed carefully to avoid complications related to fluid imbalance.
7. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and right ventricular failure, currently admitted to the MICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by left-sided multilobar pneumonia. The patient is being treated with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and is not intubated.

The patient has been receiving a 14-day course of vancomycin and cefepime for the pneumonia. However, the recent CXR shows improvement, but the patient remains hypoxemic. The plan is to continue the antibiotics and recheck vancomycin levels tomorrow before redosing.

The patient also has constipation, which has been treated with fosaprepitant. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection and will start oral Flagyl for 14 days after completing the antibiotic course.

The patient's mental status has improved today, but other issues such as hypernatremia, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention are being managed by the ICU team.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition remains in the ICU. The patient is critically ill."

   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and white out of the left lung. The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, requiring BiPAP and high flow O2 mask. There have been concerns about skin breakdown on the patient's face. His oxygen saturation levels have been above 90% but began desat'ing around 5 am, leading to the placement of BiPAP again. Lasix 40mg IV was given.

The patient has been hallucinating and raid bombing himself in his bedroom at home. He has allergies to Percocet and Tylenol. The last doses of antibiotics were Metronidazole, Vancomycin, and Cefepime.

Infusions include Morphine sulfate and Furosemide (Lasix). The patient is on other ICU medications and has a flowsheet data showing vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and more.

Physical examination findings include NAD, alert on BiPAP, irregular heart rhythm, loud transmitted upper airway noises, positive bowel sounds, and trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

Imaging shows a dense pneumonia, and the patient has been evaluated by inter"

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and white out of the left lung. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, other, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and pleural effusion.

The patient initially received treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with azithromycin and ceftriaxone, but this was discontinued and he was started on vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has been on BiPAP for most of the day, transitioning to a high-flow O2 mask in the late afternoon due to concern for skin breakdown on the patient's face. His oxygen saturation levels have been above 90%. Around 5 am, he began desat'ing, so he was placed back on BiPAP again.

The patient has a history of smoking and is suspected to have a loculated pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was performed, and imaging is pending. The patient's chest X-ray shows a dense pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing agitation and disorientation, especially when his SpO2 decreases.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 115/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is currently 74.9 kg, and his height is 65 inches. His current fluid balance is a total intake of 1,390 mL, including 71 mL of IV fluids, and a total output of 1,640 mL, including 320 mL of urine.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 30.3 g/dL, platelet count of 261 K/uL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, glucose of 127 mg/dL, sodium of 145 mEq/L, potassium of 4.8 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mEq/L, and magnesium of 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing vancomycin and cefepime for HAP, monitoring fluid status carefully to ensure the patient does not go into flash pulmonary edema, and using lasix as needed to keep the patient euvolemic or slightly negative. The patient also requires daily chest X-rays, nebs standing, and prn use of BiPAP. Morphine and haldol may be used for SOB and anxiety as needed. The patient has a do not intubate (DNI) and do not resuscitate (DNR) code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration of mental status, development of heart failure, and worsening of hypernatremia."

   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary
   infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though appears to
   have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most likely,
   and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which whole
   lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four days
   ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of hemotpysis,
   making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the hypoxia).  S/p
   thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to show loculated
   pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no pleural effusion
   or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular hypokinesis.  IP
   evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated pleural effusion,
   which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense pneumonia. Patient was
   initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric treatment of CAP, but this
   was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When
   patient becomes anxious or removes his O2 mask, SpO2 decreases. The
   patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin (finished [**12-30**]) for
   coverage of atypicals
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course
   -- Check Vanco trough in AM
   -- If spikes, can add levoflox
   -- f/u blood cultures, sputum cultures
   -- daily CXR
   -- nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in
   euvolemic/slightly negative. Holding diuresis for now.
   -- consider haldol or morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with RVR.  Consider HF as a trigger given significant
   pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for rate control.
   -- Cont Metoprolol 25mg tid
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none now
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on PO flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime).
   - No loose stools
   .
   #. Hypernatremia
   - Give D5 IVF
 500cc at 160cc/hr
   - check PM sodium
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   - If clinical picture changes, consider CT head
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed, f/u recs, will need to readdress these
   issues on Monday if patient is not improved.

   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac disease and squamous cell carcinoma on his face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and white out of the left lung. The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, requiring various interventions such as BiPAP, high flow O2 mask, and high flow nasal cannula. He has been on different antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, including Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Cefepime. 

The patient's physical examination revealed bilateral pitting edema, positive bowel sounds, and irregular heart rhythm. His laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels. The patient also has a history of constipation, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and a recent diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 115/44 mmHg, heart rate of 73 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 90%. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobilization, and potential sepsis secondary to the ongoing infection. 

In terms of management, the patient's current"

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime complete on
   [**1-9**], Vanc complete on [**1-15**])
   -- Check Vanco trough in AM and dose Vanco based on level, per pharm
   -- Start Methylprednisolone 40mg IV x 5 days, given in the AM (last
   dose 12/21), given new information regarding pt
s ? chemical
   pneumonitis (although initial CXR do not suggest this) and failure to
   improve on abxs alone.
   -- If spikes, can add levoflox
   -- daily CXR
   -- nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- consider haldol or morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with controlled rate.  Consider HF as a trigger given
   significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for
   rate control.
   -- Cont Metoprolol 25mg tid
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none now
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on PO flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].
   - No loose stools
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Na today 151
   - wrote for D5 at 130cc/hr for [**2194**] mL, given
s pt
s free water deficit
   of 2.7L
   - check PM Na
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   - If clinical picture changes, consider CT head
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed, f/u recs, will need to readdress these
   issues on Monday if patient is not improved.
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Hold on diuresis today
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   # FEN:  Regular diet

   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime complete on
   [**1-9**], Vanc complete on [**1-15**])
   -- Check Vanco trough in AM and dose Vanco based on level
   -- Start Methylprednisolone 40mg IV x 5 days, given in the AM (last
   dose 12/21), given new information regarding pt

   pneumonitis (although initial CXR do not suggest this) and failure to
   improve on abxs alone.

   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic

   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- consider haldol or morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with controlled rate.  Consider HF as a trigger given
   significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p diltiazem gtt for
   rate control.
   -- Cont Metoprolol 25mg tid
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none now

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a cardiac history and squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, respiratory failure, constipation, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, pleural effusion, and hypernatremia. He is currently receiving various medications and treatments for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: The patient's pneumonia appears to be severe and has spread to multiple lobes of the lung. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be carefully managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Pleural Effusion: The presence of a pleural effusion can compromise lung function and may require drainage or other interventions.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be corrected to prevent further complications, such as neurological issues.
5. Constipation: The patient's constipation should be addressed to prevent complications like impaction or bowel obstruction.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may require close monitoring and additional interventions to ensure his safety and well-being.
7. End-of-Life Care: Given the patient's age and tenuous health status,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and right ventricular overload. He is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by left-sided pneumonia. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to the left-sided pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and treatment with antibiotics are ongoing.

2. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient has constipation, for which FOS (likely referring to a laxative) has been prescribed.

3. Pneumonia, Other: Besides the left-sided pneumonia, there is mention of ""other pneumonia"" which may indicate a potential risk of developing additional pulmonary infections.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is described as waxing and waning, indicating possible delirium or confusion. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.

5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which could contribute to cardiac complications such as thromboembolism or arrhythmias.

6. Pleural Effusion, Acute: There is mention of an acute pleural effusion, which may require further evaluation and management to prevent complications such as infection or tension pneumothorax.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, indicating an imbalance in sodium levels."

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,

   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime complete on
   [**1-9**], Vanc complete on [**1-15**]); (vanco trough appropriate on [**1-6**], so
   continue dosing)
   -- Continue Methylprednisolone 40mg IV x 5 days, given daily in the AM
   ([**Date range (1) 11169**]), given new information regarding pt
s ? chemical
   pneumonitis (although initial CXR
s do not suggest this) and failure to
   drastically improve on antibiotics alone.
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-7**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Given bradycardia (or heart rates at lower limit of normal)
   currently, closely monitor BP and MS to ensure patient is tolerating
   the lower HR
   -- Cont Metoprolol 25mg tid, with hold parameters
   -- Hold dilt gtt for now, consider restart prn if RVR re-occurs
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none today
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on PO flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Resolved. Na today 145. s/p D5W resuscitation. No IVF
   or lasix today.
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   - Glasses
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed early in hospital course, f/u recs if any
   placed
   .
   Less Active Issues
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: The patient has a unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrate and a history of smoking, which suggests a possible post-obstructive pneumonia. The presence of pink frothy sputum production and white-out of the left lung raises concerns about a pleural effusion.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient exhibits pedal edema, rapid weight gain, and elevated BNP levels, indicating acute-on-chronic CHF. The patient's age and tenuous health status make it difficult to assess fluid status accurately.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has experienced episodes of AFIB with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Rate control is necessary to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient had an elevated sodium level of 145 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia. This condition requires careful monitoring and management.

5. Agitation/Disorientation: The patient becomes agitated when SpO2 decreases. This requires reorientation and consideration of sedation if necessary.

6. Colonization/C. difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, increasing the risk of C. difficile infection. Prophylactic treatment with Flagyl has been initiated.

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime complete on
   [**1-9**], Vanc complete on [**1-15**]); (vanco trough appropriate on [**1-6**], so
   continue dosing)
   -- Continue Methylprednisolone 40mg IV x 5 days, given daily in the AM
   ([**Date range (1) 11169**]), given new information regarding pt
s ? chemical
   pneumonitis (although initial CXR
s do not suggest this) and failure to
   drastically improve on antibiotics alone.
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-7**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB and anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead.
   -- Given bradycardia, closely monitor BP and MS to ensure patient is
   tolerating the lower HR
   -- Cont Metoprolol 25mg tid, with hold parameters
   -- Hold dilt gtt for now, consider restart prn if RVR re-occurs
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none today
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on PO flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Resolved. Na today 145. s/p D5W resuscitation.
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed early in hospital course, f/u recs
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Hold on diuresis today
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and white-out of the left lung. The patient also has a smoking history.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and later diagnosed as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He was initially treated with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for CAP, but the treatment was discontinued and switched to vancomycin and cefepime for HAP.

The patient's respiratory status is unstable, as evidenced by his low oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels. He requires non-invasive ventilation but had an episode where he stopped ventilator support. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which was initially controlled but then resulted in bradycardia.

The patient has pedal edema and rapid weight gain, indicating possible heart failure (HF). His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, suggesting acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, fluid status is difficult to assess due to the patient's tenuous health.

The patient also has a history of constipation, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), agitation/disorientation, and a recent Clostrid"

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and requires high-flow oxygen. If not managed properly, there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multilobar pneumonia, which increases the risk of complications such as sepsis and organ failure if not treated effectively.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and it may continue to be a concern during"

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,

   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime complete on
   [**1-9**], Vanc complete on [**1-15**])
   -- Check AM Vanco level
   -- Continue Methylprednisolone 40mg IV x 5 days, given daily in the AM
   ([**Date range (1) 11169**]), given new information regarding pt
s ? chemical
   pneumonitis (although initial CXR
s do not suggest this) and failure to
   drastically improve on antibiotics alone.
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-9**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Given bradycardia (or heart rates at lower limit of normal)
   currently, closely monitor BP and MS to ensure patient is tolerating
   the lower HR
   -- Switched Metoprolol from 25mg PO TID to 7.5mg IV Q5hr, given nursing
   concerns about pt
s ability to take PO
   -- Hold dilt gtt for now, consider consider restarting prn if RVR
   re-occurs
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none today
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on IV flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Na today 149.
   - Today
s free water deficit 2.3L, will give pt D5 a 120 mL/hr x 2L.
   - PM lytes
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   - Glasses
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed early in hospital course, f/u recs if any
   placed
   .
   Less Active Issues
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Hold on diuresis today
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema

   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime complete on
   [**1-9**], Vanc complete on [**1-15**]); (vanco trough appropriate on [**1-6**], so
   continue dosing)
   -- Continue Methylprednisolone 40mg IV x 5 days, given daily in the AM
   ([**Date range (1) 11169**]), given new information regarding pt
s ? chemical
   pneumonitis (although initial CXR
s do not suggest this) and failure to

   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Given bradycardia (or heart rates at lower limit of normal)
   currently, closely monitor BP and MS to ensure patient is tolerating
   the lower HR
   -- Switched Metoprolol from 25mg PO TID to 7.5mg IV Q5hr, given nursing
   concerns about pt
s ability to take PO
   -- Hold dilt gtt for now, consider consider restarting prn if RVR

   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a cardiac history and squamous cell carcinoma on his face, admitted for shortness of breath, chest pain, and white-out of the left lung. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation, and a pleural effusion. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been treated with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is also receiving methylprednisolone for suspected chemical pneumonitis and has been started on flagyl for a C. difficile infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 140/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. His lab results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and hypernatremia. Imaging reveals multifocal consolidations in the lungs, most likely due to pneumonia, and a small left pleural effusion. The patient's current plan includes continuing the antibiotics, monitoring fluid status, and providing supportive care.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a diagnosis of pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can progress and lead to sepsis or respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress could worsen if his oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with severe pneumonia involving the entire left lung, difficulties with atrial fibrillation (AFib), and possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has been managed with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) due to his do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status. Overnight, the patient experienced rapid AFib, for which intravenous (IV) lopressor was administered, resulting in a good heart rate response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has severe multifocal pneumonia involving the entire left lung. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and may require broad-spectrum antibiotics and empiric steroids. Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has had difficulties with AFib, and overnight, he experienced rapid AFib, which was controlled with IV lopressor. It is essential to maintain heart rate control to prevent complications such as hemodynamic instability or embolic events.

3. C. diff Infection: The patient may have a C. diff infection, for which he is receiving IV Flagyl. Proper infection control measures should be implemented to prevent the spread of C. diff within the ICU.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires careful management to prevent neurological complications. Administration of D"

   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals.
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime complete on
   [**1-9**], Vanc complete on [**1-15**])
   -- Check AM Vanco level
   -- Today ([**1-8**]) is the last day of Methylprednisolone 40mg IV x 5
   days, given daily in the AM ([**Date range (1) 11169**])
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin

   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Given bradycardia (or heart rates at lower limit of normal)
   currently, closely monitor BP and MS to ensure patient is tolerating
   the lower HR
   -- Switched Metoprolol from 25mg PO TID to 7.5mg IV Q5hr, given nursing
   concerns about pt
s ability to take PO
   -- Hold dilt gtt for now, consider consider restarting if RVR re-occurs
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none today
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.

   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 35.8°C, heart rate 70 bpm, blood pressure 141/53 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 90%. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute pleural effusion, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently on ventilatory support with high flow nasal cannula and receiving antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient also has a history of constipation, altered mental status, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation is at 90%, indicating possible respiratory distress. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary, and nebulizers should be continued as needed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and he is currently on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is crucial to ensure that the antibiotics are effective and to monitor the patient's response to the treatment.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure. Monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and maintaining rate control are"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, multiple focal pneumonia, respiratory distress, and other medical conditions. He is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and supportive care. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but he is experiencing respiratory distress. His lab results show some abnormalities, including elevated sodium levels, kidney function impairment, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's nutritional status is a concern, and he is also experiencing constipation and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and multifocal pneumonia put him at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support may be necessary.
2. Kidney Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment. It is crucial to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid and medication administration accordingly.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be managed carefully to prevent further complications such as dehydration or neurological issues.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation should be addressed promptly to avoid complications like fecal impaction or bowel perforation.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status should be closely monitored for signs of delirium or worsening confusion, which could indicate an underlying infection or metabolic disturbance.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's imm"

   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV x5days ([**1-4**] to [**1-8**]).
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime complete on
   [**1-9**], Vanc complete on [**1-15**])
   -- Today ([**1-8**]) is the last day of Methylprednisolone 40mg IV x 5
   days, given daily in the AM ([**Date range (1) 11169**])
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-9**])

   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Continue Metoprolol 7.5mg IV Q6hr, (IV form because of concern with
   swallowing pills), with hold parameters

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a cardiac history and squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has several medical complications, including pneumonia, respiratory distress, altered mental status (not delirium), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), pleural effusion, hypernatremia, and a possible Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's pneumonia appears to be multi-lobar and unilateral, which makes congestive heart failure less likely. However, there is evidence of volume overload. The patient also has a history of smoking, which raises the possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia. A thoracentesis was performed, and imaging showed a loculated pleural effusion. The patient refused video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for the effusion.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is uncontrolled, with rapid ventricular response. He has been on diltiazem and metoprolol for rate control, but his heart rate remains elevated. The patient's ejection fraction is decreased, and he has systolic and likely diastolic dysfunction.

The patient has hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 147. He will receive D5 at 120 mL/hr x 1.5L to correct the free water deficit of 1.7L.

The patient's end-of-life care is"

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV x5days ([**1-4**] to [**1-8**]).
   -- Continue Vanc/Cefepime for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime complete on
   [**1-9**], Vanc complete on [**1-15**])
   -- Today ([**1-8**]) is the last day of Methylprednisolone 40mg IV x 5
   days, given daily in the AM ([**Date range (1) 11169**])
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-9**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Continue Metoprolol 7.5mg IV Q6hr, (IV form because of concern with
   swallowing pills), with hold parameters
   -- Hold dilt gtt for now, consider consider restarting if RVR re-occurs
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none today
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Continue ASA 325mg daily
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on IV flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].

   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV x5days ([**1-4**] to [**1-8**]).
   -- Continue Vanc for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime completed on [**1-9**],
   Vanc completes on [**1-15**])
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-11**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Continue Metoprolol 7.5mg IV Q6hr, (IV form because of concern with
   swallowing pills), with hold parameters
   -- Hold dilt gtt for now, consider consider restarting if RVR re-occurs
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none today
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.

   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Hold on diuresis today

The patient's imaging results show a dense pneumonia and a loculated pleural effusion. The patient's ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has been treated with diltiazem and metoprolol.

The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, monitoring fluid status carefully, and using Lasix as needed to prevent flash pulmonary edema. The patient also needs to be monitored for agitation and disorientation, as well as hypernatremia. End-of-life care has been discussed, and the patient has chosen not to be intubated.

The patient's allergies include Percocet (oral) and Tylenol (oral). The patient's medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), metoprolol, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), morphine sulfate, and others.

The patient's progress note mentions several medical issues, including nutrition alteration, constipation, pneumonia, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and pleural effusion."

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV x5days ([**1-4**] to [**1-8**]).
   -- Continue Vanc for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime completed on [**1-9**],
   Vanc completes on [**1-15**])
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-11**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   -- Try shovel rather than facemask (with nasal cannula) for patient
   comfort
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Continue Metoprolol 7.5mg IV Q6hr, (IV form because of concern with
   swallowing pills), with hold parameters
   -- Hold dilt gtt for now, consider consider restarting if RVR re-occurs
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none today
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Holding ASA 325 given melanotic guiac positive stool on [**1-9**]
   .
   # Melanotic Guiac positive stool on [**1-9**]. Unclear if [**2-21**] c.diff versus
   more true GIB.
   -- check color of next stool
   -- guiac all stools
   -- check pm Hct today (Hct
s stable x2 thus far)
   -- Hold aspirin
   -- changed daily to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- check AM coags
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on IV flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Resolved.
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   - Glasses
   - Avoid restraints as possible
   - Keep oxygen delivery in place
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed early in hospital course, f/u recs if any
   placed
   .
   Less Active Issues
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Hold on diuresis today
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   # FEN:  PICC changed from single to double lumen today; start TPN
   through PICC today (f/u TPN recs from nutrition). Avoiding Dobhoff for
   now (given CPAP need and goals of care seem to hint away from NG tube).
   #. Access: PICC (double lumen).

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma of the face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient also has a melanotic guiac positive stool, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), a heart rate of 85 bpm, a blood pressure of 146/43 mmHg (67/32-162/106), a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles on the left side of the chest, trace bilateral edema, and no pain or distress.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but he has hypernatremia and elevated lactate levels. The cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction.

The patient's chest X-ray shows marked improvement in right opacities and unchanged left opacities. There is also a left pleural effusion present.

The patient's medical complications include pneumonia, respiratory distress, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and acute pleural effusion. The assessment"

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV x5days ([**1-4**] to [**1-8**]).
   -- Continue Vanc for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime completed on [**1-9**],
   Vanc completes on [**1-15**])
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-11**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic.
   Holding diuresis for now.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   -- Try shovel rather than facemask (with nasal cannula) for patient
   comfort
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Continue Metoprolol 7.5mg IV Q6hr, (IV form because of pt difficulty
   swallowing pills), with hold parameters
   -- Diuresis with Lasix prn, none today
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Holding ASA 325 given melanotic guiac positive stool on [**1-9**]
   .
   # Melanotic Guiac positive stool on [**1-9**]. Unclear if [**2-21**] c.diff versus
   more true GIB.  No more episodes of melena since.
   -- guiac all stools
   -- check pm Hct today (Hct
s stable x2 thus far)
   -- Hold aspirin
   -- changed daily to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- check AM coags
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on IV flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Wrote for 150cc/hr of D5 for 1500mLs this AM.
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   - Glasses
   - Avoid restraints as possible
   - Keep oxygen delivery in place
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed early in hospital course, f/u recs if any
   placed
   .
   Less Active Issues
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - Hold on diuresis today
   - Monitor I/O to ensure patient does not go into fluid overload & go
   into flash pulmonary edema
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   # FEN:  PICC changed from single to double lumen today; pt on TPN
   through PICC today (f/u TPN recs from nutrition). Avoiding Dobhoff for
   now (as pt would likely remove Dobhoff in his delirium and additionally
   it would interfere with face mask fit).
   #. Access: PICC (double lumen).
   #. PPX: home PPI given [**Hospital1 **] now, SQH, bowel regimen (PRN given known c.
   diff infection)
   #. CONTACT: with patient, and friends who are [**Name (NI) 11045**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 484**] and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11046**]), last updated [**1-7**]
   #. CODE: DNR/DNI.
   #. DISPO: In ICU, pending improvement of respiratory status, PT consult
   placed.
","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a cardiac history and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and white out of the left lung. 

The patient has multi-focal pneumonia and respiratory distress. He is on Vanc/Cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). His oxygen saturation (SpO2) decreases when he becomes anxious or removes his oxygen mask. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which was initially controlled but then developed bradycardia after receiving diltiazem. Metoprolol was given IV and orally to control heart rate, and the patient responded well. 

The patient also has hypernatremia, agitation/disorientation, possible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), constipation, acute diastolic and systolic heart failure, and a positive melanotic guaiac stool test. 

The patient's current medications include Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis), Pantoprazole (Protonix), Morphine Sulfate, and other ICU medications. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. His blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 175/75 mmHg to 112/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 83%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals trace edema bilaterally, multiple squamous cell carcinoma lesions, and soft abdomen. 

The patient's imaging and microbiology results are pending. 

The patient's plan includes continuing Vanc for HAP, monitoring fluid status carefully, administering Nebulizers as needed, and considering BiPAP as needed. The patient has declined intubation. 

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU pending improvement of respiratory status."

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV x5days ([**1-4**] to [**1-8**]).
   -- Continue Vanc for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime completed on [**1-9**],
   Vanc completes on [**1-15**])
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-11**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic. Will
   give Lasix 20mg IV today ([**1-11**]), with PM lytes and I&O check.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   -- Try shovel rather than facemask (with nasal cannula) for patient
   comfort
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Continue Metoprolol 7.5mg IV Q6hr, (IV form because of pt difficulty
   swallowing pills), with hold parameters
   -- Diuresis with Lasix today, as noted above
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Holding ASA 325 given melanotic guiac positive stool on [**1-9**]
   .
   # Melanotic Guiac positive stool on [**1-9**]. Unclear if [**2-21**] c.diff versus
   more true GIB.  No more episodes of melena since.
   -- guiac all stools
   -- check pm Hct today
   -- Hold aspirin
   -- changed daily to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- following AM coags
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on IV flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to pt
s poor PO intake over last week.
   Wrote for 150cc/hr of D5 for 1500mLs this AM.  Also starting TPN
   today.  Will check PM Na.
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   - Glasses
   - Avoid restraints as possible
   - Keep oxygen delivery in place
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed early in hospital course, f/u recs if any
   placed
   .
   Less Active Issues
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV today as noted above ([**1-11**]).
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   # FEN:  will start TPN through PICC today ([**1-11**]); f/u TPN recs from
   nutrition. Avoiding Dobhoff for now (as pt would likely remove Dobhoff
   in his delirium and additionally it would interfere with face mask
   fit).
   #. Access: PICC (double lumen).
   #. PPX: home PPI given [**Hospital1 **], SQH, bowel regimen (PRN given known c. diff
   infection)
   #. CONTACT: with patient, and friends who are [**Name (NI) 11045**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 484**] and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11046**]), last updated [**1-7**]

   weeks).
","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath and pink frothy sputum production for three days.

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV x5days ([**1-4**] to [**1-8**]).
   -- Continue Vanc for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime completed on [**1-9**],
   Vanc completes on [**1-15**])
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-11**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Given [**Hospital1 **]-v hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic
   dysfunction, monitor fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not
   go into flash pulmonary edema; lasix prn to keep pt in euvolemic. Will
   give Lasix 20mg IV today ([**1-11**]), with PM lytes and I&O check.
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   -- Try shovel rather than facemask (with nasal cannula) for patient
   comfort
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Continue Metoprolol 7.5mg IV Q6hr, (IV form because of pt difficulty
   swallowing pills), with hold parameters
   -- Diuresis with Lasix today, as noted above
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Holding ASA 325 given melanotic guiac positive stool on [**1-9**]
   .
   # Melanotic Guiac positive stool on [**1-9**]. Unclear if [**2-21**] c.diff versus
   more true GIB.  No more episodes of melena since.
   -- guiac all stools
   -- check pm Hct today
   -- Hold aspirin
   -- changed daily to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -- following AM coags
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on IV flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to pt
s poor PO intake over last week.
   Wrote for 150cc/hr of D5 for 1500mLs this AM.  Also starting TPN
   today.  Will check PM Na.
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   - Glasses
   - Avoid restraints as possible
   - Keep oxygen delivery in place
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed early in hospital course, f/u recs if any
   placed
   .
   Less Active Issues
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV today as noted above ([**1-11**]).
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   # FEN:  will start TPN through PICC today ([**1-11**]); f/u TPN recs from
   nutrition. Avoiding Dobhoff for now (as pt would likely remove Dobhoff
   in his delirium and additionally it would interfere with face mask
   fit).
   #. Access: PICC (double lumen).
   #. PPX: home PPI given [**Hospital1 **], SQH, bowel regimen (PRN given known c. diff
   infection)
   #. CONTACT: with patient, and friends who are [**Name (NI) 11045**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 484**] and
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11046**]), last updated [**1-7**]
   #. CODE: DNR/DNI.
   #. DISPo: will see if pt can go to rehab today (has had one for several
   weeks).
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on his face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and pink frothy sputum production. The patient also has a smoking history.

The patient's current condition includes pneumonia with respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation (AFib), pleural effusion, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF). The pneumonia is described as dense and multi-lobar, affecting the whole lung. The pleural effusion is loculated, and there is a concern for post-obstructive pneumonia due to the patient's smoking history and previous normal physical examination.

The patient has been on various medications, including antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as well as diuretics for fluid management. He has also been given steroids for his squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypoxia, and potential signs of fluid overload. His laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is severe and requires aggressive treatment. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and potential sepsis.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's"

   24 Hour Events:
   - plan for d/c to rehab today ([**1-12**])
   - questions for d/c: ?should be on an ACE or [**Last Name (un) 239**]? (based on echo); when
   to resume ASA? (was taken off of it in setting of melena on [**1-9**])
   came in on Lasix 40 mg QD and Lisinopril 10 mg QD
   - 20 lasix given yesterday ([**1-11**])
   - TPN started
   - afib with RVR to 130s; 10 metoprolol given; then gave 10mg dilt IV,
   and pt responded with HR in 90s.
   - this morning, start 1.5L D5W at 120cc/hour to correct his hyperNa
   - Respiratory status: somewhat worse today. Although the pt was
   maintained on 4L NC with O2sats 88-96% for most of last yesterday,
   overnight he had to be placed on 35% shovel face mask w. 4L NC.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on his face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, pink frothy sputum production, and whiteout of the left lung. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, respiratory distress, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition includes worsening respiratory status, requiring an increased level of oxygen support and the use of nebulizers. He has crackles at the bases bilaterally and is showing signs of fluid overload. The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia due to poor oral intake. He is also experiencing agitation and disorientation, particularly when his oxygen saturation decreases.

The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, and his B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, suggesting acute-on-chronic heart failure. However, fluid status assessment is challenging in this patient. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by increased creatinine levels.

The patient has been prescribed multiple medications, including diuretics (Lasix), antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime), and anticoagulants. His home medications include montelukast, fluticasone, and cobivent. The patient has also been started on TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

Given the patient's tenuous health and advanced age, there have"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU and is planned to go to rehab today. The patient's condition has shown some improvement, but there are still several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is worsening, which may be due to fluid overload. Aggressive diuresis will be attempted to manage this issue.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's AFib responded to diltiazem treatment. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and adjust medication as needed.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which requires appropriate antibiotic therapy and respiratory support.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an acute pleural effusion, which may contribute to respiratory distress. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which needs to be closely monitored. It is important to rule out delirium and provide appropriate care.
6. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which should be managed with stool softeners such as fosaprepitant.
7. Poor Prognosis: The overall prognosis for the patient is poor, but there is a possibility of leaving the ICU today.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information."

   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of

   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV x5days ([**1-4**] to [**1-8**]). Given [**Hospital1 **]-v
   hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic dysfunction, monitor
   fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not go into flash
   pulmonary edema.
   -- Improved respiratory status today. Will try to wean patient from
   shovel mask to nasal cannula.  Hold on diuresis today.
   -- Continue Vanc for HAP, 14 day course (cefepime completed on [**1-9**],
   Vanc completes on [**1-15**])
   -- CXR every other day (next on [**1-13**])
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed for respiratory decompensation
   -- Cont home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s.
   -- Telemetry
   -- Continue Metoprolol 7.5mg IV Q6hr, (IV form because of pt difficulty
   swallowing pills), with hold parameters
   -- Hold on diuresis today.
   -- Not on anticoagulation for fall risk and ? GIB hx.
   -- Holding ASA 325 given melanotic guiac positive stool on [**1-9**],
   re-start [**1-17**].
   .
   # Melanotic Guiac positive stool on [**1-9**]. Unclear if [**2-21**] c.diff versus
   more true GIB.  No more episodes of melena since.
   -- check daily CBC, coags
   -- Holding aspirin for 7 days, can restart on [**1-17**].
   -- changed daily to [**Hospital1 **] PPI, can change back to Qday PPI on [**1-17**].
   .
   # C. diff infection
   - Started on IV flagyl [**1-2**] = day 1, pt will need 14 day course from
   the last day of his abx course for PNA (vanc/cefepime); d/c on [**2204-1-23**].
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to pt
s poor PO intake over last week, and
   improved today. Continuing D5 prn and pt also receiving TPN.  Will
   check PM Na.
   .
   # Agitation/Disorientation: Patient agitated when SpO2 decreases.
   - Consider haldol or morphine as needed for agitation as that was
   previously related to desats
   - Reorient frequently
   - Glasses
   - Avoid restraints as possible
   - Keep oxygen delivery in place
   .
   # End of life care:
   - Palliative care c/s placed early in hospital course, f/u recs if any
   placed
   .
   Less Active Issues
   #. Systolic and likely diastolic HF:  Given BNP >[**Numeric Identifier 11043**], weight gain,
   pitting edema b/l, and elevated Cr, patient appears he is in acute on
   chronic HF, though fluid status is difficult to assess in this
   patient.  Given patient
s age and tenuous health, hold Lasix diuresis
   today and instead attempt to rate control a fib with RVR to increase
   forward flow and promote auto-diuresis.
   - monitor I/Os today, maintain euvolemia
   - held pt
s home lisinopril due to, initially ARF then later due to
   pt
s difficulty taking PO. Can be restarted by pt
s PCP as an
   [**Name9 (PRE) 11227**].
   .
   #. DIABETES:
   -- will hold home PO meds; on SSI
   .
   # FEN:  TPN, f/u recs from nutrition. Avoiding Dobhoff for now (as pt
   would likely remove Dobhoff in his delirium and additionally it would
   interfere with face mask fit).
   #. Access: PICC (double lumen).
   #. PPX: IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], SQH, bowel regimen (plan for dulcolax today).
   #. CONTACT: with patient, and friends who are [**Name (NI) 11045**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 484**] and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a cardiac history and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. He was admitted with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and pink frothy sputum production. The patient also has a smoking history.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: The patient has a unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrate, likely due to parapneumonic effusion or post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient initially received azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia but was switched to vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status improved, and he is being weaned from the shovel mask to a nasal cannula. CXR will be taken every other day.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is agitated when SpO2 decreases. Haldol or morphine may be considered for agitation as previously related to desats. Reorientation is recommended, and oxygen delivery should be maintained.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has AFIB with rapid ventricular response. Metoprolol was initially used for rate control, but the patient developed bradycardia. The patient responded well to IV metoprolol and resumed his oral dose of metoprolol 25mg. Telemetry monitoring is advised.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a cardiac history and squamous cell carcinoma on his face. He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and pink frothy sputum production. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, respiratory distress, and pleural effusion. He also has atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and a positive guaiac test indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently on various medications including diuretics, antibiotics, and antiarrhythmics. His condition has been improving, but he still requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and pink frothy sputum production suggest pneumonia. The presence of a unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrate on imaging further supports this diagnosis. The patient's smoking history and the possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia should be considered. Monitoring oxygen saturation and maintaining adequate oxygen delivery is crucial to prevent hypoxia.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has evidence of a loculated pleural effusion. If the effusion does not resolve or recurs, intervention such as thoracentesis or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) may be necessary to drain the fluid and obtain a diagnosis.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o male with cardiac history as well as squamous cell CA on face,
   admitted with SOB/DOE x 3 days w/ pink frothy sputum production and
   white out of left lung.
   .
   #. Pneumonia/Respiratory distress: Patient with unilateral multi-lobar
   pulmonary infiltrate. Less likely CHF b/c of unilateral nature, though
   appears to have element of volume overload; parapneumonic effusion most
   likely, and would consider post-obstructive PNA given degree to which
   whole lung is affect and smoking history (thought had a normal PE four
   days ago at PCP's office per the pt).  Also with question of
   hemotpysis, making mass and PE a possibility (especially with the
   hypoxia).  S/p thoracentesis with CT imaging , initially believed to
   show loculated pleural effusion, final read pending.  TTE showed no
   pleural effusion or aortic stenosis, but did show new [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   hypokinesis.  IP evaluated patient and recommended VATS for loculated
   pleural effusion, which the patient refused.  His CT shows a dense
   pneumonia. Patient was initially on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for empiric
   treatment of CAP, but this was d/c
ed [**12-26**] and patient was started on
   Vanc/Cefepime for HAP. When patient becomes anxious or removes his O2
   mask, SpO2 decreases. The patient is s/p 5 day course of azithromycin
   (finished [**12-30**]) for coverage of atypicals. s/p 5-day course of
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV x5days ([**1-4**] to [**1-8**]). Given [**Hospital1 **]-v
   hypokinesis and likely diastolic and systolic dysfunction, monitor
   fluid status carefully to ensure patient does not go into flash
   pulmonary edema.
   -- Improved respiratory status today. Hold on CPAP/BiPAP. Will try to
   wean patient down further on nasal cannula. Goal SpO2 in low 90s.
   -- Incentive spirometer
   -- Cr bumped, so hold on diuresis today (plus requiring less O2)
   -- s/p 14-day course of treatment for HAP (cefepime completed on [**1-9**],
   Vanc completed on [**1-15**])
   -- CXR every other day -  next = [**1-16**]
   -- Nebs standing and prn
   -- Consider haldol or morphine for SOB & anxiety prn 1-2mg IV q4h
   -- BiPAP as needed for respiratory decompensation
   -- Not taking [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] d/c
d home montelukast, fluticasone, cobivent
   -- If spikes, can add levofloxacin
   -- Patient does not wish to be intubated
   -- Avoid PO d/t aspiration risk
   .
   #. AFIB:  In afib with originally controlled rate.  Consider HF as a
   trigger given significant pedal edema and rapid weight gain. s/p
   diltiazem gtt for rate control early in hospital course. Afib with RVR
   again on evening of [**1-5**]
 dilt gtt resulted in resolution of RVR but
   into bradycardia instead. Overnight on [**1-6**], pt again had A. fib w.
   rates in 130s, in the setting of having his metoprolol held x 3 doses.
   Pt responded to Metoprolol 5mg IV x2, and his PO dose of metop 25mg,
   with heart rate in the 60-70s. Without RVR
 rate well-controlled
   recently.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of cardiac issues and squamous cell carcinoma on the face. They were admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, coughing up pink frothy sputum, and white out of the left lung. The patient has a unilateral multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrate, which could indicate pneumonia or a parapneumonic effusion. There is also a possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia due to the patient's smoking history. The presence of hypoxia raises concerns about a possible mass or pulmonary embolism.

2. Heart Failure (HF): The patient has evidence of systolic and likely diastolic HF, as indicated by pedal edema, rapid weight gain, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and elevated creatinine. The patient's age and tenuous health status make managing HF challenging.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). They required diltiazem for rate control but developed bradycardia. Metoprolol was used to control heart rate, but it was initially held due to difficulty swallowing pills. The patient's AFIB is currently being managed with metoprolol IV and PO.
