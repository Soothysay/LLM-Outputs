   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 53 year-old male with a history of relapsing
   refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab and HCV cirrhosis who
   presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever/Hypotension - Concern for septic picture as he was febrile in
   the ED and now his BP has been refractory to IVF. Lactate 3.0.
   Currently on levophed. Source at this point is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1490**] altered
   mental status, meningitis is on the differential. Other possible
   infectious sources include SBP, pneumonia (though has not been notably
   hypoxic and no significant infiltrates on chest imaging), or line
   infection from his PICC. He is also on chronic steroids, so adrenal
   insufficiency is likely playing a role.
   - continue vanco, ceftriaxone, acyclovir ([**12-6**]) for empiric meningitis
   coverage
   - Contine levofloxacin ([**12-6**]) to double cover for gram negatives,
   including pseudomonas
   - stress dose steroids given on chronic prednisone
   - Plan to d/c PICC line
   - replace arterial line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12; Plan to use LR for bolus instead of NS
   given acidosis and d5w with 3 amp bicarb
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if to maintain goal MAP > 65 and UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - If still hypotensive at 1200, will add Vasopressin to help decrease
   dose of levophed
   - Follow-up blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count/ANC and fever curve
   .
   # Acidosis
 Mixed NaG and ag. Likely [**2-1**] lactic acidosis and NS volume
   resusication. Elevated lactate to 5.3 from 2.3 yesterday. Likely
   consistent with sepsis and hypotesion.
   -trend lactate
   -repeat abg
   -Consider increased RR on vent
   - transition to LR IVF
   -consider bicarb if ph < 7.1
   .
   # Elevated LFTs
 Could be [**2-1**] shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, cholangitis (fever, jaundice, ?RUQ pain), or hepatitis [**2-1**]
   virus or EtOh.
   -Abd u/s to evaluate for choleducholethiasis, cbd dilistation,
   cholecysititis  as well as ascites
   -Ggt to determine source of alk phos elevation
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 No ECG changes consistent with hyperkalemia. Cr
   elevated from 0.6 to 1 so could be consistent with ARF.
   - repeat K now
   -Kayexelate
   -serial ECGs
   -If ECG changes, consider CaGlucoate, Albuterol, Insulin with D50
   .
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**2-1**] to underlying malignancy and chemotherapy.
   Appears to be in blast crisis. Given blood in Foley, plan to transfuse
   platetlets.
   -Transfuse platelets
   -Check central venous oxygen sat; if less than 70 plan to transfuse for
   Hct > 30, otherwise transfusion threshold 21
   -trend cbc
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely delirium secondary to infection. Could
   also be secondary to meningitis, or represent CNS involvement of his
   lymphoma. He is intubated for airway protection. Now unable to assess
   given sedation.
   - LP deferred currently given low platelet count but covering
   empirically for meningitis
   - treating possible infection as above
   .
   # Respiratory: Intubated for airway protection. Currently on pressure
   support but tachypneic to 40s. Post-intubation CXR with question of ET
   tube position being too high. Changes to ventilator on rounds include
   fio2 to 50 from 60 and changed to pressure support ventilation to
   increase synch with vent.
   - Continue pressure support
   - Wean oxygen to subtoxic levels
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   # Urinary retention: Likely secondary to urethral stricture. Bladder
   scan revealed 763cc urine which was voided s/p placement of foley by
   urology.
   - cont to monitor UOP
   .
   # ALL: Refractory, currently on palliative prednisone and rituximab.
   Blast count is rising at 48 today, suggesting progression of his
   disease.
   - stress dose steroids as above
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   # DM: Steroid-induced on lantus and sliding scale at home.
   - Insulin gtt for better coverage
   - adjust dosage prn
   .
   # Pain/opioid dependence
 On methadone at home, but plan to hold this
   while LFTs elevated.
   - Continue fentanyl drip for sedation
   .
   # FEN:
   -IVF as above
   -NPO for now; s/p OG tube placement -

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab, as well as HCV cirrhosis. He presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is on mechanical ventilation. He has a central line, arterial line, and PICC line in place. His vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient's laboratory results indicate pancytopenia, hyperkalemia, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. He has an elevated lactate level, suggesting possible sepsis or lactic acidosis. His urine output is low, and he has a Foley catheter in place.

The plan of care includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis, stress dose steroids, and covering for meningitis empirically. The patient's fluid status should be optimized, and he may require vasopressor support. Liver function tests should be trended, and an abdominal ultrasound is planned to assess for potential causes of liver dysfunction. Hyperkalemia should be managed appropriately, and the patient's platelet count should be monitored closely.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case. These may include worsening sepsis leading to multiple organ dysfunction, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), worsening liver dysfunction,"

   # Acidosis
 Mixed NaG and ag. Likely [**2-1**] lactic acidosis and NS volume
   resusication. Elevated lactate to 5.3 from 2.3 yesterday. Likely
   consistent with sepsis and hypotesion.
   -trend lactate
   -repeat abg
   -Consider increased RR on vent
   - transition to LR IVF
   -consider bicarb if ph < 7.1
   .
   # Elevated LFTs
 Could be [**2-1**] shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, cholangitis (fever, jaundice, ?RUQ pain), or hepatitis [**2-1**]
   virus or EtOh.
   -Abd u/s to evaluate for choleducholethiasis, cbd dilistation,
   cholecysititis  as well as ascites
   -Ggt to determine source of alk phos elevation
   - trend LFTs

   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**2-1**] to underlying malignancy and chemotherapy.
   Appears to be in blast crisis. Given blood in Foley, plan to transfuse
   platetlets.
   -Transfuse platelets
   -Check central venous oxygen sat; if less than 70 plan to transfuse for
   Hct > 30, otherwise transfusion threshold 21
   -trend cbc
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely delirium secondary to infection. Could
   also be secondary to meningitis, or represent CNS involvement of his
   lymphoma. He is intubated for airway protection. Now unable to assess
   given sedation.
   - LP deferred currently given low platelet count but covering
   empirically for meningitis
   - treating possible infection as above
   .
   # Respiratory: Intubated for airway protection. Currently on pressure
   support but tachypneic to 40s. Post-intubation CXR with question of ET
   tube position being too high. Changes to ventilator on rounds include
   fio2 to 50 from 60 and changed to pressure support ventilation to
   increase synch with vent.
   - Continue pressure support
   - Wean oxygen to subtoxic levels
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   # Urinary retention: Likely secondary to urethral stricture. Bladder
   scan revealed 763cc urine which was voided s/p placement of foley by
   urology.
   - cont to monitor UOP

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on prednisone and rituximab, as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has been febrile in the emergency department and now his blood pressure has been refractory to intravenous fluids. The patient is also on chronic steroids, so adrenal insufficiency is likely playing a role.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications. He has a fever and hypotension, which could be indicative of sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, but possible sources include meningitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pneumonia, or a line infection from his peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient is also on chronic steroids, making adrenal insufficiency a possible contributing factor.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, platelet count of 207"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 53 year-old male with a history of relapsing
   refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab and HCV cirrhosis who
   presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever/Hypotension - Concern for septic picture as he was febrile in
   the ED and now his BP has been refractory to IVF. Lactate 3.0.
   Currently on levophed. Source at this point is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1490**] altered
   mental status, meningitis is on the differential. Other possible
   infectious sources include SBP, pneumonia (though has not been notably
   hypoxic and no significant infiltrates on chest imaging), or line
   infection from his PICC. He is also on chronic steroids, so adrenal
   insufficiency is likely playing a role.
   - continue vanco, ceftriaxone, acyclovir for empiric meningitis
   coverage
   - Contine levofloxacin to double cover for gram negatives, including
   pseudomonas
   - stress dose steroids given on chronic prednisone
   - Plan to d/c PICC line
   - replace arterial line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if to maintain goal MAP > 65 and UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count/ANC and fever curve
   .
   # Acidosis
 [**2-1**] lactic acidosis. Elevated lactate to 5.3 from 2.3
   yesterday. Likely consistent with sepsis and hypotesion.
   -trend lactate

 No ECG changes consistent with hyperkalemia. Cr
   elevated from 0.6 to 1 so could be consistent with ARF.
   -Kayexelate
   -serial ECGs
   -If ECG changes, consider CaGlucoate, Albuterol, Insulin with D50

   # Altered mental status: Likely delirium secondary to infection. Could
   also be secondary to meningitis, or represent CNS involvement of his
   lymphoma. He is intubated for airway protection. Now unable to assess

   support but tachypneic to 40s. Post-intubation CXR with question of ET
   tube position being too high.
   - will clarify with ED whether ET tube was re-positioned
   - repeat CXR and reposition if needed
   - wean vent as able

   appears to be holding in mid-90's. Patient switched from assist control

   at this time.
   Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia. Patient to have

   Acidosis a combination of anion gap from lactic acid and non-gap
   acidosis from volume resuscitation with normal saline. Will give next
   liter of fluid as D5W  with bicarbonate since compensation for the
   acidosis requires excessive ventilation. Avoid lactated Ringers until
   potassium corrected.
   Patient's BP is improving, although still requiring levophed. CVP
   suggests still somewhat undervolume resuscitated (given PEEP of 8).
   Will continue fluids and wean off pressors. Consider adding

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), pneumonia, acidosis, and anemia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia, and has been sedated and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition suggests the possibility of ARDS due to the hypoxemic respiratory failure and increased dead space. ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs.

2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status may indicate septic shock, which can occur as a result of severe infection leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, suggesting potential liver dysfunction. This could be related to the patient's underlying leukemia or other factors.

4. Bleeding Disorder: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Given the patient's leukemia, this is a common complication.

5. Kidney Dysfunction: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. This can be caused by decreased blood flow to the kidneys or other factors.

6. Malnutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), which means"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 53 year-old male with a history of relapsing
   refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab and HCV cirrhosis who
   presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever/Hypotension - Concern for septic picture as he was febrile in
   the ED and now his BP has been refractory to IVF. Lactate 3.0.
   Currently on levophed. Source at this point is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1490**] altered
   mental status, meningitis is on the differential. Other possible
   infectious sources include SBP, pneumonia (though has not been notably
   hypoxic and no significant infiltrates on chest imaging), or line
   infection from his PICC. He is also on chronic steroids, so adrenal
   insufficiency is likely playing a role.
   - continue vanco, ceftriaxone, acyclovir ([**12-6**]) for empiric meningitis
   coverage
   - Contine levofloxacin ([**12-6**]) to double cover for gram negatives,
   including pseudomonas
   - stress dose steroids given on chronic prednisone
   - Plan to d/c PICC line
   - replace arterial line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12; Plan to use LR for bolus instead of NS
   given acidosis and d5w with 3 amp bicarb
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if to maintain goal MAP > 65 and UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - If still hypotensive at 1200, will add Vasopressin to help decrease
   dose of levophed
   - Follow-up blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count/ANC and fever curve
   .
   # Acidosis
 Mixed NaG and ag. Likely [**2-1**] lactic acidosis and NS volume
   resusication. Elevated lactate to 5.3 from 2.3 yesterday. Likely
   consistent with sepsis and hypotesion.
   -trend lactate
   -repeat abg
   -Consider increased RR on vent
   - transition to LR IVF
   -consider bicarb if ph < 7.1
   .
   # Elevated LFTs
 Could be [**2-1**] shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, cholangitis (fever, jaundice, ?RUQ pain), or hepatitis [**2-1**]
   virus or EtOh.
   -Abd u/s to evaluate for choleducholethiasis, cbd dilistation,
   cholecysititis  as well as ascites
   -Ggt to determine source of alk phos elevation
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 No ECG changes consistent with hyperkalemia. Cr
   elevated from 0.6 to 1 so could be consistent with ARF.
   - repeat K now
   -Kayexelate
   -serial ECGs
   -If ECG changes, consider CaGlucoate, Albuterol, Insulin with D50
   .
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**2-1**] to underlying malignancy and chemotherapy.
   Appears to be in blast crisis. Given blood in Foley, plan to transfuse
   platetlets.
   -Transfuse platelets
   -Check central venous oxygen sat; if less than 70 plan to transfuse for
   Hct > 30, otherwise transfusion threshold 21
   -trend cbc
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely delirium secondary to infection. Could
   also be secondary to meningitis, or represent CNS involvement of his
   lymphoma. He is intubated for airway protection. Now unable to assess
   given sedation.
   - LP deferred currently given low platelet count but covering
   empirically for meningitis
   - treating possible infection as above
   .
   # Respiratory: Intubated for airway protection. Currently on pressure
   support but tachypneic to 40s. Post-intubation CXR with question of ET
   tube position being too high. Changes to ventilator on rounds include
   fio2 to 50 from 60 and changed to pressure support ventilation to
   increase synch with vent.
   - Continue pressure support
   - Wean oxygen to subtoxic levels
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   # Urinary retention: Likely secondary to urethral stricture. Bladder
   scan revealed 763cc urine which was voided s/p placement of foley by
   urology.
   - cont to monitor UOP
   .
   # ALL: Refractory, currently on palliative prednisone and rituximab.
   Blast count is rising at 48 today, suggesting progression of his
   disease.
   - stress dose steroids as above
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   # DM: Steroid-induced on lantus and sliding scale at home.
   - Insulin gtt for better coverage
   - adjust dosage prn
   .
   # Pain/opioid dependence
 On methadone at home, but plan to hold this
   while LFTs elevated.
   - Continue fentanyl drip for sedation
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), on prednisone and rituximab, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, possibly due to an infectious source such as meningitis, pneumonia, or a line infection. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient has several medical complications including acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, hyperkalemia, pancytopenia, altered mental status, respiratory distress, urinary retention, and diabetes mellitus. He is also opioid-dependent.

Plan:

1. Continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for empiric meningitis coverage.
2. Continue levofloxacin to cover gram-negative bacteria including pseudomonas.
3. Administer stress dose steroids due to chronic prednisone use.
4. Plan to disconnect PICC line and replace arterial line.
5. Maintain goal central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-12, using lactated Ringer's (LR) for fluid resuscitation instead of normal saline (NS) due to acidosis.
6. Administer IV fluids and levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 and urine"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on prednisone and rituximab, as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension, which are likely consistent with sepsis. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and plans for extubation and comfort measures only (CMO) later today in conjunction with oncology.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of sepsis, considering his fever, altered mental status, and refractory hypotension. Source control measures should be initiated, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered.

2. Meningitis: Given the altered mental status, meningitis is on the differential. Empiric coverage for meningitis should be continued, especially since the patient is on chronic steroids, making adrenal insufficiency a concern.

3. Pneumonia: Although the patient has not been notably hypoxic and no significant infiltrates on chest imaging, pneumonia should still be considered as a possible infectious source. Continued surveillance and follow-up are necessary.

4. Line infection: The patient had a PICC line, which has since been removed. However, line infections should still be considered, and appropriate cultures should be obtained.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on prednisone and rituximab, as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension, likely consistent with sepsis. The patient has made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and plans for extubation and comfort measures only (CMO) later today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension suggests sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, with differentials including meningitis, pneumonia, or line infection. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated.
2. Acidosis: The patient has a mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. Acidosis is likely due to lactic acidosis from sepsis and previous volume resuscitation. Monitoring lactate levels, repeating ABG, and considering bicarbonate administration if pH < 7.1.
3. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, which could be due to shock liver, cholangitis, or hepatitis virus infection. Further evaluation with abdominal ultrasound (U/S) and consideration of antiviral therapy if indicated.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia with a potassium level"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 53 year-old male with a history of relapsing
   refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab and HCV cirrhosis who
   presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension.
   Presentation likely consistent with sepsis. In conjunction with
   oncology, pt made DNR yesterday and plan for terminal wean later today
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever/Hypotension - Concern for septic picture as he was febrile in
   the ED and now his BP has been refractory to IVF. Lactate 3.0.
   Currently on levophed. Source at this point is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 1490**] altered
   mental status, meningitis is on the differential. Other possible
   infectious sources include SBP, pneumonia (though has not been notably
   hypoxic and no significant infiltrates on chest imaging), or line
   infection from his PICC. PICC line has since been removed. He is also
   on chronic steroids, so adrenal insufficiency is likely playing a role.
   - continue vanco, ceftriaxone, acyclovir ([**12-6**]) for empiric meningitis
   coverage
   - Contine levofloxacin ([**12-6**]) to double cover for gram negatives,
   including pseudomonas
   - stress dose steroids given on chronic prednisone
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12; Plan to use LR for bolus instead of NS
   given acidosis and d5w with 3 amp bicarb
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if to maintain goal MAP > 65 and UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count/ANC and fever curve
   .
   # Acidosis
 Mixed NaG and ag. Likely [**2-1**] lactic acidosis and NS volume
   resusication. AG today is 10. Lactate trending down from 5.3 to 4.9.
   -trend lactate
   -repeat abg
   - transition to LR IVF
   -consider bicarb if ph < 7.1
   .
   # Elevated LFTs
 Could be [**2-1**] shock liver in the setting of
   hypotension, cholangitis (fever, jaundice, ?RUQ pain), or hepatitis [**2-1**]
   virus or EtOh.
   -f/u Abd u/s
   .
   # LUE swelling
 U/s pending for venous thrombus
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
 No ECG changes consistent with hyperkalemia. Cr
   elevated from 0.6 to 1 so could be consistent with ARF. Received
   calcium gluconate and insulin yesterday. K today at 5.
   -Kayexelate for K > 5.5
   -serial ECGs
   -If ECG changes, consider CaGlucoate, Albuterol, Insulin with D50
   .
   #Pancytopenia: Likely [**2-1**] to underlying malignancy and chemotherapy.
   Appears to be in blast crisis. Given blood in Foley, plan to transfuse
   platetlets. Platelets improved to 24 from 14 on admission. Hct trending
   down from 26 > 24 > 19 > 16. Given bleeding, and increasing coags,
   likely component of DIC in setting of sepsis.
   -Transfuse platelets
   - Transfuse prbc
   -Check central venous oxygen sat; if less than 70 plan to transfuse for
   Hct > 30, otherwise transfusion threshold 21
   -trend cbc
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely delirium secondary to infection. Could
   also be secondary to meningitis, or represent CNS involvement of his
   lymphoma. He is intubated for airway protection. Now unable to assess
   given sedation.
   - LP deferred currently given low platelet count but covering
   empirically for meningitis
   - treating possible infection as above
   .
   # Respiratory: Intubated for airway protection. Currently on pressure
   support but tachypneic to 40s. Post-intubation CXR with question of ET
   tube position being too high. Changes to ventilator on rounds include
   fio2 to 50 from 60 and changed to pressure support ventilation to
   increase synch with vent.
   - Continue pressure support
   - Wean oxygen to subtoxic levels
   - fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   # Urinary retention: Likely secondary to urethral stricture. Bladder
   scan revealed 763cc urine which was voided s/p placement of foley by
   urology.
   - cont to monitor UOP
   .
   # ALL: Refractory, currently on palliative prednisone and rituximab.
   Blast count is rising at 48 today, suggesting progression of his
   disease.
   - stress dose steroids as above
   - f/u BMT recs
   .
   # DM: Steroid-induced on lantus and sliding scale at home.
   - Insulin gtt for better coverage
   - adjust dosage prn
   .
   # Pain/opioid dependence
 On methadone at home, but plan to hold this
   while LFTs elevated.
   - Continue fentanyl drip for sedation
   .
   # FEN:

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on prednisone and rituximab, as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension, which are likely consistent with sepsis. 

The patient has been made DNR (do not resuscitate) and the plan for terminal wean later today. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and on pressure support ventilation with FiO2 of 50%. He also has a Foley catheter in place due to urinary retention. 

The patient's labs show pancytopenia, likely secondary to underlying malignancy and chemotherapy. His coagulation profile indicates a possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with elevated lactate levels. His potassium is elevated at 5.2, and he has received Kayexalate for K > 5.5. 

The patient's respiratory status is a concern, with tachypnea to 40s and post-intubation chest X-ray showing possible endotracheal tube position being too high. 

Other concerns include altered mental status, likely delirium secondary to infection or possibly secondary to meningitis or CNS involvement of lymphoma. He has been empirically covered for meningitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with fever and altered mental status. They were made comfort measure only (CMO) and extubated. The patient's DIC labs showed elevated TBili at 5.1, LDH at [**Numeric Identifier 4203**] IU/L, and decreased fibrinogen at 463 mg/dL with a platelet count of 24. The patient has multiple medical issues including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cirrhosis of the liver, leukemia, septic shock, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/45 to 114/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 85%. The patient is receiving morphine sulfate infusion and various ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications. These may include worsening of ARDS leading to further respiratory failure, development of infections due to immunosuppression from septic shock and leukemia, hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis of the liver, bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and complications related to altered mental status such as falls or inability to protect their airway."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on prednisone and rituximab, as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension. The presentation is consistent with sepsis. The patient was made comfort measures only (CMO) and extubated yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension suggests the possibility of sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Organ dysfunction: Given the patient's history of HCV cirrhosis and ALL, there is a risk of organ dysfunction, particularly liver and kidney dysfunction. Monitoring of liver function tests (such as bilirubin, albumin, and transaminases) and renal function tests (such as creatinine) will be important.

3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low (24 platelets), indicating an increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding and appropriate management, such as transfusion of platelets, may be necessary.

4. Respiratory complications: The patient was"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), on prednisone and rituximab, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension, which are likely consistent with sepsis. The patient was made comfort measures only (CMO), extubated, and currently in the ICU.

Key findings and potential medical complications include:
- Fever and altered mental status: These symptoms suggest the possibility of an infection or sepsis.
- Hypotension: This indicates poor perfusion and could be a sign of septic shock.
- History of relapsing refractory ALL: The patient's underlying condition makes him immunocompromised, increasing the risk of infections.
- HCV cirrhosis: Liver disease can predispose the patient to complications such as coagulopathy and increased risk of infections.
- Low platelet count (15,000/mm3): This may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombocytopenia secondary to ALL or liver disease.
- Elevated lactate level (4.9 mmol/L): Elevated lactate can be a marker of tissue hypoperfusion and may suggest septic shock.
- Abnormal coagulation profile (PTT 36.5/INR 2.0): Indicates possible co"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of relapsing refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), on prednisone and rituximab, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He presents with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension. The presentation is consistent with sepsis. The patient was made comfort measures only (CMO) and extubated yesterday. He is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension suggests sepsis. This is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Organ Failure: Due to the severity of the patient's condition, there is a risk of organ failure, particularly in the context of pre-existing liver cirrhosis.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's recent extubation may put him at risk for respiratory distress, especially considering his altered mental status and compromised respiratory function.
4. Bleeding: The low platelet count (24) indicates an increased risk of bleeding. The patient's history of thrombocytopenia due to ALL treatment further compounds this risk.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to leukemia treatment and HCV cirrhosis increases the likelihood of infections. This necessitates close monitoring and prompt management of any suspected infections."
