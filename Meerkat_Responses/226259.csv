   infection (esp known foot infection), cardiac ischemia, insulinoma.
   Patient says he has been taking normal dose of home metformin and
   glipizide. Only recent medication change was that patient took Bactrim.
   Perhaps this interacted with home glipizide to increase levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic non-healing lower extremity ulcers, and recent hypoglycemia. He presents with persistent hypoglycemia, elevated INR, and worsening foot ulcer. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 169/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals diaphoresis, regular rhythm with normal rate, decreased breath sounds at bases, bilateral lower extremity edema, and foot ulceration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar levels may lead to confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures, or even death if not promptly addressed.
2. Foot Ulcer Infection: The worsening foot ulcer increases the risk of infection, which can spread and potentially lead to cellulitis, osteomyelitis, or sepsis.
3. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated International Normalized Ratio indicates a potential bleeding risk due to excessive anticoagulation. This could result in internal bleeding or increased risk of hemorrhage.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of blood clots, stroke,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. He presents with chronic non-healing ulcers on his left lower extremity, persistent hypoglycemia, elevated INR, and worsening foot ulcer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia could be due to overdose on oral hypoglycemics, infection (especially known foot infection), cardiac ischemia, insulinoma, or ethanol withdrawal. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause. 
2. Foot Ulcer Infection: The patient has a left first toe cellulitis/ulcer that requires treatment. He will be followed by podiatry for debridement when INR is down, and he will continue receiving vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl as per podiatry recommendations.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient's recent increase in coumadin dose has led to an elevated INR of 9.5. Coumadin will be held, and he will receive vitamin K 1 mg orally once. His coagulation status will be monitored daily, and he will continue taking verapamil and digoxin with level monitoring.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Rate controlled with verapamil.  Holding

 HYPOGLYCEMIA:  Persistently hypoglycemic through the night requiring
   D10 drip and repeat D50.  Will start octreotide to counteract possible
   effect of bactrim.  continues to require frequent fingersticks so will
   need to stay in the ICU.
 TYPE II DIABETES: As above, continue to hold oral hyperglycemic
   agents.
 COAGULOPATHY:  Some improvement in INR holding coumadin, received 1
   mg vit K yesterday.
 ANEMIA:  Stable hct overnight.
 HYPERKALEMIA:  Down this morning after receiving kaexalate overnight.
   Repeat labs this afternoon to follow.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY/LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY ULCER:  On broad
   spectrum antibiotics as per podiatry recommendations.  WBC trending
   down.
 CARDIAC:  Small effusions on xray, decreased BS left base.  No
   symptoms suggestive of pulmnary infection.  Had been on diuretics in
   the past and these were topped in the past couple of months for unclear
   reasons.  Also his wife noted that his lower extremity edema in that
   time period as well.  Will check cardiac enzymes, repeat ECG.   Repeat
   echo to evaluate for new wall motion abnormalities.
 HYPERTENSION:  Consider holding lisinopril if hyperkalemia persists.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic non-healing lower extremity ulcers, and recent presentation with persistent hypoglycemia, elevated INR, and worsening foot ulcer.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing persistent hypoglycemia, which may be due to sulfonylurea toxicity or interaction with sulfamethoxazole. Close monitoring of blood sugars and appropriate management with FSG q2h, insulin sliding scale, and D50 bolus PRN hypoglycemia should be continued.

2. Left toe cellulitis/ulcer: The patient has a chronic non-healing ulcer on the left first toe with cellulitis. Podiatry follow-up is planned for debridement today, despite the elevated INR. Continuing vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl as per podiatry recommendations, wound care with cultures, and f/u pending cultures should be implemented.

3. Atrial fibrillation (afib): Recent increase in coumadin dose has been held due to an elevated INR of 3.5. Coumadin should be held, and coags should be monitored daily. Verapamil and digoxin should be continued.

   68 y/o M w/hx of DM2, HTN, afib on coumadin, LLE chrnic non-healing
   ulcers, who now presents with persistent hypoglycemia, elevated INR,
   and worsening foot ulcer.

   #. Hypoglycemia - DDx includes overdose on oral hypoglycemics,
   infection (esp known foot infection), cardiac ischemia, insulinoma.
   Patient says he has been taking normal dose of home metformin and
   glipizide. Only recent medication change was that patient took Bactrim.
   Perhaps this interacted with home glipizide to increase levels.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic non-healing ulcers on lower left extremity, and recent presentation with persistent hypoglycemia, elevated INR, and worsening foot ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing persistent hypoglycemia. Differential diagnosis includes overdose on oral hypoglycemics, infection (especially known foot infection), cardiac ischemia, and insulinoma. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Left first toe cellulitis/ulcer: The patient has a chronic non-healing ulcer on the left toe, which has now developed cellulitis. Treatment includes wound care, debridement performed by podiatry when the INR is down, and continuation of antibiotics as per podiatry recommendations.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's recent increase in coumadin dose has resulted in an elevated INR of 7.8. Immediate management includes holding coumadin, giving additional vitamin K, monitoring coagulation, and checking digoxin levels. Verapamil will continue to be administered, and the patient's heart rhythm will be closely monitored.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia. Further"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical conditions and complications. The note highlights the following assessments and potential medical complications:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced an episode of hypoglycemia, which is unclear in etiology but may be multifactorial, possibly related to the use of Bactrim medication and confusion with medication dosages.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has signs of CHF, as indicated by diminished breath sounds at the lung bases, weight of 146.8 kg, and a chest X-ray suggesting right effusion and volume overload. The patient responded positively to Lasix, an diuretic medication.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient had an episode of hyperglycemia last evening requiring insulin. The patient was on a D10 (dextrose 50%) drip, which suggests the need for close monitoring of blood glucose levels.

4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has an irregular heart rhythm of AFib, which is rate-controlled. Coumadin, an anticoagulant, is being held due to the anticipated procedure.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient received an additional 1 mg IV vitamin K yesterday and is showing improvement in their INR levels. They are still holding Coumadin, an anticoagulant.

6. Pain control: The patient denies any pain this morning"
