   Microbiology: [**8-16**] -[**8-18**] 6 sets VRE
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology.
   .
   PEA Arrest: Ddx includes hypovolemia, hypoxia, tamponade, PE. Since
   resolved rather quickly and occured in context of positional change
   think maybe more likely hypovolemia. Ruled out for MI. Did not obtain
   CTA to r/o PE because would not anticoagulate given plt count is 9.
   -consider CTA as onc attending would consider filter or anticoagulation
   if plts > 50
   .
   Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: CT CHEST yesterday showed evidence of
   worsening bilateral pleural effusions without infiltrate which could be
   causing atelectasis and hypoxemia. Other possible etiology is PE though
   this is less likely given no evidence of elevated PA pressures or right
   sided strain on ECHO. No evidence of PNA, ARDS or interstitial lung
   process on CT.
   - Continue ventilator, follow sats and abgs
   - Consider tapping effusion
   - consider CTA to r/o PE
   .
   VRE SEPSIS: Neutropenic with 6/6 cx positive for VRE. Lines were
   changed [**8-17**] and patient was started on daptomycin.
   - Continue dapto
   - Follow ANC
   - follow fever curve and wbc count
   - consider neupogen
   - f/u ID recs, if any
   .
   Pericardial effusion/ tamponade: Small effusion on Echo. Repeat echo
   after PEA arrest equivocal for tamponade. Patient had episode of
   hypotension this am but normal pulsus and no elec alternans on ekg.
   - follow pulsus
   - labetalol for rate control to improve filling time if bp allows
   - cards recs
   - volume resuscitation with blood + lasix
   .
   Neutropenic fever: Two known sources at this point
   - continue Dapto and PO vanco for VRE and C. diff
   - cont cefepime and caspo per onc although these were empiric abx for
   neutropenic fever which we now have source for, may be able to peel
   these off slowly
   - continue acyclovir prophylaxis
   - demerol for rigors
   - f/u ONC and ID recs
   .
   Pancytopenia: due to recent chemo, at count nadirs. Pt did not bump
   plts or crit with most recent transfusions. Concern for hemolysis or RP
   bleed.
   - transfuse plts if less than 10 or active bleeding-gave one unit this
   am
   -consider abd/pelvis ct once stable
   - Blood for volume resuscitation- gave one unit blood
   -follow cbc tid
   .
   HTN: Patient has very labile blood pressure. Was on labetolol drip
   overnight for very elevated diastolic pressures. Dropped her pressure
   this am and was very fluid responsive. CVP in low 20s.
   - labetalol for rate control if hypertensive, currently normotensive so
   will hold for now
   .
   Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Possibly
   secondary to nutritional deficiency vs. DIC in setting of sepsis as
   crit not bumping with transfusions.
   -DIC and hemolysis labs
   - monitor coags
   .
   Pancreatitis: Thought to be secondary to recent cytarabine
   chemotherapy. No abdominal pain currently and LFTs trending down.
   - Keep NPO
   - TPN
   .
   .C. Diff:
   -continue PO vanco
   .
   ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable.
   - f/u onc recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and bacteremia caused by Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). He also has a possible tamponade physiology, hypotension, and pancytopenia. The patient has been receiving multiple treatments, including antibiotics, blood transfusions, and chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VRE Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for VRE bacteremia with daptomycin. It is crucial to continue monitoring the fever curve and white blood cell count to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.

2. Pericardial Effusion/Tamponade: The patient has a small effusion on echocardiogram, which may be causing tamponade physiology. Close monitoring of the patient's pulsus and consideration for repeat echocardiogram are necessary to rule out tamponade.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to worsening bilateral pleural effusions. Tapping the effusion and considering a CT angiogram (CTA) to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) are recommended.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is a result of recent chemotherapy. Close monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) and consideration for transfusion if plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology.
   .
   PEA Arrest: Ddx includes hypovolemia, hypoxia, tamponade, PE. Since
   resolved rather quickly and occured in context of positional change
   think maybe more likely hypovolemia. Ruled out for MI. Did not obtain
   CTA to r/o PE because would not anticoagulate given plt count is 9.
   -consider CTA as onc attending would consider filter or anticoagulation
   if plts > 50- will hold off for now
   -CVP not reliable indicator of volume status
   -transfuse to increase intravasc volume
   .
   Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: CT CHEST yesterday showed evidence of
   worsening bilateral pleural effusions without infiltrate which could be
   causing atelectasis and hypoxemia. Other possible etiology is PE though
   this is less likely given no evidence of elevated PA pressures or right
   sided strain on ECHO. No evidence of PNA, ARDS or interstitial lung
   process on CT.
   - Continue ventilator, follow sats and abgs
   - Consider tapping effusion
   - consider CTA to r/o PE- will hold off for now
   .
   VRE SEPSIS: Neutropenic with 6/6 cx positive for VRE. Lines were
   changed [**8-17**] and patient was started on daptomycin.
   - Continue dapto
   - Follow ANC
   - follow fever curve and wbc count
   - consider neupogen
   - f/u ID recs
   -may need TEE given high grade bacteremia
   -may need another line change because positive bld cx present after
   removing previous lines
   -daily ekg to look at pr interval
   .
   Pericardial effusion/ tamponade: Small effusion on Echo. Repeat echo
   after PEA arrest equivocal for tamponade. Patient had episode of
   hypotension this am but normal pulsus and no elec alternans on ekg.
   - follow pulsus
   - labetalol for rate control to improve filling time if bp allows
   - cards recs
   - volume resuscitation with blood + lasix
   .
   Neutropenic fever: Two known sources at this point
   - continue Dapto and PO vanco for VRE and C. diff
   - cont cefepime and caspo per onc although these were empiric abx for
   neutropenic fever which we now have source for, may be able to peel
   these off slowly
   - continue acyclovir prophylaxis
   - demerol for rigors
   - f/u ONC and ID recs
   .
   Pancytopenia: due to recent chemo, at count nadirs. Pt did not bump
   plts or crit with most recent transfusions. Concern for hemolysis or RP
   bleed.
   - transfuse plts if less than 10 or active bleeding-gave one unit this
   am
   -consider abd/pelvis ct once stable
   - Blood for volume resuscitation- gave one unit blood
   -follow cbc tid
   .
   HTN: Patient has very labile blood pressure. Was on labetolol drip
   overnight for very elevated diastolic pressures. Dropped her pressure
   this am and was very fluid responsive. CVP in low 20s.
   - use labetolol for rate control if hypertensive, currently
   normotensive so will hold for now
   .
   Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Possibly
   secondary to nutritional deficiency vs. DIC in setting of sepsis as
   crit not bumping with transfusions.
   -DIC and hemolysis labs
   - monitor coags
   .
   Pancreatitis: Thought to be secondary to recent cytarabine
   chemotherapy. No abdominal pain currently and LFTs trending down.
   - Keep NPO
   - TPN
   .
   .C. Diff:
   -continue PO vanco
   .
   ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable.
   - f/u onc recs
   .
   FEN: NPO, repletes lytes PRN, TPN- may consider discontinuing this in
   setting of high grade bacteremia
   .
   PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, mouthcare

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which resolved quickly and may be related to hypovolemia rather than tamponade physiology. The patient also has hypoxic respiratory distress, bilateral pleural effusions, pancytopenia due to recent chemotherapy, labile blood pressure, coagulopathy, pancreatitis, Clostridium difficile infection, and is at count nadirs for ALL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further hypoxemia and potential respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABGs is necessary.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels increase the risk of infections, bleeding, and impaired healing. Close monitoring of blood counts and appropriate interventions such as transfusions or growth factors may be required.
3. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure and previous episodes of hypotension suggest ongoing volume instability. Frequent monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters is necessary to guide fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support if needed.

s assessment and plan as described above.  BC again pos yesterday.
   We have started linezolid. It seems she continues to have a high grade
   bacteremia.  We placed an IJ last night but the line looped and was
   removed. I am inclined to give her another day of linezolid and then
   try again to replace line.  We are continuing other abx. Fluid balance
   continues to be pos which will further complicate weaning if she
   stabilizes. Will try to limit fluids today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented to the ICU with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). She has experienced multiple complications including a possible cardiac tamponade, pancytopenia due to recent chemotherapy, coagulopathy, Clostridium difficile infection, and fluid overload. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has an ongoing infection with VRE bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of worsening sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation, ventilation parameters, and respiratory status is essential.
3. Tamponade physiology: The patient may have cardiac tamponade, which can be life-threatening. Regular echocardiography and close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters are crucial.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia due to recent chemotherapy. Frequent monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) and appropriate management of bleeding and infection risks are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology with recent PEA arrest.
   .
   # Sepsis: Neutropenic with 6/6 cx positive for VRE. Lines were changed
   [**8-17**] and patient was started on daptomycin and converted to linezolid
   yesterday.  Neupogen started yesterday as well.
   - Continue linezolid, cefepime, acyclovir, and caspofungin
   - Follow ANC
   - Surveillance cultures this PM.
   - follow fever curve and wbc count
   - f/u ID recs
   - Per ID, plan for TEE Monday
   - Continue using current left subclavian CVL for now. If patient has
   blood cultures this afternoon that are negative tomorrow afternoon,
   will consider switching out with clean CVL.  Would consider placing EJ
   to bridge to new CVL.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Two known sources at this point with VRE and
   C.diff. Started neupogen yesterday.
   - continue linezolid and PO vanco for VRE and C. diff
   - Continue neupogen.
   - cont cefepime and caspo per onc although these were empiric abx for
   neutropenic fever
   - continue acyclovir prophylaxis
   - demerol for rigor
   - f/u oncology and ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # PEA Arrest: Ddx includes hypovolemia, hypoxia, tamponade, PE. Since
   resolved rather quickly and occured in context of positional change
   think maybe more likely hypovolemia. Ruled out for MI. Did not obtain
   CTA to r/o PE because would not anticoagulate given plt count is 9.
   -consider CTA as onc attending would consider filter or anticoagulation
   if plts > 50- will hold off for now
   -CVP not reliable indicator of volume status
   -transfuse to increase intravasc volume
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Continue with AC and albuterol MDI
   .
   # Pancytopenia: due to recent chemo, at count nadirs. Patient with
   significant bleeding with RIJ removal requiring 2units platelets and 2
   units FFP with appropriate increase in platelets.  She has received 2u
   PRBC on [**8-18**] and 1 u PRBC yesterday.
   - Trend hct
   - transfuse plts if less than 10 or active bleeding
    -consider abd/pelvis ct once stable
   -follow cbc tid
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Possibly
   secondary to nutritional deficiency vs. DIC in setting of sepsis as hct
   not bumping with transfusions.
    - monitor coags
   - Consider repeat DIC labs.
   .
   # C. Diff: Continue PO vanco
   .
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and bacteremia caused by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). The patient had a previous PEA arrest, which resolved quickly and may have been related to hypovolemia or tamponade physiology. The patient also has pancytopenia due to recent chemotherapy, coagulopathy, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is neutropenic and has positive blood cultures for VRE, indicating a severe infection that could progress to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets due to recent chemotherapy. This can lead to anemia, increased risk of infection, and bleeding complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which indicates a tendency for excessive bleeding. This increases the risk of hemorrhage.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient has a current C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology with recent PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA Arrest: Ddx includes hypovolemia, hypoxia, tamponade, PE. Since
   resolved rather quickly and occured in context of positional change
   think maybe more likely hypovolemia. Ruled out for MI. Did not obtain
   CTA to r/o PE because would not anticoagulate given plt count is 9.
   -consider CTA as onc attending would consider filter or anticoagulation
   if plts > 50- will hold off for now
   -CVP not reliable indicator of volume status
   -transfuse to increase intravasc volume
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Patient hypoxic overnight found to be
   difficult to vent likely secondary to mucus plugs.  Patient found
   - Continue with AC
   - aeroslized NAC, albuterol MDI
   .
   # VRE SEPSIS: Neutropenic with 6/6 cx positive for VRE. Lines were
   changed [**8-17**] and patient was started on daptomycin and converted to
   linezolid yesterday.  Neupogen started yesterday as well.
   - Follow ANC
   - follow fever curve and wbc count
   - f/u ID recs
   - Per ID, plan for TEE Monday
   - may need another line change because positive bld cx present after
   removing previous lines
   - daily ekg to look at pr interval
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/ tamponade: Small effusion on Echo. Repeat echo
   after PEA arrest equivocal for tamponade. Patient had episode of
   hypotension this am but normal pulsus and no elec alternans on ekg.
   - follow pulsus
   - labetalol for rate control to improve filling time if bp allows
   - cards recs
   - volume resuscitation with blood + lasix
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient was restarted on levophed overnight secondary
   to hypotension. Prior night was hypertensive requiring labetolol drip.
   - Wean off levophed with goal MAP>60.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Two known sources at this point
   - continue linezolid and PO vanco for VRE and C. diff
   - cont cefepime and caspo per onc although these were empiric abx for
   neutropenic fever
   - continue acyclovir prophylaxis
   - demerol for rigor
   - f/u oncology and ID recs
   .
   # Pancytopenia: due to recent chemo, at count nadirs. Patient with
   significant bleeding with RIJ removal requiring 2units platelets and 2
   units FFP with appropriate increase in platelets.
   - transfuse plts if less than 10 or active bleeding-gave one unit this
   am
   -consider abd/pelvis ct once stable
   -follow cbc tid
   .
   HTN: Patient has very labile blood pressure. Was on labetolol drip
   overnight for very elevated diastolic pressures. Dropped her pressure
   this am and was very fluid responsive. CVP in low 20s.
   - use labetolol for rate control if hypertensive, currently
   normotensive so will hold for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient experienced a previous episode of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely due to hypovolemia. The patient also has a small pericardial effusion and may have tamponade physiology, although it has not been confirmed definitively.

The patient's vital signs are currently stable, but they have been labile throughout the stay, requiring adjustments in blood pressure medications. The patient's respiratory distress is thought to be secondary to mucus plugs and is being managed with aerosolized N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and albuterol. The patient's pancytopenia is attributed to recent chemotherapy, and he has required blood product transfusions due to bleeding complications during the placement and removal of a right internal jugular (RIJ) line.

The patient's blood cultures have grown VRE, and he has been started on linezolid after failing to respond to daptomycin. Neupogen has been initiated to stimulate white blood cell production. The patient's coagulopathy is suspected to be secondary to nutritional deficiency rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hemolysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology with recent PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA Arrest: Ddx includes hypovolemia, hypoxia, tamponade, PE. Since
   resolved rather quickly and occured in context of positional change
   think maybe more likely hypovolemia. Ruled out for MI. Did not obtain
   CTA to r/o PE because would not anticoagulate given plt count is 9.
   -consider CTA as onc attending would consider filter or anticoagulation
   if plts > 50- will hold off for now
   -CVP not reliable indicator of volume status
   -transfuse to increase intravasc volume
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Patient hypoxic overnight found to be
   difficult to vent likely secondary to mucus plugs.  Patient found
   - Continue with AC
   - Albuterol MDI
   .
   # VRE SEPSIS: Neutropenic with 6/6 cx positive for VRE. Lines were
   changed [**8-17**] and patient was started on daptomycin and converted to
   linezolid yesterday.  Neupogen started yesterday as well.
   - Replace L subclavian over wire
   - Follow ANC
   - follow fever curve and wbc count
   - f/u ID recs
   - Per ID, plan for TEE Monday
   - may need another line change because positive bld cx present after
   removing previous lines
   - daily ekg to look at pr interval
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/ tamponade: Small effusion on Echo. Repeat echo
   after PEA arrest equivocal for tamponade. Patient had episode of
   hypotension this am but normal pulsus and no elec alternans on ekg.
   - follow pulsus
   - labetalol for rate control to improve filling time if bp allows
   - cards recs
   - volume resuscitation with blood + lasix
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient was restarted on levophed overnight secondary
   to hypotension. Prior night was hypertensive requiring labetolol drip.
   - Wean off levophed with goal MAP>60.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Two known sources at this point
   - continue linezolid and PO vanco for VRE and C. diff
   - cont cefepime and caspo per onc although these were empiric abx for
   neutropenic fever
   - continue acyclovir prophylaxis
   - demerol for rigor
   - f/u oncology and ID recs
   .
   # Pancytopenia: due to recent chemo, at count nadirs. Patient with
   significant bleeding with RIJ removal requiring 2units platelets and 2
   units FFP with appropriate increase in platelets.  She has received 2u
   PRBC on [**8-18**] and 1 u PRBC yesterday.
   - Hematocrit continues to trend down to 24.6 from 28.1. Recheck hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse plts if less than 10 or active bleeding-gave one unit this
   am
   -consider abd/pelvis ct once stable
   -follow cbc tid
   .
   HTN: Patient has very labile blood pressure. Was on labetolol drip
   overnight for very elevated diastolic pressures. Dropped her pressure
   this am and was very fluid responsive. CVP in low 20s.
   - use labetolol for rate control if hypertensive, currently
   normotensive so will hold for now
   .
   Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Possibly
   secondary to nutritional deficiency vs. DIC in setting of sepsis as
   crit not bumping with transfusions.
   -DIC and hemolysis labs
   - monitor coags
   .
   Pancreatitis: Thought to be secondary to recent cytarabine
   chemotherapy. No abdominal pain currently and LFTs trending down.
   - Keep NPO
   - TPN

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and VRE bacteremia. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which resolved quickly and is believed to be related to hypovolemia. The patient also has hypoxic respiratory distress, likely secondary to mucus plugs, and a small pericardial effusion that may indicate tamponade physiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is neutropenic with positive blood cultures for VRE, indicating a severe infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and can be life-threatening.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may progress to respiratory failure, especially if mucus plugs continue to obstruct the airways. Mechanical ventilation may be required.
3. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a small pericardial effusion, which may progress to cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation around the heart impairs its ability to pump effectively.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's recent chemotherapy has caused pancytopenia, resulting in low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This increases the risk of bleeding and infection.
5. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade. She experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which resolved quickly. She has been diagnosed with pancytopenia due to recent chemotherapy, C. difficile infection, coagulopathy, and elevated bilirubin levels. The patient is currently receiving treatment for these conditions and is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever and positive blood cultures for VRE indicate an ongoing risk of sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and response to antibiotics is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and RSBI of 147 suggest a potential risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation, respiratory effort, and response to interventions is necessary.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood counts increase the risk of bleeding and infection. Regular monitoring of complete blood counts and appropriate management with platelet and red blood cell transfusions are required.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient is receiving treatment for C. difficile infection. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection or complications such as toxic megacolon.

   Assessment and Plan
   38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology with recent PEA arrest.
   .
   # Sepsis: Neutropenic with cx positive for VRE. Lines were changed [**8-17**]
   and patient was started on daptomycin, which was switched to linezolid.
   Pt also started on Neupogen ([**8-19**]). Sureveillance blood cultures
   without growth since [**8-20**]. CVL pulled yesterday, now with PIVx2 in
   place.  Blood cultures demonstrate VRE sensitive to daptomycin.
   - Continue linezolid as patient continued to have high grade bacteremia
   in setting of dapto therapy.
   - Continue empiric cefepime, acyclovir, caspofungin
   - Follow ANC
   - Surveillance cultures [**Hospital1 **] and f/u cx and sensitivities.
   - follow fever curve and wbc count
   - f/u ID recs
   - TEE today
   - If able to maintain PIV, plan for line holiday in order to help clear
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Two known sources at this point with VRE and
   C.diff. Pt currently treated with neupogen  Pt has been afebrile
   - continue linezolid and PO vanco for VRE and C. diff
   - Continue neupogen.
   - CMV VL pending
   - cont empiric cefepime and caspo per onc
   - continue acyclovir prophylaxis
   - demerol for rigor
   - f/u oncology and ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # PEA Arrest: Likely secondary to decreased preload due to positional
   change, intrasvascular volume depletion, and tamponade physiology.
   - CVP not reliable indicator of volume status --> likely [**12-18**] exterior
   compression of heart from effusions.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Continue with AC and albuterol MDI. Last RSBI
   147.  Overall volume status appears to be contributing to respiratory
   failure.  LOS fluid balance is 7.6 liters positive.
   - Wean sedation
   - Keep net balance even to negative, patient likely fluid overloaded.
   - Use lasix IV or gtt if unable to keep even to negative.
   - Consider thoracentesis
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.  Patient
   received 1u PRBC and 1u plateltes yesterday.
   - Recheck CBC Q12H
   - Transfuse for hct <21 (if no signs of end organ dysfunction) or plt
   <10 (if no signs of bleeding).
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Tbili continues to increase this AM to 4.5 from
   4, predominantly direct.  Transaminases appear to be leveling of with
   AST decrased this AM to 93.  LDH continues to rise to 2237 from 1232,
   and lipase trending down this AM to 113 from 441.  Likely represent
   hepatobiliary process, and patient has had cholecystectomy in past.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also represent acute pancreatitis.  Unlikely to be hemolysis as
   hyperbili is mostly conjugated.
   - RUQ ultrasound today
   - Trend LFTs and Tbili.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.  Less likely to be DIC as
   fibrinogen was >800 yesterday.
   - monitor coags
   .
   # C. Diff: Continue PO vanco
   .
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable.
   - f/u onc recs
   .
   # FEN: TF restarted yesterday but held this AM secondary to increased
   residuals.   Plan to restart today, consider starting promotility [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   (metoclopramide or erythryomycin) and consider post-pyloric tube.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently in the ICU. He presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient had a recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He is currently on multiple antibiotics, including linezolid, cefepime, acyclovir, and caspofungin. The patient also has pancytopenia likely secondary to recent chemotherapy, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, C. diff infection, and is planned for bone marrow transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has VRE bacteremia and is already being treated with linezolid. Close monitoring of fever curve and white blood cell count is essential.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory distress and is on assisted ventilation. Weaning sedation and managing fluid balance to avoid overload are important.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets due to chemotherapy. Frequent monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) and appropriate transfusion if indicated.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin levels are increasing, predominantly direct. Further evaluation with RUQ ultrasound and trend of liver function tests (LFTs) is necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia, and possible tamponade physiology following recent chemotherapy. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, likely secondary to decreased preload due to positional change, intravascular volume depletion, and tamponade physiology. She also has pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, Clostridium difficile infection, and ongoing treatment for ALL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has neutropenic fever with positive blood cultures for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). She is currently being treated with antibiotics, but there is a risk of ongoing or recurrent sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to respiratory distress. Weaning off FiO2 and adjusting ventilator settings will be important to monitor.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has low counts of white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), and platelets (PLT) likely due to recent chemotherapy. Close monitoring of blood counts and transfusion support may be necessary.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin levels are increasing, predominantly direct. This could be related to hepatobiliary processes or acute pancreatitis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade. The patient had a previous pericardiocentesis on [**2135-8-17**] and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely secondary to decreased preload due to positional change, intravascular volume depletion, and tamponade physiology.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, C. difficile infection, and ALL. He has been treated with multiple antibiotics including daptomycin, linezolid, cefepime, acyclovir, and caspofungin. The patient is also receiving Neupogen to stimulate white blood cell production.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic state and positive blood cultures for VRE indicate a high risk for sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, fever curve, and white blood cell count is essential.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) suggest a high risk of respiratory failure. Weaning off FiO2 and monitoring the patient's response to assisted ventilation is crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology with recent PEA arrest.
   .
   # Sepsis: Neutropenic with cx positive for VRE. Lines were changed [**8-17**]
   and patient was started on daptomycin, which was switched to linezolid.
   Pt also started on Neupogen ([**8-19**]). Sureveillance blood cultures
   without growth since [**8-20**]. CVL pulled yesterday, now with PIVx2 in
   place.  Blood cultures demonstrate VRE sensitive to daptomycin.
   - Continue linezolid as patient continued to have high grade bacteremia
   in setting of dapto therapy.
   - Continue empiric cefepime, acyclovir, caspofungin
   - Follow ANC
   - Surveillance cultures [**Hospital1 **] and f/u cx and sensitivities.
   - follow fever curve and wbc count
   - f/u ID recs
   - TEE today
   - If able to maintain PIV, plan for line holiday in order to help clear
   bacteremia.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Two known sources at this point with VRE and
   C.diff. Pt currently treated with neupogen  Pt has been afebrile
   - continue linezolid and PO vanco for VRE and C. diff
   - Continue neupogen.
   - CMV VL pending
   - cont empiric cefepime and caspo per onc
   - continue acyclovir prophylaxis
   - demerol for rigor
   - f/u oncology and ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # PEA Arrest: Likely secondary to decreased preload due to positional
   change, intrasvascular volume depletion, and tamponade physiology.
   - CVP not reliable indicator of volume status --> likely [**12-18**] exterior
   compression of heart from effusions.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Continue with AC and albuterol MDI. Last RSBI
   147.
   - Wean sedation
   - Keep net balance equal, patient likely fluid overloaded.
   -
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.  Patient
   received 1u PRBC and 1u plateltes yesterday.
   - Recheck CBC Q12H
   - Transfuse for hct <21 or plt <10(if no signs of bleeding).
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Tbili continues to increase this AM to 4.5 from
   4, predominantly direct.  Transaminases appear to be leveling of with
   AST decrased this AM to 93.  LDH continues to rise to 2237 from 1232,
   and lipase trending down this AM to 113 from 441.  Likely represent
   hepatobiliary process, and patient has had cholecystectomy in past.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also represent acute pancreatitis.  Unlikely to be hemolysis as
   hyperbili is mostly conjugated.
   - RUQ ultrasound
   - Check hemolysis labs
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.  Less likely to be DIC as
   fibrinogen was >800 yesterday.
   - monitor coags
   - Repeat DIC labs.
   .
   # C. Diff: Continue PO vanco
   .
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable.
   - f/u onc recs
   .
   # FEN: TF restarted yesterday but held this AM secondary to increased
   residuals.   Plan to restart today, consider starting erythromycin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient experienced a possible tamponade physiology and had a previous pericardial effusion. He also had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, likely due to decreased preload, intravascular volume depletion, and tamponade physiology.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and VRE bacteremia. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a recent respiratory syncytial virus (RSBI) score of 158.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hct) level of 23.9%, thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 38 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood cultures are positive for VRE, which is sensitive to daptomycin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). She had a previous episode of pericardial effusion and possible tamponade physiology, which led to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including linezolid, cefepime, caspofungin, and vancomycin, for the treatment of VRE bacteremia and C. difficile infection. She is also receiving Neupogen to stimulate white blood cell production. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and possible central nervous system involvement with leftward gaze deviation. She is on mechanical ventilation and has a central venous line, arterial line, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube (PEG tube) in place. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently receiving ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with neutropenic fever and bacteremia caused by VRE. This puts her at risk for sepsis, especially considering her compromised immune system due to chemotherapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory"

2. Gaze Deviation: The patient has developed a new onset leftward gaze deviation, which could be due to septic emboli or a stroke. A head CT should be obtained to further evaluate this.
3. PEA Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which was likely caused by decreased preload due to positional change, intravascular volume depletion, and tamponade physiology. Thoracentesis may be considered to relieve any potential effusions compressing the heart.

   # Sepsis: Neutropenic with cx positive for VRE. CVL pulled on [**8-21**],
   midline placed ([**8-22**]).  Pt currently being treated with linezolid
   ([**8-20**]). Sureveillance BCx and CVL tip are no growth since the [**8-20**]. Pt
   also started on Neupogen ([**8-19**])  Blood cultures and catheter tips have
   demonstrate VRE sensitive to daptomycin.  ID recommends continuing
   2-weeks of linezolid and then re-visit issue as to whether to get TEE
   and re-evaluate and help determine if you can d/c linezolid at that
   point.
   - Continue linezolid for 2-weeks from last negative culture ([**9-3**])
   - Continue empiric cefepime and caspofungin
   - Follow ANC (WBC <0.1)
   - f/u cx and sensitivities
   - follow fever curve and wbc count
   - f/u ID recs
   - Plan for TEE in 2 weeks
   - If able to maintain midline, plan for continued line holiday.
   .
   #. Gaze Deviation: Pt with new onset leftward gaze deviation, that
   resolved with holding sedation.  However, gaze deviation persists this
   AM.  Stat head CT obtained yesterday that did not show any acute
   pathology.  Gaze deviation could be [**12-18**] sedation, but pt at high risk
   for septic emboli.
   - t/c MRI continues to have neurologic findings despite weaning
   sedation
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Two known sources at this point with VRE and
   C.diff. Pt currently treated with neupogen  Pt has been afebrile
   - continue linezolid and PO vanco for VRE and C. diff
   - Continue neupogen.
   - CMV VL negative
   - cont empiric cefepime and caspo
   - continue acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u oncology and ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Continue with AC and albuterol MDI. Last RSBI
   203.  Overall volume status appears to be contributing to respiratory
   failure.  LOS fluid balance is >7 liters positive.  Has been -117cc
   balance over 24hrs, but postive since midnight.  Cr minimally increased
   to 1.3 from yesterday.
   - Keep net balance negative as long as Cr stable goal is -1.5L ,
   patient likely fluid overloaded.
   - Cont lasix gtt  and check PM lytes
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.  Patient
   received 3u plateltes yesterday.
   - Recheck CBC Q12H
   - Transfuse for hct <25  or plt <30 (if no signs of bleeding) per BMT.
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: RUQ did not show any CBD dilation.  Cont to trend
   LFT and TBili.  Cont elevated Tbili that is mainly Direct.   Likely
   represent hepatobiliary process, and patient has had cholecystectomy in
   past.   Unlikely to be hemolysis as hyperbili is mostly conjugated.
   Pancreatic enzymes normal
   -          Trend LFTs and Tbili.
   -          Check pancreatic enzymes
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.  Less likely to be DIC as
   fibrinogen has been >800.
   -          monitor coags
   -          will give vit K
   .
   # C. Diff: Continue PO vanco

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and VRE bacteremia. He also had possible cardiac tamponade physiology with a recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently being treated with linezolid and has surveillance blood cultures and central venous line (CVL) tips that show no growth since August 20th. His blood cultures and CVL tips demonstrate VRE sensitive to daptomycin. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, bacteremia, C. difficile infection, altered mental status, and pancytopenia. The patient's treatment plan includes continuing linezolid for two more weeks, following ANC (white blood cell count) trends, f/u CX and sensitivities, f/u fever curve and WBC count, f/u ID recs, planning for transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in two weeks, and possibly discontinuing linezolid at that point. The patient's recent vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 148/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending."

   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs - TEE at some point to determine length of antibiotic
   treatment. In [**Last Name (un) 1189**] sensitivities may not fully represent in [**Last Name (un) 1190**]
   situation - so keep on linezolid for now, and may switch to dapto after
   2 weeks of therapy with linezolid.
   - Lateral gaze resolved with holding sedation
   - Hypertensive, given labetolol and hydral x1,  restarted proprofol -
   will hold off sedation in morning, reevaluate gaze - if still
   persistent, consider MRI to assess for septic emboli
   - Lasix drip with good diuresis; creatinine bump from 1.2 > 1.3
   - KUB - Final read pending
   - CT head with contrast - 1. No evidence of acute intracranial
   abnormalities. 2. Fluid throughout the paranasal sinuses. While this
   may be related to the presence of the nasogastric and endotracheal
   tubes, acute sinusitis cannot be excluded.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient experienced a recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

The patient has been treated with linezolid for VRE bacteremia and is currently being monitored for potential complications. Surveillance blood cultures and catheter tips have shown sensitivity to daptomycin, and the ID recommends continuing linezolid for two weeks before re-evaluating and determining whether to proceed with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess the length of antibiotic treatment.

The patient's left lateral gaze deviation resolved with the holding of sedation but has persisted this morning. A head CT obtained yesterday did not show any acute pathology. The gaze deviation could be attributed to sedation or septic emboli.

The patient also has neutropenic fever with known sources of VRE and C. difficile infection. He is currently being treated with Neupogen and continues to be afebrile. The patient's CMV viral load is negative, and he is receiving empirical cefepime and caspofungin therapy.

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with assisted ventilation and albuterol metered-dose inhaler. The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload, and lasix"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has neutropenic fever with positive cultures for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Despite therapy and removal of the central venous line, the patient continues to have positive cultures, indicating persistent infection and a high risk of sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress. The respiratory failure may be contributing to overall fluid overload, as evidenced by the use of diuretics and the need to monitor electrolyte imbalances.

3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, primarily direct bilirubin. This could be due to hepatobiliary processes, previous cholecystectomy, sepsis, or complications related to leukemia such as lymphoma. Further evaluation with imaging studies is recommended.

4. Fecal incontinence/Encopresis: The patient has had no bowel movements for five days despite having a post-pyloric feeding tube in place. This could be due to bowel obstruction, decreased motility, or other gastrointestinal issues. Imaging studies and changes in bowel regimen are planned to address this issue.

   - lasix drip --> pt essentially even, but has been putting out
   100-200cc/hr. Pt was essentially even, but with good urine output.
   Foley was replaced yesterday because of poor return and urine sent for
   culture.

   # Sepsis: Neutropenic with cx positive for VRE. CVL pulled on [**8-21**],
   midline placed ([**8-22**]).  Pt currently being treated with linezolid
   ([**8-20**]). Cx from [**8-20**] and [**8-21**] from a-line are positive today.  The
   other BCx are no growth since the [**8-20**]. Pt also started on Neupogen
   ([**8-19**])  Blood cultures and catheter tips have demonstrate VRE sensitive
   to daptomycin.  ID recommends continuing 2-weeks of linezolid and then
   re-visit issue as to whether to get TEE and re-evaluate and help
   determine if you can d/c linezolid at that point.
   - Continue linezolid for 2-weeks from last negative culture ([**9-4**])
   - Continue empiric cefepime and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] discuss with ID again
   when we can discontinue
   - Follow ANC (WBC <0.1)
   - f/u cx and sensitivities
   - follow fever curve and wbc count
   - f/u ID recs
   - Re-evaluate whether TEE is ness in 2 weeks
   - If able to maintain midline, plan for continued line holiday.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Continue with AC and albuterol MDI.  Overall
   volume status appears to be contributing to respiratory failure.  Pt
   was started on lasix drip, currently at 7mg/hr, and had UOP of
   100-200cc/hr throughout the day.  However, due to large amount of
   fluids given with antibiotics and correcting free water deficit the
   patient has been essentially even.  Cr minimally increased to 1.4 from
   yesterday.
   - cont lasix ggt,
   - Keep net balance -1.5L as Cr stable  patient likely fluid overloaded.
   - Check PM lytes
   - t/d with ID whether we can stop some antibiotics which is
   contributing to overall fluid input
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: RUQ did not show any CBD dilation.  LFT and TBili
   continue to rise.  Cont elevated Tbili that is mainly Direct.   Likely
   represent hepatobiliary process, and patient has had cholecystectomy in
   past.  Pancreatic enzymes normal.
   - CT-abdomin to evaluate for hepatobiliary process and for eval of
   abdominal distension and increased residuals.
   -          Trend LFTs and Tbili.
   -          Check pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # FEN: Pt had post-pyloric OG tube placed by IR yesterday.  Nursing
   reports pt still has residuals.  KUB was performed, no obvious signs
   obstruction or dilated loops of bowel. Pt is on promotility [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   (metoclopramide and lactuolose) and bowel regimen.  However, pt still
   has not had a BM in 5 days.  Can not perform rectal suppositories given
   pts neutropenia.
   - CT-abdomin for eval
   - Increased lactulose to QID, cont metoclopramide, senna, docusate
   - t/c starting erythromycin
   - Repletes lytes PRN.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Pt has been afebrile.  Two known sources at this
   point with VRE and C.diff. Pt currently treated with neupogen  Pt has
   been afebrile
   - continue linezolid and PO vanco for VRE and C. diff
   - Continue neupogen.
   - cont empiric cefepime and caspo
   - continue acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u oncology and ID recs
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely secondary to recent chemotherapy.  Patient
   received 3u plateltes yesterday.
   - Recheck CBC Q12H
   - Transfuse for hct <25  or plt <30 (if no signs of bleeding) per BMT.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.  Less likely to be DIC as
   fibrinogen has been >800.
   -          monitor coags
   .
   # C. Diff: Continue PO vanco

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), status post chemotherapy, febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade with recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, neutropenic with central venous line (CVL) positive for VRE. The CVL was pulled on 08/21 and midline placed on 08/22. The patient is also being treated for respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), bacteremia, C. difficile infection (C diff, C diff colitis, Clostridium difficile), altered mental status (not delirium), and leukemia, acute (ALL, AML, cancer, malignant neoplasm).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be secondary to underlying conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is characterized by a sudden loss of kidney function. This can lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), currently undergoing chemotherapy. He presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and possible cardiac tamponade, resulting in a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is now in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has VRE bacteremia and continues to be neutropenic. Blood cultures are positive for VRE. He is on linezolid and cefepime, with plans to continue linezolid for two weeks after the last negative culture. Daily surveillance cultures are being done, and the patient's fever curve and white blood cell count are being monitored.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on the ventilator due to volume status. He had a negative fluid balance yesterday but remains with a positive fluid balance in the long-term oxygen saturation (LOS). His renal function is worsening, and diuresis will be needed for a successful outcome. Lasix gtt is being continued, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1 liter.

3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated total bilirubin levels, which could be caused by hepatobiliary pathology. However, there are no significant medications that would lead to biliary cholestasis. Liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels are being trended.

4. Neutropenic Fever: The patient had two known sources of infection with VRE and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Prophylactic medications are being given, including neupogen, acyclovir, and caspofungin.

5. FEN (Feeding): A post-pyloric orogastric tube (OGT) is in place. There are no signs of perforation or obstruction on the CT abdomen. The TF (total parenteral nutrition) and bowel regimen are being continued.

6. Pancytopenia: The patient may have pancytopenia, likely due to recent reinduction chemotherapy. Transfusion for hematocrit (Hct) <21 or platelet count (plt) <10 is planned, along with rechecking the complete blood count (CBC) this afternoon.

7. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) but is not on anticoagulation. This is likely due to nutritional deficiency. Coagulation parameters are being monitored.

8. C. Diff Infection: The patient is being treated for C. diff infection with oral vancomycin.

9. ALL Treatment: The patient recently underwent chemotherapy and is at the count nadirs. The plan is to perform a bone marrow transplant if the patient becomes medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU, and has functional status. Oncology recommendations are being followed up.

The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology. He experienced a recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient continues to be neutropenic with ongoing VRE sepsis. His arterial line and central venous line (CVL) have been removed, and a midline line has been placed. The patient's respiratory failure is contributing to continued ventilator dependence. There is a concern for worsening renal function despite diuretic therapy. The patient also has hyperbilirubinemia, likely secondary to hepatobiliary pathology, although the etiology is uncertain. He has had two known sources of infection with VRE and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient has pancytopenia, possibly due to recent reinduction chemotherapy. There is a plan for a bone marrow transplant if the patient stabilizes medically, becomes extubated, and has functional status. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. He is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a prophylactic stress ulcer regimen.

   Assessment and Plan
   38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology with recent PEA arrest.
   .
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis.  Blood cultures
   now positive for VRE from [**8-21**]. Arterial line and CVL have been removed
   and midline in place.
   - Continue linezolid for 2 weeks after last negative culture
   - Discuss with ID, but would be ideal from volume status standpoint to
   discontinue empiric cefepime and caspofungin therapy.
   - Surveillance cultures daily
   - Follow-up culture and sensitivities.
   - Follow fever curve and WBC
   - Follow-up with ID
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Volume status contributing to continued vent
   depedence.  Patient was net -566 cc yesterday, although continues to be
   +7 liters LOS.  Renal function appears to be worsening and oxygen
   requirement is increasing.
   - Continue lasix gtt, goal balance neg 1 liter. Switch IV meds to free
   water if possible given hypernatremia.
   - PM chemistries
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: CT abdomen/pelvis yesterday with signs of
   hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at
   this point. Patient not on significant meds that would lead to biliary
   cholestasis, although biliary cholestasis unlikely to lead to this
   level of hyperbilirubinemia.
   - Trend LFTS, bilirubin
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na this AM 146. Patient receiving free water boluses
   through OG.
   - Will attempt to switch IV meds to D5 if possible to reduce free water
   through TF and overall volume intake.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Patient afebrile overnight with two known sources
   of infection with VRE and C. diff.
   - Continue neupogen
   - Continue acyclovir prophylaxis.
   .
   # FEN: Post-pyloric OGT in place.  CT abdomen without signs of
   perforation or obstruction.  Patient with multiple watery bowel
   movements overnight, unclear if this is leakage around obstruction.
   - Continue TF
   - Continue reglan, lactulose, senokot, colace
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely in setting of recent reinduction.
   - Transfuse for hct<21 or plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding.
   - Recheck CBC this afternoon
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.  Less likely to be DIC as
   fibrinogen has been >800.
   - Monitor coags
   .
   # C. Diff: Continue PO vanco
   .
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone chemotherapy and is currently experiencing febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient recently had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

The patient is still neutropenic with VRE sepsis and blood cultures are positive for VRE. Arterial and central venous lines have been removed and replaced with a midline line. The plan is to continue linezolid for two weeks after the last negative culture and discuss with an infectious disease (ID) specialist. Empiric cefepime and caspofungin therapy may be discontinued based on volume status.

The patient also has respiratory failure, contributing to continued ventilator dependence. The patient's volume status is contributing to this issue, and there is a net negative fluid balance of 566 mL. Renal function appears to be worsening, and the oxygen requirement is increasing. The plan is to continue lasix gtt with a goal balance of negative 1 liter and switch IV medications to free water due to hypernatremia.

Hyperbilirubinemia is present, and the cause is uncertain at this point. The patient's bilirubin levels are being trended, and liver function tests (LFTs) will be monitored. The"

   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis.  Blood cultures
   now positive for VRE from [**8-21**]. Arterial line and CVL have been removed
   and midline in place.   Pt is tachy this morning and temp was 100.2
   this AM.  Pt is deteriorating and may represent early sepsis.
   - Continue linezolid for 2 weeks after last negative culture

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a past medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest but was resuscitated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis. Blood cultures have been positive for VRE since August 21st. Arterial line and central venous line have been removed and replaced with a midline catheter. The patient is tachycardic with a heart rate of 136 beats per minute and had a temperature of 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit this morning. The patient's clinical condition is deteriorating, indicating early sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure persists due to volume status contributing to continued ventilator dependence. The patient has a positive fluid balance of -121 mL since yesterday and continues to be 7 liters above the baseline output. Renal function appears to be worsening with an increase in creatinine to 2.1 this morning. Oxygen requirement is also increasing.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has been tachycardic with a heart rate ranging from 130 to 140 beats per minute this morning."

   .
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis.  Blood cultures
   now positive for VRE from [**8-21**]. Arterial line and CVL have been removed
   and midline in place.   Pt is tachy this morning and temp was 100.2
   this AM.  Pt is deteriorating and may represent early sepsis.
   - Continue linezolid for 2 weeks after last negative culture
   - Discussed with ID, will change empiric cefepime to meropenem and
   start flagyl  IV due to deteriorating clinical situation.
   - Will cont caspofungin therapy.
   - Surveillance cultures daily
   - Follow-up culture and sensitivities.
   - Follow fever curve and WBC
   - Follow-up with ID
   - will send sputum, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Volume status contributing to continued vent
   depedence.  Patient was net -121 cc yesterday, although continues to be
   +7 liters LOS.  Renal function appears to be worsening with increase in
   creatinine to 2.1 this AM and oxygen requirement is increasing.
   - will hold lasix gtt and give 1U pRBC, then will reassess volume
   status
   - Goal balance is neg 1 liter, but will attempt to cont to diurese
   after 1U pRBC.
   - PM chemistries
   .
   #Tachycardia: Pt has been tachy into the 130-140 this AM.  EKG shows
   sinus tach.  Possible early sepsis, but pt is afebrile and on broad
   spectrum abx. Pt with low platelets and INR was 1.5 previous, pt sats
   >95%, unlikely PE.  Hemodynamically stable.  Pt has been net positve
   since admission unlikely hypovolemic. Pt anemic with Hct 24.  Likely
   intravascularly depleted.
   - will hold lasix ggt, until after blood
   - will transfuse 1U pRBC
   - will adjust antibiotics to meropenem and flagyl
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: CT abdomen/pelvis yesterday with signs of
   hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at
   this point. Patient not on significant meds that would lead to biliary
   cholestasis, although biliary cholestasis unlikely to lead to this
   level of hyperbilirubinemia.
   - Trend LFTS, bilirubin
   .
   #Elevated Amylase:  Pt with h/o pancreatitis this admission that had
   since resolved.  Elevated amylase this AM and increasing lipase (wnl,
   however).  CT abd did not show change in pancreas from previous.  Will
   d/c propofol, monitor pancreatic enzymes check PM, hold TF for now.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na this AM 147. Patient receiving free water boluses
   through OG.
   - Switched IV meds to D5 if possible to reduce free water through TF
   and overall volume intake.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Patient afebrile overnight with two known sources
   of infection with VRE and C. diff.
   - Continue neupogen
   - Continue acyclovir prophylaxis.
   .
   # FEN: Post-pyloric OGT in place.  CT abdomen without signs of
   perforation or obstruction.  Patient with multiple watery bowel
   movements overnight, unclear if this is leakage around obstruction.
   C.diff negative x2.
   - Hold TF [**12-18**] to increased enzymes
   - Continue reglan, lactulose, senokot, colace
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely in setting of recent reinduction.
   - Transfuse for hct<21 or plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
   - Recheck CBC this afternoon
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.  Less likely to be DIC as
   fibrinogen has been >800.
   - Monitor coags
   .
   # C. Diff: Continue PO vanco
   .
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a past medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and he is now septic with positive blood cultures for VRE since August 21st. He has multiple comorbidities including malnutrition, peripheral edema, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, bacteremia, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis, and his clinical situation is deteriorating. There is a need to change empiric antibiotics to meropenem and start Flagyl IV. Continuous monitoring of fever curve and white blood cell count is required.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is contributing to continued ventilator dependence. The volume status is contributing to this issue, and there is an increase in creatinine levels. The goal balance is negative 1 liter, and diuresis will be attempted after transfusing packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

3. Tachycardia: The patient has been tachycardic with a heart rate between 130-140 beats per minute. Sinus tachycardia is shown on the EKG. Possible early"

   Assessment and Plan
   38F with prolonged neutropenia and general clinical decline over past
   week in regards to respiratory failure and persistent VRE bacteremia.
   1) ID: VRE Bacteremia, felt due to line infection initially, last
   positive cultures were from [**8-21**].  She is hemodynamically stable;
   however febrile this morning and tachycardia is worsening.  Will
   discuss with ID regarding altering coverage
 likely change from
   cefepime in case of gram negative and possible expand to include
   anaerobic coverage.
   - Continues on linezolid for her VRE.
   - For her prolonged neutropenia, she remains on caspo/cefepime; as well
   as prophylactic acyclovir
   - check cultures today
   2) Respiratory Failure: hypoxemic related to volume overload now
   - Would aim for diuresis, though unable to keep negative because of
   3) Renal:  Cr is rising, though she has not been significantly TBB
   negative.  Will hold on lasix for now with rising Cr/tachycardia could
   be related to intravascular volume depletion.
   - D/c lasix gtt for now, but if appears to be TBB+ this afternoon and
   Cr stable, will consider dose of IV lasix +- diuril this afternoon.
   - f/u lytes today
   4) Heme:  HCT slightly lower than baseline
   - will transfuse 1 unit PRBC today
   5) Neuro:  she is currently on propofol.  Given rising lipase, will d/c
   propofol and change to fentanyl/versed.
   - assess mental status today with awakening.
   6) GI:  Slight rise in lipase
   - Will hold enteral feeds for today and recheck tomorrow

The patient is a 38-year-old female with prolonged neutropenia and a general clinical decline over the past week. She is experiencing respiratory failure and persistent VRE bacteremia. The patient remains hemodynamically stable but is febrile this morning, and her tachycardia is worsening. She has been on multiple antibiotics, including linezolid for VRE, cefepime, caspofungin, and acyclovir for prophylaxis. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lipase levels. Her serum creatinine (Cr) is rising, and she has a history of renal insufficiency. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and receiving propofol for sedation. She is also receiving IV fluids and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has persistent VRE bacteremia, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could progress, leading to worsening hypoxemia and the need for increased ventilatory support.
3. Renal Insufficiency: The rising serum creatinine levels indicate renal insufficiency, which can worsen and result in acute kidney injury.
4. Neurological Complications:"

   Assessment and Plan
   38F with prolonged neutropenia and general clinical decline over past
   week in regards to respiratory failure and persistent VRE bacteremia.
   1) ID: VRE Bacteremia, felt due to line infection initially, last
   positive cultures were from [**8-21**].  She is hemodynamically stable;
   however febrile this morning and tachycardia is worsening.  Will
   discuss with ID regarding altering coverage
 likely change from
   cefepime in case of gram negative and possible expand to include
   anaerobic coverage.
   - Continues on linezolid for her VRE.
   - For her prolonged neutropenia, she remains on caspo/cefepime; as well
   as prophylactic acyclovir
   - check cultures today
   2) Respiratory Failure: hypoxemic related to volume overload now
   - Would aim for diuresis, though unable to keep negative because of
   3) Renal:  Cr is rising, though she has not been significantly TBB
   negative.  Will hold on lasix for now with rising Cr/tachycardia could
   be related to intravascular volume depletion.
   - D/c lasix gtt for now, but if appears to be TBB+ this afternoon and
   Cr stable, will consider dose of IV lasix +- diuril this afternoon.
   - f/u lytes today
   4) Heme:  HCT slightly lower than baseline
   - will transfuse 1 unit PRBC today
   -remains profoundly neutropenic
   5) Neuro:  she is currently on propofol.  Given rising lipase, will d/c
   propofol and change to fentanyl/versed.
   - assess mental status today with awakening.
   6) GI:  Slight rise in lipase
   - Will hold enteral feeds for today and recheck tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a clinical decline over the past week. She has prolonged neutropenia and is experiencing respiratory failure with persistent VRE bacteremia. Her vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. She has been on various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. Her lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels, rising potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is also showing signs of fluid overload and is currently receiving diuretics. She has anemia and is profoundly neutropenic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening due to hypoxemia related to volume overload. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern about the potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has persistent VRE bacteremia, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating renal dysfunction. This could progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) if not managed appropriately.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's potassium levels are increasing, which may lead to hyperkalemia. Close monitoring and management of electrolytes are necessary.

5. Fluid Overload: The patient is showing signs of fluid overload, which can"

   38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology with recent PEA arrest.
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis.  Last positve
   VRE blood cultures are from [**8-21**].  Both the arterial line and CVL have
   been removed and midline is in place and working properly.  The
   patients abx were changed yesterday from cefepime to meropenem because
   pt was tachy and had low grade temp.  Addtionally,  IV flagyl was added
   for anerobe coverage and c. diff colitis coverage. Pt's tachycardia has
   resolved and afebrile.  Pt is however clinically deteriorating.
   - Will continue linezolid for 2 weeks after last negative culture
   - Continue empiric meropenem and caspofungin
   - Cont  flagyl  IV
   - Surveillance cultures daily
   - Follow-up culture and sensitivities.
   - Follow-up with ID
   - f/u send sputum, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Volume status contributing to continued vent
   depedence.  Patient fluid balance was positve 700 in the last 24grs.
   The patient's renal function is worsening after aggressive diuresis.
   Pt still had good urine output.  Creatinine increased to 2.4 and lasix
   gtt was held.  Pt respiratory status no improvement.  Pt appeared
   dysynchonous on the vent last night and her RR was increased to 30 and
   tidal volume was increased to 500.
   - recheck ABG
   - will hold lasix gtt given pancreatitis, then will reassess volume
   status
   - Goal balance is neg 500cc
   - PM chemistries.
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: CT abdomen/pelvis yesterday with signs of
   hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at
   this point. Could be cholestasis although unlikely to lead to this
   level of hyperbilirubinemia.  Progessive worsening.
   - Trend LFTS, bilirubin
   .
   #Elevated Amylase:  Pt with h/o pancreatitis this admission that had
   since resolved.  Continued elevated pancreatic enzymes .  CT abd did
   not show change in pancreas from previous.  Discontinued propofol and
   TF yesterday,
   - monitor pancreatic enzymes
   - hold TF for now.
   - hold on additional fluids given patient is receiving IV fluids via
   meds and has been net positive
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na this AM 143. Patient receiving free water boluses
   through OG.  Free water deficit essentially corrected. . Switched IV
   meds to D5 if possible to reduce free water through TF and overall
   volume intake.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Patient afebrile overnight with two known sources
   of infection with VRE and C. diff.
   - Continue neupogen
   - Continue acyclovir prophylaxis.
   .
   # FEN: Post-pyloric OGT in place.  CT abdomen without signs of
   perforation or obstruction.  Patient with multiple watery bowel
   movements, C.diff negative x2. Rectal bag inplace
   - Hold TF [**12-18**] to increased pancreatic enzymes
   - Continue reglan, lactulose, senokot, colace
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely in setting of recent reinduction.  Pt received
   1U pRBC and 1U plts yesterday.
   - Transfuse for hct<21 or plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
   - Recheck CBC this afternoon
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.  Less likely to be DIC as
   fibrinogen has been >800.
   - Monitor coags
   .
   # C. Diff: Continue PO vanco and added IV flagyl (pt with decreased gut
   motility)
   .
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.  BM biopsy has minimal benefit to management

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that require attention. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) sepsis, which is a serious bloodstream infection caused by the bacteria Enterococcus. The patient's clinical deterioration indicates a worsening condition.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The volume status is contributing to continued ventilator dependence. The patient's renal function is also worsening after aggressive diuresis, and there is an increased creatinine level.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, specifically with VRE, indicating the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. This is a concerning finding and requires appropriate antibiotic treatment.

4. C. difficile infection: The patient has a C. difficile infection, which is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This infection can lead to severe colitis and may require specific treatment.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, characterized by a decrease in kidney function. The elevated creatinine level indicates impaired renal function.

6. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which could be due to liver dysfunction or biliary pathology. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

7. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes, indicating pancreatitis. This condition requires monitoring and"

   - Continues on linezolid for her VRE.
   - Now on meropenem/cefepime
   - Caspofungin
   - Acyclovir prophylaxis
   2) Respiratory Failure: hypoxemic related to volume overload now
   - Would aim for diuresis, though unable to keep negative because of
   rising creatinine.
   - Also concern for VAP now with secretions/infiltrates.
   - Continue current ventilator management.
   3) Renal:  Cr is rising, though she has not been significantly TBB
   negative.  Will hold on lasix for now with rising Cr/tachycardia could
   be related to intravascular volume depletion.
   - hold lasix today
   - Trend lytes
   4) Heme:  HCT slightly lower than baseline
   - will transfuse 1 unit PRBC today
   -remains profoundly neutropenic
   5) GI:  Rising LFTs/amylase/lipase
   - Continue to hold amylase/lipase
   - Now off propofol in favor of fentanyl/versed
   6) CV- HTN:  BP now increased off propofol.
   - Start labetalol drip

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 366**] is a 38-year-old female patient who has been experiencing a gradual decline in health. She has a low-grade temperature, which led to a change in her antibiotic regimen. Her creatinine levels continue to rise despite being off lasix. Propofol was stopped due to her becoming hypertensive and agitated, but she remains encephalopathic. Fentanyl/versed were restarted, and she was given hydralazine for elevated blood pressure.

Medical Complications:
1) ID: VRE Bacteremia - The patient has an infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Recent sputum culture revealed yeast, so expanded coverage was initiated. She is currently on linezolid for VRE and meropenem/cefepime for bacterial infection.
2) Respiratory Failure - The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with increased secretions and infiltrates on chest X-ray.
3) Renal Failure - The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating possible renal failure. Lasix, a diuretic, has been held due to rising creatinine and tachycardia, which could be related to intravascular volume depletion.
4) Anemia - The patient's hemoglobin concentration is slightly lower than baseline, leading to plans for a transfusion of one"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 366**] continues to gradually decline with little evidence of
   improvement.  Given her low grade temperature yesterday, her antibiotic
   regimen was changed.  Her creatinine continues to climb despite being
   off the lasix.  Her propofol was stopped yesterday, and she became
   hypertensive and agitated.  However, no noted purposeful movements or
   activity; she remained encephalpathic.  Fentanyl/versed were
   restarted.  She was given hydralazine for elevated BP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of penicillin allergy, aspirin allergy, and unknown reactions to omeprazole. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including cefipime, caspofungin, linezolid, metronidazole, acyclovir, vancomycin, and meropenem. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 192/122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 50%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,533 mL and output of 3,825 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 708 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, hydralazine, hydromorphone, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, with slightly low potassium and sodium levels. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on 08/27/2135 at 11:45 AM, urine culture on 08/27/2135 at 11:45 AM, sputum culture on 08/27/2135 at 12:30 PM, and stool culture on 08/27/2135 at 12:30 PM. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were administered on 08/28/2135 at various times. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to the presence of multiple antibiotic-resistant organisms and the prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, and stool culture can help identify any potential infectious agents.
2. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea: Given the patient's allergies to certain antibiotics and the use of multiple antibiotics, there is a risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, particularly with the use of metronidazole.
3. Medication errors: With the complex medication regimen, there is a potential for medication errors, which can lead to adverse drug reactions or therapeutic failures.
4. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility and use of mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): Immobility and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia.
7. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction, which may be exacerbated by the use"

   38 yo W with PMH of relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with febrile
   neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia and possible
   tamponade physiology with recent PEA arrest.
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis.  Last positve
   VRE blood cultures are from [**8-21**].  Both the arterial line and CVL have
   been removed and midline is in place and working properly.  The
   patients abx were changed yesterday from cefepime to meropenem because
   pt was tachy and had low grade temp.  Addtionally,  IV flagyl was added
   for anerobe coverage and c. diff colitis coverage. Pt's tachycardia has
   resolved and afebrile.  Pt is however clinically deteriorating.
   - Will continue linezolid for 2 weeks after last negative culture
   - Continue empiric meropenem and caspofungin
   - Cont  flagyl  IV
   - Surveillance cultures daily
   - Follow-up culture and sensitivities.
   - Follow-up with ID
   - f/u send sputum, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Volume status contributing to continued vent
   depedence.  Patient fluid balance was positve 700 in the last 24grs.
   The patient's renal function is worsening after aggressive diuresis.
   Pt still had good urine output.  Creatinine increased to 2.4 and lasix
   gtt was held.  Pt respiratory status no improvement.  Pt appeared
   dysynchonous on the vent last night and her RR was increased to 30 and
   tidal volume was increased to 500.
   - recheck ABG
   - will hold lasix gtt, then will reassess volume status
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: CT abdomen/pelvis yesterday with signs of
   hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at
   this point. Could be cholestasis although unlikely to lead to this
   level of hyperbilirubinemia.  Progessive worsening.
   - Trend LFTS, bilirubin
   .
   #Elevated Amylase:  Pt with h/o pancreatitis this admission that had
   since resolved.  Continued elevated pancreatic enzymes .  CT abd did
   not show change in pancreas from previous.  Discontinued propofol and
   TF yesterday,
   - monitor pancreatic enzymes
   - hold TF for now.
   - hold on additional fluids given patient is receiving IV fluids via
   meds and has been net positive
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Na this AM 138.   Corrected.  Patient receiving free
   water boluses through OG.  Will decrease flushes q4.  Switched IV meds
   to D5 if possible to reduce free water through TF and overall volume
   intake.
   .
   # Neutropenic fever: Patient afebrile overnight with two known sources
   of infection with VRE and C. diff.
   - Continue neupogen
   - Continue acyclovir prophylaxis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), currently undergoing chemotherapy. She was admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She is now septic with VRE and C. difficile infections. Her respiratory failure is due to fluid overload and ventilator dependence. The patient has hyperbilirubinemia, elevated amylase levels, hypernatremia, neutropenic fever, and pancytopenia. She also has a history of pancreatitis. The patient requires continued aggressive treatment, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. She is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple organ dysfunctions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has not improved despite increased tidal volume and respiratory rate. There is a concern for ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level. Aggressive diuresis has been held due to positive fluid balance.
3. Hepatobiliary Pathology: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which may be due to hepatobiliary pathology. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Pancreatitis: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. He also had signs of tamponade physiology and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient continues to deteriorate clinically and has been on mechanical ventilation. He has positive sputum cultures for yeast and is being treated with caspofungin. 

The patient's respiratory status has not improved despite volume resuscitation, and his renal function is worsening with a creatinine level of 2.9. He also has hyperbilirubinemia, elevated amylase, and hypernatremia. The patient has neutropenic fever, C. difficile infection, and pancytopenia. He is planned for a bone marrow transplant if he becomes medically stable, extubated, and has functional status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's continued dependence on mechanical ventilation indicates ongoing respiratory failure. The positive fluid balance suggests volume overload, which needs to be addressed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, indicating the possibility of acute kidney injury.
3. Hepatobiliary Pathology: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels and signs of hepatobiliary pathology seen on CT abdomen/pel"

   Assessment and Plan
   38F with prolonged neutropenia and general clinical decline over past
   week in regards to respiratory failure and  VRE bacteremia.
   1) ID: VRE Bacteremia, felt due to line infection initially, last
   positive cultures were from [**8-21**] with negative surviellance cultures.
   She is hemodynamically stable.  Recent sputum culture with yeast;
   expanded coverage yesterday.  Does have increased secretions and CXR
   with interval increasing effusion vs. infiltrate
   - Continues on linezolid for her VRE.
   - Now on meropenem for possible VAP (was previously on cefepime)
   - Caspofungin
   - Acyclovir prophylaxis
   - PO vancomycin for cdiff colitis
   2) Respiratory Failure: hypoxemic related to volume overload now
   7.42/42/90
   - Would aim for diuresis, though unable to keep negative because of
   rising creatinine.
   - Also concern for VAP now with secretions/infiltrates.
   - Continue current ventilator management.
   3) Renal:  Cr is rising, though she has not been significantly TBB
   negative.  Will hold on lasix with rising Cr/tachycardia could be
   related to intravascular volume depletion.
   - hold lasix
   - Trend lytes
   4) Heme:  HCT slightly lower than baseline, pancytopenic
   - Transfuse one unit PRBC today
   -remains profoundly neutropenic, on neupogen
   5) GI:  Rising LFTs/amylase/lipase, bilirubin
   - Continue to hold amylase/lipase
   - Now off propofol in favor of fentanyl/versed
   6) CV- HTN:  BP now increased off propofol.
   - Labetolol drip for BP control
   7) Neuro:  Minimally responsive on sedation.  Whenever sedation weaned,
   becomes more hypertensive and bites the ETT.
   - Continue fentanyl/versed, try to awaken daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with multiple medical complications. He has been in the ICU since 8/22/2135 and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin, amoxicillin, and omeprazole. He has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (92/59 mmHg) and a high heart rate (94 bpm). His temperature is slightly low at 35.2°C (95.3°F), but within normal range. His respiratory rate is controlled at 25 breaths per minute, and he has a SpO2 of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,926 mL and output of 959 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood products transfused amount to 200 mL and 497 mL.

The patient's lab results indicate low white blood cell count (WBC) at 0.1 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 21.0% to 26.8%, low platelet count (Plt) ranging from 7 to 90 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels between 2.1 and 2.9 mg/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 978 IU/L. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests are also abnormal.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several medical conditions including malnutrition, peripheral edema, pancytopenia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, altered mental status, and acute leukemia.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, central venous and arterial lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to the patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation and the presence of bacteremia. The patient's low blood pressure and high heart rate may indicate possible hypovolemia or septic shock. The pancytopenia could lead to increased risk of bleeding or infection. The acute renal failure suggests impaired kidney function, which may require dialysis. The presence of C. difficile infection could lead to severe colitis and further complications. The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium or coma if not addressed properly. Lastly, the acute leukemia may require specific oncologic intervention."

   Assessment and Plan
   38F with prolonged neutropenia and general clinical decline over past
   week in regards to respiratory failure and  VRE bacteremia.
   1) ID: VRE Bacteremia, felt due to line infection initially, last
   positive cultures were from [**8-21**] with negative surviellance cultures.
   She is hemodynamically stable.  Recent sputum culture with yeast;
   expanded coverage yesterday.  Does have increased secretions and CXR
   with interval increasing effusion vs. infiltrate
   - Continues on linezolid for her VRE.
   - Now on meropenem for possible VAP (was previously on cefepime)
   - Caspofungin
   - Acyclovir prophylaxis
   - PO vancomycin for cdiff colitis
   2) Respiratory Failure: hypoxemic related to volume overload now
   7.42/42/90
   - Would aim for diuresis, though unable to keep negative because of
   rising creatinine.
   - Also concern for VAP now with secretions/infiltrates.
   - Continue current ventilator management.
   3) Renal:  Cr is rising, though she has not been significantly TBB
   negative.  Will hold on lasix with rising Cr/tachycardia could be
   related to intravascular volume depletion.
   - hold lasix
   - Trend lytes
   4) Heme:  HCT slightly lower than baseline, pancytopenic
   - Transfuse one unit PRBC today
   -remains profoundly neutropenic, on neupogen
   5) GI:  Rising LFTs/amylase/lipase, bilirubin
   - Continue to hold amylase/lipase
   - Now off propofol in favor of fentanyl/versed
   6) CV- HTN:  BP now increased off propofol.
   - Labetolol drip for BP control
   7) Neuro:  Minimally responsive on sedation.  Whenever sedation weaned,
   becomes more hypertensive and bites the ETT.
   - Continue fentanyl/versed, try to awaken daily
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Start trophic feeds today and follow amylase/lipase for
   pancreatitis

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) status post chemotherapy, febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology with recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is experiencing multiple complications.

The patient has sepsis, likely due to VRE bacteremia. He is also suffering from acute respiratory failure, which may not be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by an increasing creatinine level of 3.4 mg/dL. He also has pancytopenia, which could be related to recent chemotherapy treatment.

The patient has an altered mental status, possibly due to sepsis or other factors. He has a history of pancreatitis and elevated amylase levels. His bilirubin levels are also elevated, with no clear cause identified yet. The patient is hypernatremic, and his sodium level needs to be corrected.

The patient is neutropenic with febrile neutropenia, and he is currently on antibiotics prophylaxis. He has a post-pyloric feeding tube in place and is experiencing watery bowel movements, although Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out twice. The patient's co"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia, and possible tamponade physiology. He had a recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to respiratory failure. He has ongoing sepsis with VRE, C. difficile infection, acute renal failure, and malnutrition. Other medical conditions include peripheral edema, pancytopenia, altered mental status, and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off sedation has not resulted in spontaneous movements or reaction to pain, indicating a possible prolonged weaning process or need for tracheostomy.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by the increasing creatinine level of 3.4. This may require dialysis, with the family discussing the option of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) versus hemodialysis (HD).
3. Sepsis: The patient continues to have sepsis with VRE bacteremia. It is crucial to monitor his response to the current antibiotics and consider further interventions if there is no improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade. He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) due to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's condition has deteriorated clinically, and he remains neutropenic with ongoing VRE sepsis. His arterial line and central venous line (CVL) have been removed, and a midline catheter has been placed. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure with worsening renal function and an elevated creatinine level of 4.3. Renal consultation was sought, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) via continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is planned. The patient's respiratory status has not improved, and he continues to be dependent on mechanical ventilation.

The patient is also suffering from anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperbilirubinemia without evidence of hepatobiliary pathology, and elevated amylase levels. He has a history of pancreatitis but currently does not exhibit any signs of pancreatic inflammation. The patient is neutropenic fever-free at the moment but has two known sources of infection with VRE and Clostridium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, VRE bacteremia, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient experienced a recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and has been in the ICU since then. The patient continues to deteriorate clinically and has several ongoing medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is neutropenic with VRE sepsis, but no new positive blood cultures have been identified since August 21st. The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including caspofungin for yeast in the sputum.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, with a creatinine level of 4.3. Renal consultation has been obtained, and the plan is to initiate continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with the placement of an interventional radiology (IR) dialysis catheter.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been off sedation since August 29th but shows little to no spontaneous movements. The patient's respiratory status has not improved, and fluid overload is contributing to continued ventilator dependence.
4. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap acidosis likely due to uremia, with a lactate level of 1.6. There"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, pancreatitis, and possible tamponade physiology. The patient has been in the ICU since [**8-29**] and has had multiple complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient remains neutropenic with VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) sepsis. Recent blood cultures grew GPC pairs and clusters, but the midline catheter was removed yesterday. There is a possibility of contamination given only one set positive and previous cultures negative. The last positive VRE blood cultures were from [**8-21**]. The patient continues to clinically deteriorate. Sputum is growing yeast, and the patient is on caspofungin. Negative urine and stool cultures were obtained. 

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with an output of approximately 100-200 cc/hr and is tolerating it well. The patient is oliguric, but renal function has improved with a creatinine level of 3.2. Dialysis will be placed by interventional radiology (IR) yesterday. Acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, including acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been admitted to the ICU. He is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anion gap acidosis, C. difficile infection, altered mental status, leukemia, and pancytopenia. He is also showing signs of malnutrition, peripheral edema, and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with recent positive blood cultures indicating a possible VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) infection. He has been placed on various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is neutropenic with ongoing VRE sepsis, and there is a concern for possible contamination given the positive blood culture from the midline catheter.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and has not shown significant improvement in his respiratory status.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal function and is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH). There may be multifactorial causes for his renal failure, including PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. He has a history of malignancy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including malnutrition, peripheral edema, pancytopenia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, altered mental status, and acute leukemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced urine output. This increases the risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.

3. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteremia suggests an ongoing infection. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction.

4. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. This may lead to fluid loss, electrolyte imbalances, and worsening malnutrition.

5. Leukemia: The diagnosis of acute leukemia indicates a hematological malignancy. It is important to monitor the patient's blood counts and manage any complications related to"

   of 18).  Pt on ventilator and with a respiratory alkalosis.
   - t/c decreasing RR, but pt was dysynchronous when rate was deceased
   previously
   - will monitor chem-7
   - will correct uremia with CVVH
   .
   # Papular Rash: Pt with papular rash on forehead. Nursing noted on arms
   and legs, but since resolved.  Could be reaction to dialysis fluid or
   other medication, but no new antibiotcs or meds started.  Does not
   appear to be zoster, but is on the V1 dermatome.   Will cont to

   # Hyperbilirubinemia: CT abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not show signs
   of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology
   at this point. TBili trending up again.  Could be combination of
   cholestasis, sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Trend LFTS, bilirubin

   #Elevated Amylase:  Pt with h/o pancreatitis this admission that had
   since resolved. Pancreatic enzymes essentiall unchanged.  CT abd did
   not show change in pancreas from previous.  Discontinued propofol.
   Restarted TF and tolerating.
   - monitor pancreatic enzymes

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who is currently experiencing multiple complications. He has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, pancreatitis, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology with recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient continues to deteriorate clinically.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Sepsis: The patient remains neutropenic with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) sepsis. New positive blood cultures growing GPC pairs and clusters from the midline were removed yesterday. Possible contamination is suspected given only one set of positive cultures and previous negative cultures. The patient will be monitored for any changes in blood cultures and sensitivities. Empiric meropenem, flagyl, and caspofungin will be continued.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient started continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is tolerating it well. His renal function has improved, with a creatinine level of 3.2 today. A dialysis catheter will be placed by interventional radiology (IR) yesterday. Acute renal failure is likely multifactorial due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), previous PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently in the ICU for various medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) sepsis, febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, pancreatitis, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology with a recent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis. New positive blood cultures growing enterococcus from the midline (midline was removed) indicate persistent VRE bacteremia. The patient is on caspofungin for fungal infection, and negative urine and stool cultures suggest no other infections.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is tolerating it well. The patient remains oliguric, but renal function has improved with a creatinine level of 2.3. CVVH has removed 4L of fluid yesterday, and renal services will start hemodialysis (HD) today. The cause of acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, including PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure.

","The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), currently undergoing chemotherapy. She presents with multiple comorbidities, including VRE sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, C. difficile infection, altered mental status, and pancytopenia.

Assessment:
1. VRE Sepsis: The patient has persistent VRE bacteremia despite previous treatment. New positive blood cultures indicate ongoing infection. She will continue to receive linezolid for 2 weeks after the last negative culture and empiric meropenem, flagyl, and caspofungin.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving, with a decrease in creatinine levels. She is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and will start hemodialysis (HD) today. The cause of acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, including PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been extubated since August 29th and is now on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Her respiratory status remains stable, but she still requires ventilatory support due to volume overload.
4. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's acidosis has corrected after CVVH. She will continue to be monitored for chem-7 and dialysis.

   continued VRE bacteremia, continued neutropenia.
   1.       ID:  VRE bacteremia, most recent positive blood culture on
   [**8-27**].  History of cdiff on flagyl.  Covered broadly for possible VAP
   for several days as well as febrile neutropenia.
   -          Continue linezolid for VRE
   -          Meropenem for VAP
 plan for 8 day course given negative
   cultures and can discuss with ID changing GN coverage
   -          PO vancomycin/ Flagyl for cdiff colitis
 continue while
   neutropenic and on other antibiotics
   -          Caspofungin empirically
   -          Acyclovir prophylaxis
   2.       Respiratory Failure:  Hypoxemic.  Related to volume overload
   most likely.  She is also covered for VAP. FiO2 0.6/PEEP 10.
   -          Increase PEEP today to decrease FiO2
 would increase PEEP
   to 12, to aim FiO2 .5 or 0.4.
   3.       Neuro:  improving off sedation and improvement in uremia.
   Slightly more responsive today.
   -          continue to hold sedation
   -          monitor neuro status
   4.       Renal:  ARF multifactorial.  Tolerating CVVH.
   -          Changing to HD today, continue aggressive volume removal
   5.       GI:  mild increase in Amylase/lipase today.  LFTs continue to
   be abnormal with no evidence of biliar obstruction.
   -          On low lipid TPN, follow amylase/lipase
   6.       Heme:  HCT< 21 and Platelets < 10 as transfusion goals per

The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) who has been neutropenic since [**6-24**]. She is currently in the ICU due to PEA arrest, VRE bacteremia, and gross body overload caused by renal failure and hypoalbuminemia. The patient tolerated CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) yesterday and is planning to switch to HD (hemodialysis) today. She has also started on TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and had her NGT (nasogastric tube) removed due to migration.

Medical Complications:
1. ID (Infectious Disease): The patient has VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) bacteremia. She is currently being covered for possible VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) as well as febrile neutropenia. The plan includes continuing linezolid for VRE, meropenem for VAP, and discussing with ID changing GN coverage.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is most likely due to volume overload. She is being covered for VAP and the FiO2 is set at 0.6 with a PEEP of 10. The goal is to increase PEEP to 12 to decrease FiO2 to 0.5 or 0.4.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 38-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). She has been experiencing multiple acute issues, including renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia. The patient is also neutropenic and has a history of Clostridium difficile infection on Flagyl.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure of 182/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%.

The patient has undergone continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is planned to be changed to hemodialysis (HD) today. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids and has had removal of her nasogastric tube due to migration.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin and platelet levels, elevated creatinine and lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Her electrolyte levels are within normal"

   for several days as well as febrile neutropenia.
   -          Continue linezolid for VRE
   -          Meropenem for VAP
 plan for 8 day course given negative
   cultures and can discuss with ID changing GN coverage

   -          Acyclovir prophylaxis
   2.       Respiratory Failure:  Hypoxemic.  Related to volume overload
   most likely.  She is also covered for VAP. FiO2 0.6/PEEP 10.
   -          Increase PEEP today to decrease FiO2
 would increase PEEP
   to 12, to aim FiO2 .5 or 0.4.
   3.       Neuro:  improving off sedation and improvement in uremia.
   Slightly more responsive today.
   -          continue to hold sedation
   -          monitor neuro status
   4.       Renal:  ARF multifactorial.  Tolerating CVVH.
   -          Changing to HD today, continue aggressive volume removal
   5.       GI:  mild increase in Amylase/lipase today.  LFTs continue to
   be abnormal with no evidence of biliar obstruction.
   -          On low lipid TPN, follow amylase/lipase

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with VRE sepsis, febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, pancreatitis, and possible cardiac tamponade. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving multiple interventions including dialysis, PICC line placement, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VRE Sepsis: The patient has persistent VRE bacteremia despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Continuous monitoring of blood cultures and sensitivities is necessary to guide further treatment decisions.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure. Continuous hemodialysis (HD) has been initiated, and ongoing monitoring of renal function is required.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains dependent on mechanical ventilation due to volume status issues. Adjustments in PEEP and FiO2 settings, along with continued fluid removal, are necessary to improve respiratory status.

4. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis has corrected after CVVH, but ongoing monitoring of chem-7 and continuation of dialysis are required to maintain acid-base balance.

5. Papular Rash: The patient presents with a papular rash on the forehead, which is likely contact dermatitis. Monitoring for any progression or development of"

   PGY-2 Addendum:
   Discussed with Interventional Radiology about HD catheter tip in RA.
   Review of radiologic studies reveals that the catheter tip has been in
   the RA since insertion. Per IR, there was no urgent need to pull back.
   Would continue to monitor for arrythmias and consider pulling back if
   patient develops arrythmias.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old male with a medical history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently admitted to the ICU for various complications including VRE sepsis, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, pancreatitis, and possible cardiac tamponade. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis. He has an increasing white blood cell count of 0.2 today, indicating an ongoing infection. The last positive blood cultures were from [**8-27**] growing VRE, and the patient likely has persistent VRE bacteremia. The patient is being treated with linezolid, meropenem, flagyl, and caspofungin. Daily surveillance cultures will be taken, and the patient will be followed up with infectious disease recommendations.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient started on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and switched to hemodialysis (HD) yesterday, tolerating it well. The patient has removed 4 liters of fluid, and his creatinine level has increased to 2.7. The acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, including ATN due to PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. Renal ultrasonography did not show any signs of hydro. The patient"

   culture
   -          Meropenem for VAP
 plan for 8 day course given negative
   cultures and can discuss with ID changing GN coverage
   -          PO vancomycin/ Flagyl for cdiff colitis
 continue while
   neutropenic and on other antibiotics
   -          Caspofungin empirically for neutropenic fever
   -          Acyclovir prophylaxis
   2.       Acute respiratory Failure:
   -          at least in part related to 30+ liter volume overload for
   LOS.  She is also covered for VAP. FiO2 0.5/PEEP 8 currently,
   tolerating. Continue vent support.
   3.      Altered MS - Significantly more responsive today.
   -          continue to hold sedation, minimal morphine
   -          monitor neuro status
   4.       Renal:  ARF multifactorial.  .
   -         Tolerating HD, continue aggressive volume removal
   5.       GI:  mild increase in Amylase/lipase today.  LFTs continue to
   be abnormal with no evidence of biliar obstruction.
   -          On low lipid TPN, follow amylase/lipase, TG
   6.       Heme:  HCT< 21 and Platelets < 10 as transfusion goals per

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogenic bone marrow transplant (allo-BMT). She has been experiencing persistent neutropenia for 6 weeks and is currently in the ICU. The patient's course has been complicated by cdiff colitis, VRE bacteremia, and a previous episode of PEA arrest. She is intubated and on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with fluid removal of 6 liters per day. Her mental status has slightly improved.

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, aspirin, amoxicillin, omeprazole, and unknown reactions to aspirin and omeprazole. She is currently receiving various medications such as caspofungin, linezolid, metronidazole, meropenem, acyclovir, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and filgrastim.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/107 mmHg to 182/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on SIMV/PSV/AutoFlow ventilation mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cm"

   Assessment and Plan
   38F with ALL and multiple acute issues including ARF now on HD,
   continued VRE bacteremia, neutropenia, and altered MS.
   1.        ID:  recurrent VRE bacteremia, most recent positive blood
   culture on [**8-27**].  History of cdiff on flagyl.
   -          Covered broadly for possible VAP for several days as well as
   for ongoing neutropenia.
   -          Continue linezolid for VRE x 2 weeks from last negative
   culture
   -          Meropenem for VAP
 plan for 8 day course given negative
   cultures and can discuss with ID changing GN coverage
   -          PO flagyl for cdiff colitis
 continue while neutropenic and
   on other antibiotics
   -          Caspofungin empirically for neutropenic fever
   -          Acyclovir prophylaxis
   2.        Acute respiratory Failure:
   -          at least in part related to 30+ liter volume overload for
   LOS.  She is also covered for VAP.
   -          on FiO2 0.5/PEEP 8 currently, tolerating. Continue vent
   support. Will likely improve with volume removal
   3.       Altered MS - Significantly more responsive today.
   -          continue to hold sedation, minimal effective morphine dose
   for discomfort
   -          monitor neuro status closely
   4.       Renal:  ARF multifactorial.
   -         Tolerating HD, continue aggressive volume removal
   5.        GI:  LFTs continue to be abnormal with no evidence of biliary
   obstruction.
   -          On low lipid TPN, follow amylase/lipase, TG
   6.       Heme:  HCT< 21 and Platelets < 10 as transfusion goals per
   oncology

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has undergone allogenic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). She has been experiencing persistent neutropenia for six weeks and has developed complications such as cdiff colitis, VRE bacteremia, and PEA arrest. The patient is currently intubated and on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with fluid removal of 6 liters per day. Her mental status has slightly improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent VRE bacteremia: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia, and there is a risk of recurrence. The current plan includes continuing linezolid for VRE for an additional two weeks from the last negative culture.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is covered for VAP due to her acute respiratory failure. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, including a dialysis catheter and a PICC line. There is a risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection, which should be monitored closely.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute respiratory failure and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). There is a risk of AKI, and the patient's renal function should"

   # Elevated amylase: Pt with h/o pancreatitis this admission that had
   since resolved. Lipase trending downwards. Currently on TPN.
   - Monitor pancreatic enzymes
   - Cont TPN for now and monitor enzymes
   - Hold TF
   # Neutropenic fever: Patient afebrile overnight with two known sources
   of infection with VRE and C. diff.
   - Continue neupogen
   - Continue acyclovir prophylaxis.
   # Pancytopenia: Likely in setting of recent reinduction.
   - Transfuse for hct<21 or plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.

","The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, pancreatitis, and possible cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient had a recent perioperative arrest and has been intubated since August 27th.

The patient continues to be neutropenic with Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. He has been on continuous hemofiltration (CVVH) since September 1st and switched to hemodialysis (HD) on September 2nd, tolerating well with removal of 5.5 kg of fluid. The patient remains oliguric with a rising creatinine level of 3.3. Acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by the cardiopulmonary arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. Renal ultrasound shows no hydro.

The patient's respiratory failure has improved with weaning off sedation since August 29th. However, the patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to volume overload. The plan is to increase positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and decrease fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Hemodialysis will be continued to address fluid overload.

Anion-gap acidosis has resolved after dialysis. The patient's hyperbilirubinemia"

   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with VRE sepsis.  Pt with
   increasing WBC count to 0.3 today.  Last positve blood cultures one set
   from [**8-27**] growing VRE from midline (midline was removed).  Pt likely
   has persisent VRE bacteremia. The last previous positive VRE blood
   cultures are from [**8-21**].  Dialysis and PICC line were placed [**8-31**]. Pt
   clinically improving.
   - Continue to monitor surveillance cultures
   - Will continue linezolid for 2 weeks after last negative culture
   (pending new positve blood cx)
        - Discuss with ID possibility of changing from linezolid to
   daptomycin given that linezolid causes bone marrow suppression
   - Continue empiric meropenem, flagyl and caspofungin
   - Daily surveillance cultures, culture if spikes
   - f/u with ID recs if any
   # Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH ([**9-1**]) and switched to HD on
   [**9-2**]; tolerating well.  Removed 5.5kg of fluid. Pt cont to be
   oliguric.  Cr increased to 3.3. ARF likely multifactorial ATN given PEA
   arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. Renal U/S no
   hydro.
   - Cont HD on Monday
   - f/u renal recs
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. Pt able to squeeze hands, shake head
   since [**9-2**].  Volume status contributing to continued vent depedence.
   Pt on HD with significant fluid removal daily.  Pt respiratory status
   stable, but some agitation with no sedation. ETT 1-2 cm too high today
 will adjust positioning.
   - Currently on SIMV and tolerating well

   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Does not appear to be zoster and is stable.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Improving with TBili 2.8 today.  CT
   abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not show signs of hepatobiliary
   pathology causing elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at this point.
   Could be combination of cholestasis, sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Transaminitis nearly resolved
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   # Elevated amylase: Pt with h/o pancreatitis this admission that had
   since resolved. Lipase trending downwards. Currently on TPN.
   - Monitor pancreatic enzymes
   - Continue TPN
   - TF restarted, trophic feeds
   # Neutropenic fever: Patient afebrile overnight with two known sources
   of infection with VRE and C. diff.
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue meropenem, flagyl IV, vancomycin PO, acyclovir, and
   caspofungin
   # Pancytopenia: Likely in setting of recent reinduction.
   - Transfuse for hct<21 or plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco and IV flagyl (pt with decreased gut motility)
   will need for 2 weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.

The patient is a 38-year-old male with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who presented with febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, pancreatitis, and possible cardiac tamponade. The patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was intubated due to respiratory failure. He has been on mechanical ventilation since then.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple complications including sepsis with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), acute renal failure, respiratory failure, C. difficile infection, altered mental status, and pancytopenia. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with some improvements and ongoing management of various medical issues.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilatory support. The patient's weight has decreased from 92 kg at admission to 69.2 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 14, elevated creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL, and altered liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within"

   Assessment and Plan
   38 yr old with ALL s/p prep for allo-BMT, persistent 6 weeks of
   neutropenia
   Course complicated by cdiff colitis, VRE bacteremia, PEA arrest
   Intubated. CVVH started [**8-31**] with fluid removal - 6L/24 hrs, now on HD
   38F with ALL and multiple acute issues including ARF now on HD,
   continued VRE bacteremia, neutropenia, and altered MS.
   1.        ID:  recurrent VRE bacteremia, most recent positive blood
   culture on [**8-27**].  History of cdiff on flagyl.
   -          Covered broadly for possible VAP for several days as well as
   for ongoing neutropenia.
   -          Continue linezolid for VRE x 2 weeks from last negative
   culture, will ask ID about restarting Daptomycin
   -          Received 8 days of Meropenem for VAP
 can discuss with ID
   changing or disontinuing GN coverage
   -          PO flagyl for cdiff colitis
 continue while neutropenic and
   on other antibiotics
   -          Caspofungin empirically for neutropenic fever
   -          Acyclovir prophylaxis
   2.        Acute respiratory Failure:
   -          at least in part related to 25+ liter volume overload for
   LOS.  She was treated for VAP.
   -          on FiO2 0.5/PEEP 8/PS 14 currently, tolerating. Continues to
   vent dependent. Will likely improve with volume removal
   3.       Altered MS - obtunded today but yesterday was  significantly
   more alert yesterday
   -          continue to hold sedation, minimal effective morphine dose

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent a preparation for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). She has been experiencing persistent neutropenia for six weeks and has developed several complications including Clostridium difficile colitis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently intubated and on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) with fluid removal.

The patient has a history of recurrent VRE bacteremia, and the most recent positive blood culture was on August 27th. She has also been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has received broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient is still neutropenic, and her mental status is altered.

The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is likely related to volume overload. She is currently on a ventilator and receiving supplemental oxygen. Her renal function is impaired, and she is tolerating ultrafiltration by hemodialysis (HD). Her liver function tests are abnormal but improving, and she has no evidence of biliary obstruction.

The patient's hematocrit (HCT) and platelet levels are low, and she requires transfusion goals per oncology. She experienced vaginal bleeding but has improved since platelets were transfused on September 3rd.

   Intubated. CVVH started [**8-31**] with fluid removal - 6L/24 hrs, now on HD
   38F with ALL and multiple acute issues including ARF now on HD,
   continued VRE bacteremia, neutropenia, and altered MS.
   1.        ID:  recurrent VRE bacteremia, most recent positive blood
   culture on [**8-27**].  History of cdiff on flagyl.
   -          Covered broadly for possible VAP for several days as well as
   for ongoing neutropenia.
   -          Continue linezolid for VRE x 2 weeks from last negative
   culture, will ask ID about restarting Daptomycin
   -          Received 8 days of Meropenem for VAP
 can discuss with ID
   changing or disontinuing GN coverage
   -          PO flagyl for cdiff colitis
 continue while neutropenic and
   on other antibiotics
   -          Caspofungin empirically for neutropenic fever
   -          Acyclovir prophylaxis
   2.        Acute respiratory Failure:
   -          at least in part related to 25+ liter volume overload for
   LOS.  She was treated for VAP.
   -          on FiO2 0.5/PEEP 8/PS 14 currently, tolerating. Continues to
   vent dependent. Will likely improve with volume removal
   3.       Altered MS - obtunded today but yesterday was  significantly
   more alert yesterday
   -          continue to hold sedation, minimal effective morphine dose
   for comfort
   -          monitor neuro status closely
   4.       Renal:  ARF multifactorial.
   -         Tolerating ultrafiltration by HD, continue aggressive volume
   removal
   5.        GI:  LFTs continue to be abnormal but improving, no evidence
   of biliary obstruction.
   -          On low lipid TPN, follow amylase/lipase, TG
   6.        Neutropenia
 improving
   7.        Heme:  HCT< 21 and Platelets < 10 as transfusion goals per

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical history and current condition suggest several potential medical complications:

1. VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) sepsis: The patient has a confirmed infection with VRE, which is a type of bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics. This could lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has low levels of all three blood cell types - red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This condition, known as pancytopenia, can lead to anemia, increased risk of infection, and bleeding problems.

3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support in the ICU due to respiratory failure. This means that their lungs are not able to adequately exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, resulting in low levels of oxygen in the blood.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). This could be due to factors such as sepsis, nephrotoxic medications, or previous episodes of hypotension.

5. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, which is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It can lead to severe colitis and may require"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently admitted to the ICU. She has multiple medical complications including sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, C. difficile infection, altered mental status, pancytopenia, and hyperbilirubinemia. She is on mechanical ventilation and has a central venous catheter and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is neutropenic with VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) sepsis. She has persistent bacteremia despite treatment, and there is a concern for endocarditis. She will undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out endocarditis, and if positive, gentamicin will be added to her antibiotic regimen.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to volume overload. She has been weaned off sedation, and her mental status has improved. Her respiratory status is stable, but she requires further optimization of PEEP settings.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure with an increased creatinine level of 4.2. She is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and will continue with intermittent hemodialysis (HD) to manage her fluid overload and electrolyte"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently experiencing multiple medical problems. These include sepsis, febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, pancreatitis, possible cardiac tamponade, peripheral edema, pancytopenia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure (acute kidney injury), bacteremia, and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Sepsis: The patient remains neutropenic with positive blood cultures growing yeast from the PICC line. She has been switched to daptomycin from linezolid.
- Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has been tolerating it well. Her creatinine level has increased to 4.2.
- Respiratory Failure: The patient has been extubated since August 29th and is currently on SIMV mode with increased PEEP to 10 and decreased FiO2 to 40%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.49.
- Hematuria: The patient has hematuria and clots with a residual volume of approximately 200-300cc. She will receive a transfusion of 2 units of platelets and then attempt to replace/flush the Foley catheter.
- Vaginal bleeding: The patient has a history of vaginal bleeding and is on estraderm. She has been transfused with platelets and will be monitored.
- Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis has resolved after dialysis.
- Papular rash: The patient has a papular rash on her forehead, likely due to contact dermatitis. She will continue to be monitored, and acyclovir prophylaxis will be continued.
- Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's total bilirubin remains at 2.7. CT abdomen/pelvis and RUQ ultrasound did not show any signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing the elevated bilirubin. The etiology is still uncertain.
- Elevated amylase: The patient has a history of pancreatitis this admission, which has since resolved. Her lipase levels are trending downward.
- Neutropenic fever: The patient continues to be afebrile overnight with multiple known sources of infection.
- Pancytopenia: The patient is likely experiencing pancytopenia due to recent reinduction chemotherapy.
- Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR but is not on anticoagulation. This is likely secondary to nutritional deficiency.
- C. Diff: The patient's last positive C. diff toxin was on July 18th.
- ALL: The patient has recently undergone chemotherapy and is at count nadirs. The plan is to ultimately perform a bone marrow transplant if the patient is medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU, and has functional status.
- FEN: The patient's total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was discontinued as the PICC line was removed. She will continue with tube feeding and other medications.
- PPX: The patient's prophylactic measures include pneumoboots, bowel regimen, and mouth care.
- LINES: The patient's lines include a dialysis catheter and a midline.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is still neutropenic with positive blood cultures, indicating a high risk for ongoing infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired renal function.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing need for mechanical ventilation indicates a risk for continued respiratory failure.
4. Hematuria: The presence of hematuria and clots may indicate bleeding in the urinary tract.
5. Vaginal bleeding: The patient's history of vaginal bleeding and use of estraderm suggest a risk for further bleeding.
6. Anion gap acidosis: Although resolved, there is a risk for recurrence.
7. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels may indicate liver dysfunction or other causes.
8. Elevated amylase: The patient's history"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), presenting with respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient has been unresponsive for over 48 hours, although brainstem reflexes are intact. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has persistent pancytopenia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, indicating possible infection or leukemia. Renal function tests reveal acute renal failure. Liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient has a history of malignancy, prolonged pancytopenia, and respiratory failure. She also has severe anasarca and has failed diuresis. There is evidence of C. difficile infection and bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). 

The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, multi-organ failure, and further progression of the underlying leukemia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), prolonged pancytopenia, and progressive decline in respiratory function. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. 

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The respiratory failure is multifactorial and easily manageable on the ventilator.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient has persistent pancytopenia, which refers to a reduction in all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). This condition requires careful monitoring and management.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient continues to experience acute renal failure, for which hemodialysis (HD) has been initiated. The patient's daily fluid balance needs to be carefully monitored.
4. Anasarca: The patient presents with anasarca, a condition characterized by generalized edema. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters per day.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which has improved today. The cause of the altered mental status is not delirium.
6. Leukemia: The patient has relapsed ALL, and her prolonged pancytopenia and progressive"

   38 yo female with relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with multiple medical
   problems, including [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, febrile neutropenia, respiratory
   distress, anion-gap acidosis,  and pancreatitis and possible tamponade
   physiology intubated s/p PEA arrest.
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis.  Pt with WBC
   remains at 0.1 today. Postive blood cx from [**9-1**] growing yeast from
   PICC line.  Pt was on caspofungin, which was discontinued and started
   on ambisome on [**9-4**]. Last positve [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] blood cultures one set from
   [**8-27**] midline (midline was removed).  Pt likely has persisent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**]
   bacteremia, switched to daptomycin ([**9-4**]) from linezolid. Dialysis and
   PICC line were placed [**8-31**]. PICC removed yesterday with tip sent for
   cultures.
   - continue daptomycin Q48hrs after HD
 ID recommends TEE and would add
   gent if positive.  TTE yesterday was negative for vegetations. Will get
   TEE for better assessment of valves.
   - Cont ambisome for yeast
 monitor K and Mg closely
 replete as
   needed.
   - PICC removed
 follow up cultures.
   - HD cath, will attempt to treat through infection
   - Optho consult for eye exam - showed diffuse hemorrhage likely due to
   leukemia or spesis, unlikely fungal.  Start artificial tears and
   erythro ointment.
   - Continue to monitor surveillance cultures
   - Continue empiric meropenem and c. diff flagyl and po vanc
   - f/u with ID recs if any
   # Acute Renal Failure: Pt started on CVVH ([**9-1**]) and switched to HD on
   [**9-2**]; tolerating well.  Pt had ~5L removed yesterday on HD. Pt
   continues to be oliguric.  Cr decreased to 3.2, though this value is
   not helpful as she is currently undergoing HD. ARF likely
   multifactorial ATN given PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and
   contrast exposure. Renal U/S no hydro.
   - Will cont HD despite positve blood cultures.  Will attempt to treat
   through infection
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. Pt able to shake head since [**9-2**], though
   not squeezing hands or moving toes this morning.  Volume status
   contributing to continued vent depedence.  Pt on HD with significant
   fluid removal daily.  Pt respiratory status stable, but some agitation
   with no sedation.
   - Currently on SIMV and tolerating well with increase in PEEP to 10,
   decrease in FiO2 to 40% yesterday. AM ABG = 7.49/32/100
   - HD to address volume overload
   - Fentanyl prn
   - Cont to monitor resp status
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria x1wk and clots.  Residual ~200-300cc.
   Patient transfused 2U of plts. Foley has been replaced.
    .
   #Vaginal bleeding: pt with h/o vaginal bleeding.  Pt is on estraderm
   and transfused plts.  Will monitor.
   - Appreciate Gyn input
   - Discontinue estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   .
   # Acid-Base: pH=7.49. PCO2=32, HCO3=21, AG=18. Despite an elevated
   anion gap, this patient is currently in respiratory alkalosis. This
   appears to be a combination of respiratory alkalosis and metabolic
   acidosis.
   - Will monitor chem-7
   - Cont dialysis
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Does not appear to be zoster and is stable.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: TBili remains at 2.7 today.  CT abdomen/pelvis
   and RUQ U/S did not show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing
   elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination
   of cholestasis, sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Transaminitis nearly resolved
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   .
   # Elevated amylase: Pt with h/o pancreatitis this admission that had
   since resolved. Lipase trending downwards. Currently on TPN and TF.
   Amylase within normal limits today.
   - Monitor pancreatic enzymes
   - TF restarted, trophic feeds
   .
   # Neutropenia: Patient continues to be afebrile overnight with multiple
   known sources of infection, including [**Year (2 digits) 1542**], C. diff, and now yeast.
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue dapto, meropenem, flagyl IV, vancomycin PO, acyclovir, and
   ambisome
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Likely in setting of recent reinduction.
   - Transfuse for hct<21 or plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   - Will give vitamin K
   .
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinue flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has multiple medical problems including sepsis, febrile neutropenia, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, and pancreatitis. She is currently intubated and in the ICU due to PEA arrest. The patient has positive blood cultures growing yeast from both the PICC line and dialysis catheter. She has been on various antibiotics, including caspofungin, linezolid, acyclovir, meropenem, and ambisome. The patient also has acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hematuria, vaginal bleeding, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated amylase, neutropenia, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, C. difficile infection, and ALL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing neutropenia with positive blood cultures growing yeast, indicating persistent bacteremia. There is a risk of continued sepsis despite antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is still dependent on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off sedation and extubation may be challenging due to volume overload.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has oliguric renal failure and requires ongoing hemodialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Hematuria: The patient has persistent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), currently undergoing chemotherapy. She is admitted to the ICU for multiple medical problems, including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is critical, with ongoing infections, including C. difficile and yeast, as well as ongoing fluid overload requiring hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic with ongoing sepsis and fungemia. She has multiple known sources of infection, including C. difficile and yeast. There is a concern for persistent bacteremia, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely multifactorial in origin. She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and tolerating it well. The plan for HD/ultrafiltration should be discussed with the renal team.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been off sedation since August 29th, with improvement in mental status. However, she remains minimally responsive and continues to depend on SIMV ventilation. Her respiratory status should be closely monitored, and fluid removal during HD should be optimized.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is related to chemotherapy prior to transfer to the ICU. She should continue to receive Neupogen and be"

   with WBC remains at 0.1 today. Postive blood cx from [**9-1**] growing
   yeast from PICC line.  Patient on ambisome since [**9-4**] for yeast
   coverage. Last positive [**Year (2 digits) 1542**] blood cultures are from [**8-27**]. Patient
   likely has persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia, on daptomycin since [**9-4**].
   Dialysis line removed yesterday. Ophtho consult for eye exam - showed
   diffuse hemorrhage likely due to leukemia or spesis, unlikely fungal.
   - Continue daptomycin Q48hrs after HD
 ID recommends TEE and would add
   gent if positive.  TTE was negative for vegetations. Will get TEE for
   better assessment of valves.

   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient started on CVVH on [**9-1**] and switched to
   HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well.  Pt had ~5L removed yesterday on HD. Pt
   continues to be oliguric.  Cr decreased to 2.8, though this value is
   not helpful as she is currently undergoing HD. ARF likely
   multifactorial ATN given PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and
   contrast exposure. Renal U/S no hydro.
   - Will discuss with renal the plan for HD/ultrafiltration.
   - Ask IR to place necessary lines
   .
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient restarted on
   lopressor 25mg PO BID.  Also has received labetalol gtt. Patient
   tachycardic as well, denying pain.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. Patient minimally responsive this
   morning. Her mental status seems to wax and wane throughout the day.
   Volume status contributing to continued vent dependence.  Patient on HD
   with significant fluid removal daily.  Pt respiratory status stable,
   but some agitation with no sedation.
   - Currently on SIMV and tolerating well.  Will work towards extubation
   by adjusting PEEP and/or FiO2. Will decrease PEEP today to 8 and
   monitor oxygen saturation.
   - HD to address volume overload
   - Fentanyl prn
   - Cont to monitor resp status
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Patient continues to be afebrile overnight with
   multiple known sources of infection, including [**Year (2 digits) 1542**], C. diff, and now
   yeast. Patient
s temperature trended upwards and she received Tylenol
   yesterday. Pancytopenia related to chemotherapy prior to transfer to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue dapto, meropenem, vancomycin PO, acyclovir, and ambisome
   - transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria x1wk and clots. Patient transfused 2U of
   plts yesterday. Currently on CBI to prevent clotting. Will remove CBI,
   use large foley.
    .
   #Vaginal bleeding: pt with h/o vaginal bleeding.  Pt is on estraderm
   and transfused plts.  Will monitor.
   - Appreciate Gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   .
   # Acid-Base: There appears to be a combination of respiratory alkalosis
   and metabolic acidosis based on yesterday
s values, HCO3=26 today.
   - Will monitor chem-7
   - Cont dialysis
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Stable.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Resolving. CT abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not
   show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.
   Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination of cholestasis,
   sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Transaminitis nearly resolved
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   - Will give vitamin K
   .
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   .
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.
   - f/u onc recs
   - Discuss with Onc, after TEE results,  the possibility of bone marrow
   biopsy to assess for presence of leukemia as this may affect
   management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and multiple medical problems, including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and required mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent bacteremia despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. She also has a yeast infection from the PICC line.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. She is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is on lopressor and labetalol for blood pressure control.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to her altered mental status and volume overload. Efforts are being made to wean her off sedation and extubate her.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is related to chemotherapy. She is receiving filgrastim (Neuopogen) to stimulate white blood cell production and transfusions for hematocrit <21% and platelet count <10,000/mm3.
6. Hematuria: The patient has been experiencing hematuria and clotting"

   continues to be oliguric.  Cr decreased to 2.6, though this value is
   not helpful as she is currently undergoing HD. ARF likely
   multifactorial ATN given PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and
   contrast exposure. Renal U/S did not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Plan to continue daily HD or ultrafiltration
   - Appreciate Renal input
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. Patient minimally responsive this
   morning. Her mental status seems to wax and wane throughout the day.

   with significant fluid removal daily.  Pt respiratory status stable,
   but some agitation with no sedation. Decreased PEEP to 8 yesterday with
   continued oxygen saturation in the high 90s.
   - Currently on SIMV and tolerating well.  Will work towards extubation
   by adjusting PEEP and/or FiO2. Will decrease FiO2 to 30% and continue
   to monitor saturation
   - HD to address volume overload
   - Fentanyl prn
   - Cont to monitor resp status
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Patient continues to be afebrile overnight with
   multiple known sources of infection, including [**Year (2 digits) 1542**], C. diff, and now
   yeast, though temperature trended upwards this morning to 100.1.
   Pancytopenia related to chemotherapy prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].
   - Tylenol this morning for low grade temperature
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue dapto, meropenem, vancomycin PO, acyclovir, and ambisome
   - transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
 will
   2 units transuse this morning
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria x1wk and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting. Will remove CBI, use large foley.
    .
   #Vaginal bleeding: pt with h/o vaginal bleeding.  Pt is on estraderm
   and transfused plts.  Will monitor.
   - Appreciate Gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   .
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient restarted on
   lopressor 25mg PO BID. Overnight, SBP was usually in 130s. Will
   continue current regimen.
   .
   # Acid-Base: There appears to be a combination of respiratory alkalosis
   and metabolic acidosis based on yesterday
s values, HCO3=26 today.
   - Will monitor chem-7
   - Cont dialysis
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Stable.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Resolving. CT abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not
   show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.
   Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination of cholestasis,
   sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Transaminitis nearly resolved
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   .
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with multiple medical problems, including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis since then.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malnutrition: The patient has been receiving tube feeds, but they were held after midnight for a procedure. Malnutrition can lead to delayed wound healing, increased infection risk, and impaired immune function.

2. Edema, Peripheral: The patient has anasarca, which indicates generalized edema. Peripheral edema can be a sign of fluid overload, heart failure, or kidney dysfunction.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has low counts of all blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets), which increases the risk of infections, bleeding, and anemia.

4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient is still on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and volume overload.

5. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to oliguria (low urine output) and elevated creatinine levels"

   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient started on CVVH on [**9-1**] and switched to
   HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well.  Pt had ~6L removed yesterday on HD. Pt
   continues to be oliguric.  Cr decreased to 2.6, though this value is
   not helpful as she is currently undergoing HD. ARF likely
   multifactorial ATN given PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and
   contrast exposure. Renal U/S did not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Plan to continue daily HD or ultrafiltration
   - Appreciate Renal input
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. Patient minimally responsive this
   morning. Her mental status seems to wax and wane throughout the day.
   Volume status contributing to continued vent dependence.  Patient on HD
   with significant fluid removal daily.  Pt respiratory status stable,
   but some agitation with no sedation. Decreased PEEP to 8 yesterday with
   continued oxygen saturation in the high 90s.
   - Currently on SIMV and tolerating well.  Will work towards extubation
   by adjusting PEEP and/or FiO2. Will decrease PEEP to 5 continuing to
   reassess saturation. If doing well, will attempt SBT later today.
   - HD to address volume overload
   - Fentanyl prn
   - Cont to monitor resp status
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Patient continues to be afebrile overnight with
   multiple known sources of infection, including [**Year (2 digits) 1542**], C. diff, and now
   yeast, though temperature trended upward this morning to 100.1.
   Pancytopenia related to chemotherapy prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].
   - Tylenol this morning for low grade temperature
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue dapto, meropenem, vancomycin PO, acyclovir, and ambisome
   - transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
 will
   2 units transuse this morning
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria x1wk and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting. Will remove CBI, use large foley.
    .
   #Vaginal bleeding: pt with h/o vaginal bleeding.  Pt is on estraderm
   and transfused plts.  Will monitor.
   - Appreciate Gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   .
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient restarted on
   lopressor 25mg PO BID. Overnight, SBP was usually in 130s. Will
   continue current regimen.
   .
   # Acid-Base: There appears to be a combination of respiratory alkalosis
   and metabolic acidosis based on yesterday
s values, HCO3=26 today.
   - Will monitor chem-7
   - Cont dialysis
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Stable.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Resolving. CT abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not
   show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.
   Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination of cholestasis,
   sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Transaminitis nearly resolved
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   .
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   .
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.
   - f/u onc recs
   - Discuss with Onc, after TEE results,  the possibility of bone marrow
   biopsy to assess for presence of leukemia as this may affect
   management.

","The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented with multiple medical problems including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She required mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Sepsis: The patient is neutropenic with ongoing infections, including bacteremia and fungemia. She is being treated with daptomycin, meropenem, vancomycin, and ambisome.
2. Pancytopenia: This is related to chemotherapy prior to transfer to the ICU. The patient is receiving Neupogen and transfusions for low hematocrit and platelet count.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has been on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and then switched to intermittent hemodialysis (HD). Her creatinine level has decreased to 2.6.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is minimally responsive and has been weaned off sedation. She is on SIMV mode with PEEP set at 8 and FiO2 at 40%. The plan is to attempt spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) later today.
5. Malnutrition: The patient has been fasting for tube feeds due to TEE procedure.
6. Edema: The patient has peripheral edema, which is likely due to volume overload.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a sedated male with multiple medical complications. The patient has a fever of 103.1°F, ongoing vaginal and urinary bleeding, and is on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and an increased respiratory rate. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury, pancytopenia (low white blood cells, low platelets, and low red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and altered mental status. The patient also has a history of anemia, hypertension, and liver function abnormalities.

The patient's imaging and microbiology results are not provided in the given information.

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure.
2. Renal failure: The elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury.
3. Sepsis: The fever, pancytopenia, and altered mental status could be signs of a severe infection leading to sepsis.
4. C. difficile infection: The presence of leukocytosis and diarrhea raises suspicion for Clostridium difficile infection.
5. Leukemia: The pancytopenia could also be indicative of an underlying hematological malignancy such as leukemia.
6. Liver function abnormalities: The elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction."

 will
   receive 2 units today of both platelets and PRBCs
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria x1wk and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting. Will remove CBI, use large foley.
    .
   #Vaginal bleeding: pt with h/o vaginal bleeding.  Pt is on estraderm
   and transfused plts.  Will monitor.
   - Appreciate Gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   .
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient restarted on
   lopressor 25mg PO BID. Overnight, SBP was usually in 130s. Will
   continue current regimen.
   .
   # Acid-Base: There appears to be a combination of respiratory alkalosis
   and metabolic acidosis based on yesterday
s values, HCO3=26 today.
   - Will monitor chem-7
   - Cont dialysis
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Stable.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Resolving. CT abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not
   show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.
   Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination of cholestasis,
   sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Transaminitis nearly resolved
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   .
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   .
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.
   - f/u onc recs
   - Discuss with Onc, after TEE results,  the possibility of bone marrow
   biopsy to assess for presence of leukemia as this may affect
   management.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been admitted to the ICU due to multiple medical problems. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was intubated.

The patient's recent lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 30, and anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL. The blood culture from the line PICC showed Parapneumonic effusion. Imaging tests, including TEE, did not reveal any valvular abnormalities or vegetations.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. She has been on hemodialysis and has had significant fluid removal daily. Her respiratory status is stable, but she is still dependent on mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue daily hemodialysis or ultrafiltration and work towards extubation by adjusting PEEP and/or FiO2.

The patient also has vaginal bleeding, which is being monitored, and hypertension, for which she is on lopressor. Her mental status has been fluctuating, and she is minimally responsive. There are ongoing concerns about her acid-base balance, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, and C. difficile infection.

Overall, the patient presents with a complex medical history and multiple organ dysfunctions requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include septic shock, multi-organ failure, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and further deterioration in respiratory status."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). She is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including prolonged pancytopenia (low blood cell counts), respiratory failure, VRE bacteremia (infection caused by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), and acute renal failure.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for critical care management. She requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, and her oxygenation has improved with lower levels of PEEP and FiO2. However, she still faces several barriers to extubation, including secretions, altered mental status, and profound weakness.

Pancytopenia persists despite ongoing treatments. Acute renal failure continues, and the patient is on hemodialysis. Anasarca, a condition characterized by generalized edema, is also present.

Other active issues include altered mental status, electrolyte imbalances while on ambisome (an antifungal medication), and close monitoring of glycemic control.

The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition support through enteral feeding, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Her code status remains as full code, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken in case of cardiac arrest. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU, and she requires close monitoring and intensive care management."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Fever: The patient has had a high fever of 103.1°F in the past 24 hours, indicating an ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure. There are multiple barriers to extubation, including secretions, altered mental status, and profound weakness.
3. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, which is a serious infection caused by bacteria that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
4. Fungemia: The patient also has fungemia, specifically caused by Candida torulosis. This requires double coverage for fungal infections.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has persistent pancytopenia, which means low levels of all types of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). She requires blood and platelet transfusions.
6. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to acute renal failure. She is on hemodialysis (HD) to support kidney function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
- She has prolonged pancytopenia and is experiencing a progressive decline in respiratory function.
- The patient also has Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia.
- Active issues include persistent multifactorial respiratory failure, ongoing pancytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), anasarca, and altered mental status.
- The patient is critically ill and currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is likely due to her underlying leukemia and prolonged pancytopenia. There may be multiple barriers to extubation, including secretions, mental status, and profound weakness.
2. Fungemia: The patient has a C. difficile infection, which can lead to complications such as sepsis, antibiotic-associated colitis, and transmission of the infection to others.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's prolonged pancytopenia puts her at risk for bleeding, infection, and other hematological abnormalities.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF requires ongoing hemodialysis (HD) to manage fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Anasarca: The patient's generalized edema (anasarca) needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been experiencing prolonged pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient has been in the ICU and has received various treatments including antibiotics, blood transfusions, and dialysis. Despite these interventions, the patient continues to struggle with multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is likely due to a combination of factors such as secretions, mental status, and profound weakness. There are multiple barriers to extubation, and the patient may require continued ventilatory support.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient has persistent pancytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This condition can lead to anemia, increased risk of infection, and bleeding tendencies.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and the need for dialysis. ARF can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
4. Anasarca: The patient has generalized edema known as anasarca. This condition can be associated with various underlying causes, including hypoalbuminemia, fluid overload,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is critically ill in the ICU. She has been experiencing prolonged pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated and on hemodialysis (HD) due to acute renal failure. She also has anasarca, which is being treated with negative fluid balance goals. Her mental status is fluctuating, and there are concerns about her readiness for extubation due to secretions, mental status, and profound weakness. Additionally, the patient has a fungemia caused by Candida species, persistent pancytopenia, and requires close electrolyte monitoring while on Ambisome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and has multiple barriers to extubation, including secretions, mental status, and profound weakness.
2. Fungemia: The patient has a confirmed fungemia caused by Candida species, which requires appropriate antifungal treatment.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has persistent pancytopenia, which can lead to an increased risk of infections, bleeding, and other complications.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure, indicating impaired kidney function and the need for ongoing renal support.
5. Anasarca: The"

   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient started on CVVH on [**9-1**] and switched to
   HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well.  Pt had 6.3L removed yesterday on HD. Pt
   continues to be oliguric.  Cr increased to 3.6, though this value is
   not helpful as she is currently undergoing HD. ARF likely
   multifactorial ATN given PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and
   contrast exposure. Renal U/S did not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Plan to continue daily HD or ultrafiltration
   - Appreciate Renal input
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. Patient minimally responsive this
   morning. Her mental status seems to wax and wane throughout the day.
   Volume status contributing to continued vent dependence.  Patient on HD
   with significant fluid removal daily.  Pt respiratory status stable,
   but some agitation with no sedation. Patient has decent cough/gag with
   minimal ET secretions. Patient is currently febrile which is a
   contraindication to extubation. Patient continues to have poor mental
   status as well.
   - Currently on SIMV and tolerating well.  Will work towards extubation
   by adjusting PEEP and/or FiO2. PEEP at 5 while continuing to reassess
   saturation.
   - Will check for cuff leak and possible SBT today.
   - HD to address volume overload
   - Fentanyl prn
   - Cont to monitor resp status
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Patient continues to be afebrile overnight with
   multiple known sources of infection, including [**Year (2 digits) 1542**], C. diff, and now
   yeast, though temperature trended upward this morning to 100.1.
   Pancytopenia related to chemotherapy prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].
   - Tylenol this morning for fever prior to transfusions
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue dapto, meropenem, vancomycin PO, acyclovir, and ambisome
   - transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
 will
   receive 2 units today of both platelets and PRBCs
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria x1wk and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting. Will remove CBI, use large foley.
    .
   #Vaginal bleeding: pt with h/o vaginal bleeding.  Pt is on estraderm
   and transfused plts.  Will monitor.
   - Appreciate Gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   .
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient written for
   labetalol, though not requiring currently it. Stable.
   .
   # Acid-Base: There appears to be a combination of respiratory alkalosis
   and metabolic acidosis based on yesterday
s values, HCO3=26 today.
   - Will monitor chem-7
   - Cont dialysis
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Stable.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Resolving. CT abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not
   show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.
   Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination of cholestasis,
   sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Transaminitis nearly resolved
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   .
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently in the ICU for sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She had a previous cardiac arrest and required mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. The patient is still neutropenic with ongoing bacteremia and fungemia. She has multiple medical problems including malnutrition, peripheral edema, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be at risk for sepsis due to her neutropenia and ongoing bacteremia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation and is at risk for further respiratory failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be multifactorial including ATN due to PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. She is currently undergoing hemodialysis.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely related to chemotherapy prior to transfer to the ICU. She requires ongoing monitoring and management of her blood counts.
5. Hematuria: The patient has a history of hematuria and clots. She is currently on CBI to prevent clotting, and a large foley catheter has been placed.
6. Vaginal bleeding: The patient"

 CARDIAC ARREST
   38 yo female with relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with multiple medical
   problems, including [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory
   failure, and acute renal failure s/p PEA arrest requiring mechanical
   ventilation and hemodialysis.
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia. Pt
   with WBC remains at 0.1 today. Patient on ambisome since [**9-4**] for
   yeast coverage for positive blood culture on [**9-1**]. Last positive [**Month/Year (2) 1542**]
   blood cultures are from [**8-27**], although positive gram positive blood
   culture now from [**9-9**]. Patient likely has persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia,
   on daptomycin since [**9-4**] - on [**9-9**] started back on linezolid given
   resurrgeance of positive blood cultures. Also febrile and hypotensive
   over past 24 hours requiring fluid bolus. TEE without indication of
   endocarditis.
   - Linezolid restarted [**9-10**]; daptomycin d/c'ed
   - Cont ambisome for yeast (last positive culture [**9-2**], [**Female First Name (un) **]
   parapsilosis)
 monitor K and Mg with q12hr labs
   - HD cath removed [**9-7**]
 preliminary read shows no significant growth
   - Continue to monitor daily surveillance cultures
   - Continue meropenem, PO vanc
   - Given febrile with rigors yesterday, given 1 dose of tobramycin -
   given that we have positive blood culture from yesterday with gram
   positive bacteria, may d/c tobramycin
   - CMV viral load pending, Galactomannan
   # Acute renal failure: Patient started on CVVH on [**9-1**] and switched to
   HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well. Pt continues to be oliguric. Cr 2.9,
   though this value is not helpful as she is currently undergoing HD. ARF
   likely multifactorial ATN given PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications,
   and contrast exposure. Renal U/S did not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Plan to continue daily HD or ultrafiltration
   - Appreciate renal input
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to remove/replace HD line as patient is bacteremic once
   again
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. On [**9-9**] difficult to arouse in context
   of being febrile, hypotensive, and once again with positive blood
   cultures. Volume status contributing to continued vent dependence.
   Patient on HD with significant fluid removal daily. Respiratory status
   stable, but some agitation with no sedation. Patient has decent
   cough/gag with minimal ET secretions.
   - Currently on SIMV and tolerating well.  Will work towards extubation
   by adjusting PEEP and/or FiO2. PEEP at 5 while continuing to reassess
   saturation.
   - Will check for cuff leak and possible SBT today.
   - HD to address volume overload
   - Fentanyl prn
   - Cont to monitor resp status
   # Pancytopenia: Secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned
   BMT prior to ICU admission. Multiple known sources of infection,
   including [**Month/Year (2) 1542**], C. diff, and yeast.
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue meropenem, linezolid vancomycin PO, and ambisome
   - Per ID recs, may stop acyclovir as marrow suppresant and no active
   viral infection at this time
   - Transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria x1wk and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting.
   #Vaginal bleeding: pt with h/o vaginal bleeding.  Pt is on estraderm
   and transfused plts.  Will monitor.
   - Appreciate Gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient written for
   labetalol, though not requiring currently it. Stable.
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Stable.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Resolving. CT abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not
   show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.
   Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination of cholestasis,
   sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Transaminitis nearly resolved
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.
   - f/u onc recs
   - s/p bone marrow biopsy on [**9-9**]
   # FEN:
   - TPN discontinued as PICC was removed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been admitted to the ICU for multiple medical problems, including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and is currently on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. The patient remains neutropenic and has positive blood cultures for gram-positive bacteria, indicating persistent bacteremia. She is febrile and hypotensive, requiring fluid bolus and antibiotics. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is still dependent on SIMV mode of ventilation. Her renal function is compromised, and she is oliguric with elevated creatinine levels. She has a history of hypertension and is on lopressor. The patient also has a papular rash on her forehead, which is likely contact dermatitis. She has hyperbilirubinemia with resolving transaminitis and elevated INR, likely due to nutritional deficiency. She is at risk for bleeding due to pancytopenia and is on Neupogen to stimulate neutrophil production. The patient has a history of vaginal bleeding and is being monitored with gynecological input. Her condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ dysfunctions, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, sepsis, and C. difficile infection."

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and multiple medical problems. She is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis due to her condition. She has had multiple positive blood cultures, including gram-positive bacteria, yeast, and Clostridium difficile. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. She is febrile and hypotensive, requiring fluid resuscitation. The patient's respiratory status is stable on SIMV mode with minimal ET secretions. Her renal function is being managed with daily hemodialysis or ultrafiltration. Pancytopenia is secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The patient's hematuria and vaginal bleeding require further evaluation. Hypertension is stable, and a papular rash on her forehead is improving. Hyperbilirubinemia is resolving, and coagulopathy is likely due to nutritional deficiency. The patient has a history of ALL, C. difficile infection, and yeast infection. The plan is to perform a bone marrow transplant if the patient is medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU, and has functional status."

 FEVER - 103.8
F - [**2135-9-9**] 07:00 AM
   - Continues to be febrile
   - HD performed
   - Bone marrow biopsy performed - per onc fellow, bone marrow empty
   - Per ID fellow, started tobramycin for additional gram negative
   coverage x1.  Discussed with ID attending last night, will hold
   tobramycin as fevers and rigors likely due to GPC bacteremia. Will also
   discuss with Onc holding acyclovir for bone marrow suppression unless
   she develops mucositis, etc.
   - Blood cultures for [**9-12**] AM grew out GPC in pairs and chains (~12

   38 yo female with relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with multiple medical
   problems, including [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory
   failure, and acute renal failure s/p PEA arrest requiring mechanical
   ventilation and hemodialysis.
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia. Pt
   with WBC remains at 0.1 today. Patient on ambisome since [**9-4**] for
   yeast coverage for positive blood culture on [**9-1**]. Last positive [**Month/Year (2) 1542**]
   blood cultures are from [**8-27**], although positive gram positive blood
   culture now from [**9-9**]. Patient likely has persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia,
   on daptomycin since [**9-4**] - on [**9-9**] started back on linezolid given
   resurrgeance of positive blood cultures. Also febrile and hypotensive
   over past 24 hours requiring fluid bolus. TEE without indication of
   endocarditis.
   - Linezolid restarted [**9-10**]; daptomycin d/c'ed
   - Cont ambisome for yeast (last positive culture [**9-2**], [**Female First Name (un) **]
   parapsilosis)
 monitor K and Mg with q12hr labs
   - HD cath removed [**9-7**]
 preliminary read shows no significant growth
   - Continue to monitor daily surveillance cultures
   - Continue meropenem, PO vanc
   - Given febrile with rigors yesterday, given 1 dose of tobramycin -
   given that we have positive blood culture from yesterday with gram
   positive bacteria, may d/c tobramycin
   - CMV viral load pending, Galactomannan
   # Acute renal failure: Patient started on CVVH on [**9-1**] and switched to
   HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well. Pt continues to be oliguric. Cr 2.9,
   though this value is not helpful as she is currently undergoing HD. ARF
   likely multifactorial ATN given PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications,
   and contrast exposure. Renal U/S did not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Plan to continue daily HD or ultrafiltration
   - Appreciate renal input
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to remove/replace HD line as patient is bacteremic once
   again
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. On [**9-9**] difficult to arouse in context
   of being febrile, hypotensive, and once again with positive blood
   cultures. Volume status contributing to continued vent dependence.
   Patient on HD with significant fluid removal daily. Respiratory status
   stable, but some agitation with no sedation. Patient has decent
   cough/gag with minimal ET secretions.
   - Currently on SIMV and tolerating well.  Will work towards extubation
   by adjusting PEEP and/or FiO2. PEEP at 5 while continuing to reassess
   saturation.
   - Will check for cuff leak and possible SBT today.
   - HD to address volume overload
   - Fentanyl prn
   - Cont to monitor resp status
   # Pancytopenia: Secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned
   BMT prior to ICU admission. Multiple known sources of infection,
   including [**Month/Year (2) 1542**], C. diff, and yeast.
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue meropenem, linezolid vancomycin PO, and ambisome
   - Per ID recs, may stop acyclovir as marrow suppresant and no active
   viral infection at this time
   - Transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria x1wk and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting.
   #Vaginal bleeding: pt with h/o vaginal bleeding.  Pt is on estraderm
   and transfused plts.  Will monitor.
   - Appreciate Gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient written for
   labetalol, though not requiring currently it. Stable.
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Stable.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: Resolving. CT abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not
   show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated Tbili.
   Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination of cholestasis,
   sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Transaminitis nearly resolved
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.
   - f/u onc recs
   - s/p bone marrow biopsy on [**9-9**]
   # FEN:
   - TPN discontinued as PICC was removed.
   - Continue TF
   - Cont reglan, lactulose, senokot, colace
   - Follow blood sugars and on ISS
   # PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, mouthcare
   # LINES: Dialysis cath and PICC
   - Recent placement of midline - positive blood culture on [**9-10**] drawn
   from this line
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to replace PICC and dialysis catheter given that patient is
   once again bacteremic

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been neutropenic with ongoing sepsis and fungemia despite multiple antibiotic regimens. She has positive blood cultures for Gram-positive bacteria, and her condition has not improved despite receiving daptomycin and linezolid. The patient is febrile, hypotensive, and has a positive blood culture, indicating persistent bacteremia. She is on hemodialysis and has been oliguric since admission. Her respiratory status is stable, but she is still dependent on mechanical ventilation. Pancytopenia is secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned bone marrow transplant. The patient also has a history of hypertension, vaginal bleeding, hematuria, and a papular rash on her forehead.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent bacteremia despite receiving multiple antibiotics, indicating a high risk for sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has oliguric status and requires hemodialysis, indicating a risk for worsening renal function.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
    Newly febrile and recent hypotension after daptomycin stopped. Recent
   BdCultures suggest VRE bacteremia. Back on linezolid, also on
   merepenem, ambisone, acylcovir, po vanco (Cdiff + in [**7-25**])
   Lines are a concerning source but vascular access has been an ongoing
   problem. [**Name (NI) **] pull out vascular cath after HD today. In past has
   required IR guidance for CVL's, but may be able to place now with
   decreased edema-- will review
   fluid resuscitate as needed
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   Continues to require ventilatory support. Current
   oxygenation/ventilation on vent settings adequate- continue. Not a
   candidate for weaning due to mental status
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Received HD today
   Tachycardia: Has been in and out of [**Last Name (un) 1642**], though brief run to 150's
   during HD today though spontaneously resolved
   Multiple contributing factors, includng sepsis, recent removal of
   fluids through HD
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], off sedatives for the past 7 days
   Would ultimately benefit from repeat head CT but hemodynamics more
   recently tenuous and need to be stabilized first.
 PANCYTOPENIA
   Still without BM recovery after chemo
   BMBx yesterday; await results
   On neupogen
   Will discuss with ID and Onc- question whether persistent pancytopenia
   could represent drug effect
   Supportive care/transfusion of plts, blood as needed
   Vaginal bleeding/acute blood loss anemia - on estraderm, requires blood

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been in the ICU for 23 days. They have been experiencing respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. The patient's mental status is altered, and they are unable to provide a medical history due to sedation and encephalopathy. The patient has pancytopenia, which is still unresolved after chemotherapy. They have also had a cardiac arrest and require ongoing supportive care, including blood transfusions and platelet transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support, and weaning is not currently possible due to their altered mental status. The risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a concern.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile and hypotensive after stopping daptomycin, suggesting a possible central line infection. There is also evidence of VRE bacteremia. The patient is now on linezolid, meropenem, and ambisone to treat the infection.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. They have received hemodialysis (HD) today and may require further renal support.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and they are currently unresponsive. A repeat head CT would be beneficial to assess for"

   38 yo female with relapsed ALL s/p chemotherapy with multiple medical
   problems, including [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory
   failure, and acute renal failure s/p PEA arrest requiring mechanical
   ventilation and hemodialysis.
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia.
   Patient on ambisome since [**9-4**] for yeast coverage for positive blood
   culture on [**9-1**] ([**Female First Name (un) **] PARAPSILOSIS) most recent [**9-6**] growing
   yeast. Patient has persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia most recent positive
   culture from [**9-9**], on daptomycin since [**9-4**] - on [**9-9**] started back
   on linezolid given resurrgeance of positive blood cultures.  HD line
   was removed [**9-10**]. TEE without indication of endocarditis.
   - cont Linezolid restarted; daptomycin d/c'ed [**9-10**]
   - Cont ambisome for yeast (last positive culture [**9-2**], [**Female First Name (un) **]
   parapsilosis)
   - Continue meropenem for broad gram negative coverage
   - Continue vancomycin PO for C diff (last positive C diff toxin [**7-18**])
   - will need to place new midline and remove midline. HD cath removed
   [**9-7**]
 preliminary read shows no significant growth
   - Continue to monitor daily surveillance cultures
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - Appreciated ID recs
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. On [**9-10**]  pt responds minimally to simple
   commands. Volume status contributing to continued vent dependence.
   Patient on HD with significant fluid removal daily. Respiratory status
   stable, but some agitation with no sedation. Patient has decent
   cough/gag with minimal ET secretions.
   - Currently on SIMV and tolerating well.  Will work towards extubation
   by adjusting PEEP and/or FiO2. PEEP at 5, FiO2 40% and satting well; if
   hemodynamically stable will try to wean today.
   - HD to address volume overload
   - Fentanyl prn
   # Acute renal failure: Patient started on CVVH on [**9-1**] and switched to
   HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well. Pt had HD line pulled yeaterday. Urine
   output difficult to assess given CBI. ARF likely multifactorial ATN
   given PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. Renal
   U/S did not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Plan to place new line on Monday
   - Plan for HD on after new line placement
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Hyperglycemia: Pt with increase blood glucose into the 300's.  Pt is
   on 13 lantus.  Pt required additional 51U of SS yeasterday.
   - will give 10 NPH x1 tonight
   - will increase lantus dose to 25U and inrease SS
   - monitor FS and cover with SS
   .
   #Shaking: Pt with intermittent shaking/twitching per nursing. Unlikely
   patient is in status given it waxes and wanes.  Possible shivers from
   her sepsis.  Will cont to monitor and if progresses t/c EEG or repeat
   imaging.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented to the ICU with sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She is currently neutropenic with ongoing [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia and yeast infection. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. She has a history of multiple medical problems, including C. difficile infection and altered mental status. The patient is expected to undergo a bone marrow transplant if she becomes medically stable and meets certain criteria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is ongoing, with positive blood cultures for [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] and yeast. She remains neutropenic, which increases her risk of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to volume overload and ongoing respiratory support requirements.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, resulting from factors such as PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. Continued hemodialysis is necessary, and the need for further renal support will depend on her urine output and renal function.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancyt"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is experiencing multiple medical problems. These include sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been through chemotherapy and has a history of multiple infections, including bacteremia and yeast infection. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
- Heart rate: 128 bpm
- Blood pressure: 143/97 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: <0.1 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 25.5%
- Platelet count: 78 K/uL
- Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
- Glucose: 353 mg/dL
- Sodium: 104 mEq/L
- Potassium: 3.6 mEq/L
- Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
- Phosphorus: 4.7 mg/dL
- Albumin: 2.6 g/dL

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and treatments, including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, C. difficile infection, yeast infection, and hyperglycemia. The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal medications, and adjusting insulin dosage to control blood glucose levels.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has low white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts, which increases the risk of infection, bleeding, and anemia.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can cause severe colitis and dehydration.
6. Yeast infection: The patient has a yeast infection, which can lead to systemic fungal infection.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood glucose levels, which can increase the risk of infection and delay wound healing.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and response to treatment. Prompt intervention and adjustment of treatment plans will be necessary to address any complications that may arise."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. These include respiratory failure, sepsis from VRE/fungemia, pancytopenia, renal failure, C. difficile infection, altered mental status, leukemia, liver function abnormalities, and hypertension.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications to treat the sepsis. Additionally, they are on ventilatory support due to acute respiratory failure. The pancytopenia is persistent and there is no evidence of bone marrow recovery, with supportive care ongoing. The patient also has acute renal failure and is receiving hemodialysis.

The patient's blood glucose levels remain high, and insulin therapy has been adjusted accordingly. Other plans and treatments are being managed by the ICU housestaff.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration in respiratory function, worsening of sepsis, progression of renal failure, development of additional infections, and complications related to the underlying leukemia. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment plans as necessary to address these potential complications."

   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. Pt currently not responding to command.
   Volume status improved with HD now -7L in LOS- but still could be
   contributing to continued vent dependence.  Patient last had HD [**9-10**]
   and currently on line holiday. SBT today going well. Pt w/ some
   agitation- getting PRN ativan. Patient has decent cough/gag with
   moderate ET secretions.
   - Currently on SBT and tolerating well so far.

   without any cells.
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue meropenem, linezolid, vancomycin PO, and ambisome
   - Per ID recs, stopped acyclovir [**9-11**] as marrow suppresant and no
   active viral infection at this
   - Transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding- pt got
   2 units PRBCs and plt today
   - f/u final BM biopsy results from [**9-9**]
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria 2wks and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting.
   -Will consult urology today
   #Vaginal bleeding: History of vaginal bleeding.
   - Appreciate gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient written for
   labetalol, though not requiring currently. Hypotensive this am. Midline
   was pulled, PIV
s placed and pt currently holding steady in 110s/50s
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Improving.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: T bili stable at 3.0 currently. CT abdomen/pelvis
   and RUQ U/S did not show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing
   elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination
   of cholestasis, sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - cont TF
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.

   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   resident and fellow for key portions of the services provided.  Patient
   continues to be critically ill, ventilated, sedated albeit opens eyes
   to touch.  Lungs with occasional rhonchi, no wheeze, abdomen distended,
   occ. BS, trace to 1+ edema. Continues neutropenic, repeat BM biopsy
   essentially empty. Have stopped acyclovir given possibility this is
   contributing to BM suppression. Repeat positive blood culture for
   enterococcus. Have taken midline out, two peripheral IVs placed.  Poor
   glucose control requiring the addition of an insulin drip likely
   secondary to persistent bacteremia.  Transfused ptls for plt count <
   5K. Else,  I agree with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s assessment and plan above.
   Prognosis poor.  Total time spend 50 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who presented with sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure following cardiopulmonary arrest. She has been mechanically ventilated and requires hemodialysis. The patient remains critically ill, with ongoing neutropenia and positive blood cultures for yeast and enterococcus. She also has a history of C. difficile infection and a papular rash on her forehead.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic and has persistent bacteremia, indicating a high risk for recurrent sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, requiring ongoing mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for prolonged ventilator dependence due to volume overload.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she requires hemodialysis. There is a possibility of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy. This puts her at risk for bleeding and infection.
5. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can recur and lead to severe colitis.
6. Yeast Infection: The patient has persistent yeast infection, and there is a risk of dissemination if not appropriately"

   # Acute renal failure: Patient started on CVVH on [**9-1**] and switched to
   HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well. Pt had HD line pulled [**9-10**]. Urine output
   difficult to assess given CBI. ARF likely multifactorial ATN given PEA
   arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. Renal U/S did
   not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Plan to place new line Tues or Wed
   - Plan for HD after new line placement
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Hyperglycemia: Pt with increase blood glucose into the 300-400
   necessitating pt on Insulin gtt yesterday
   -currently on 4 units /hr insulin gtt
   .
   #Shaking: Pt with intermittent shaking/twitching per nursing. Unlikely
   patient is in status given it waxes and wanes.  Possible shivers from
   her sepsis.  Will cont to monitor and if progresses t/c EEG or repeat
   imaging.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned
   BMT prior to ICU admission. Multiple known sources of infection,
   including [**Month/Year (2) 1542**], C. diff, and yeast. Bone marrow biopsy [**9-9**] by report
   without any cells.
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue meropenem, linezolid, vancomycin PO, and ambisome
   - Per ID recs, stopped acyclovir [**9-11**] as marrow suppresant and no
   active viral infection at this
   - Transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding- pt got
   2 units PRBCs and plt today
   - f/u final BM biopsy results from [**9-9**]
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria 2wks and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting.
   -Will consult urology today
   #Vaginal bleeding: History of vaginal bleeding.
   - Appreciate gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient written for
   labetalol, though not requiring currently. Hypotensive this am. Midline
   was pulled, PIV
s placed and pt currently holding steady in 110s/50s
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Improving.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: T bili stable at 3.0 currently. CT abdomen/pelvis
   and RUQ U/S did not show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing
   elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination
   of cholestasis, sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - cont TF
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis with respiratory failure. She has multiple medical problems including pancytopenia, acute renal failure, bacteremia, C. difficile infection, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, and hypertension. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, and acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She is neutropenic with ongoing yeast and bacterial infections. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic with ongoing bacteremia and fungemia, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including the effects of sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and potential ARDS.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely multifactorial due to PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned bone marrow transplant (BMT).
5. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which increases the risk of recurrence and complications.
6. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, with an uncertain etiology."

   do at this time.
   - Transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding
   - f/u biopsy results
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria x1wk and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting.
   #Vaginal bleeding: History of vaginal bleeding.
   - Appreciate gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient written for
   labetalol, though not requiring currently. Stable.
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Improving.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   - Pt on acyclovir ppx (f/u ID)
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: slightly increased from yesterday. CT
   abdomen/pelvis and RUQ U/S did not show signs of hepatobiliary
   pathology causing elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at this point.
   Could be combination of cholestasis, sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - Feedings initiated as above
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.
   - f/u onc recs
   - s/p bone marrow biopsy on [**9-9**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed ALL, who is experiencing multiple medical problems including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and pancytopenia.
- She was admitted to the ICU after a PEA arrest and required mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis.
- The patient has ongoing neutropenia with [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis and fungemia.
- She has persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia and positive blood cultures.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, and she is off sedation. She is tolerating SIMV well and may be weaned off the ventilator soon.
- Acute renal failure is suspected to be multifactorial, possibly due to ATN, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and her insulin dosage needs adjustment.
- She exhibits intermittent shaking/twitching, which may be due to sepsis or shivers.
- Pancytopenia is secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned BMT.
- The patient has a history of vaginal bleeding and hematuria with clots.
- She has hypertension, but currently stable without requiring lopressor.
- A papular rash on her forehead is likely contact dermatitis.
- Hyperbilirubinemia is slightly increased, and the etiology is uncertain.
- Coagulopathy is likely secondary to nutritional deficiency.
- The patient has a history of C. diff infection, currently treated with PO vancomycin.
- She underwent a bone marrow biopsy that showed no evidence of leukemia.
- The plan is to perform a BM transplant if the patient becomes medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU, and has functional status.
- The patient's lines, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis are being managed appropriately.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing neutropenia with [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis and fungemia. She has persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia and positive blood cultures. The patient is at risk of further infections and sepsis complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator will be monitored closely to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely multifactorial in origin. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further renal deterioration.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy. This increases the risk of bleeding and infection.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating poor glycemic control. Insulin adjustment"

   problems, including [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory
   failure, and acute renal failure s/p PEA arrest requiring mechanical
   ventilation and hemodialysis.
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia.
   Patient on ambisome since [**9-4**] for yeast coverage for positive blood
   culture on [**9-1**] ([**Female First Name (un) **] PARAPSILOSIS) most recent [**9-6**] growing
   yeast. Patient has persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia most recent positive
   culture from [**9-9**], on daptomycin since [**9-4**] - on [**9-9**] started back
   on linezolid given resurrgeance of positive blood cultures.  HD line
   was removed [**9-10**]. TEE without indication of endocarditis [**9-8**].  Now
   growing GNR from blood cx [**9-11**] and [**9-12**] despite being on meropenem
   - cont Linezolid restarted; daptomycin d/c'ed [**9-10**]
   - Cont ambisome for yeast (last positive culture [**9-2**], [**Female First Name (un) **]
   parapsilosis)
   - Consider changing meropenem for  gram negative coverage as now has
   GNR bacteremia- will d/w ID
   - Continue vancomycin PO for C diff (last positive C diff toxin [**7-18**]),
   flagyl IV

s in place. HD cath removed [**9-7**]
   preliminary read shows no significant growth
   - Continue to monitor daily surveillance cultures
   - f/u CMV viral load
 pending from [**9-9**]
   - Appreciated ID recs
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   improvement in mental status. Pt currently responding to command.
   Volume status improved with HD now -6.3L in LOS- but still could be
   contributing to continued vent dependence.  Patient last had HD [**9-10**]
   and currently on line holiday. SBT yesterday went well for several hrs.
   Pt w/ some agitation- getting PRN ativan. Patient has decent cough/gag
   with moderate ET secretions.

   - HD on line holiday for now but will reconsider placing line tomorrow
   - Fentanyl prn
   # Acute renal failure: Patient started on CVVH on [**9-1**] and switched to
   HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well. Pt had HD line pulled [**9-10**]. Urine output
   difficult to assess given CBI. ARF likely multifactorial ATN given PEA
   arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. Renal U/S did
   not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Plan to place new line perhaps tomorrow
   - Plan for HD after new line placement
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Hyperglycemia: Pt with increase blood glucose into the 300-400
   necessitating pt to be put back on  Insulin gtt o/n
   -cont insulin gtt for now
   .
   #Shaking: Pt with intermittent shaking/twitching per nursing. Unlikely
   patient is in status given it waxes and wanes.  Possible shivers from
   her sepsis.  Will cont to monitor and if progresses t/c EEG or repeat
   imaging.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned
   BMT prior to ICU admission. Multiple known sources of infection,
   including new GNR bacteremia,  [**Month/Year (2) 1542**], C. diff, and yeast. Bone marrow
   biopsy [**9-9**] by report without any cells but still awaiting final
   results
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue meropenem, linezolid, vancomycin PO, and ambisome- talk to
   ID today about possibly adding better GNR coverage.
   - Per ID recs, stopped acyclovir [**9-11**] as marrow suppresant and no
   active viral infection at this
   - Transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding- pt to
   get 2 units plt today once she is no longer febrile
   - f/u final BM biopsy results from [**9-9**]
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria 2wks and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting. Urology consulted yesterday and recommended starting
   ditropan for bladder spasm and cont CBI.
   -Will cont CBI for [**Male First Name (un) **]
   #Vaginal bleeding: History of vaginal bleeding.
   - Appreciate gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   - Start Lupron at end of month
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient written for
   labetalol, though not requiring currently. BP now steady at 110-130's/
   40's-70's
   # Papular rash: Patient with papular rash on forehead since [**9-1**].
   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Improving.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: T bili stable at 3.0 currently. CT abdomen/pelvis
   and RUQ U/S did not show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing
   elevated Tbili.  Uncertain etiology at this point. Could be combination
   of cholestasis, sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   - cont TF
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.
   - f/u onc recs
   - s/p bone marrow biopsy on [**9-9**]- final results pending

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented to the ICU with sepsis, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She has been experiencing multiple medical problems, including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she continues to require mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing neutropenia with persistent bacteremia despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a need for continued antimicrobial therapy and consideration of changing the antibiotic regimen to cover gram-negative bacteria.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still requires mechanical ventilation. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) was attempted yesterday but was unsuccessful due to agitation. Another SBT is planned for today.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) since September 1st and switched to intermittent hemodialysis (HD) on September 2nd. Her urine output is difficult to assess due to continuous bladder irrigation (CBI). Renal ultrasound did not reveal any signs of hydronephrosis.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned bone"

   problems, including [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory
   failure, and acute renal failure s/p PEA arrest requiring mechanical
   ventilation and hemodialysis.
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia.
   Patient on ambisome since [**9-4**] for yeast coverage for positive blood
   culture on [**9-1**] ([**Female First Name (un) **] PARAPSILOSIS) most recent [**9-6**] growing
   yeast. Patient has persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia most recent positive
   culture from [**9-9**], on daptomycin since [**9-4**] - on [**9-9**] started back
   on linezolid given resurrgeance of positive blood cultures.  HD line
   was removed [**9-10**]. TEE without indication of endocarditis [**9-8**].  Now
   growing GNR from blood cx [**9-11**] and [**9-12**] despite being on meropenem
   - cont Linezolid restarted; daptomycin d/c'ed [**9-10**]
   - Cont ambisome for yeast (last positive culture [**9-2**], [**Female First Name (un) **]
   parapsilosis)
   - Consider changing meropenem for  gram negative coverage as now has
   GNR bacteremia- will d/w ID
   - Continue vancomycin PO for C diff (last positive C diff toxin [**7-18**]),

   # Acute renal failure: Patient started on CVVH on [**9-1**] and switched to
   HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well. Pt had HD line pulled [**9-10**]. Urine output
   difficult to assess given CBI. ARF likely multifactorial ATN given PEA
   arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. Renal U/S did
   not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Plan to place new line perhaps tomorrow
   - Plan for HD after new line placement
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Hyperglycemia: Pt with increase blood glucose into the 300-400
   necessitating pt to be put back on  Insulin gtt o/n

   patient is in status given it waxes and wanes.  Possible shivers from
   her sepsis.  Will cont to monitor and if progresses t/c EEG or repeat
   imaging.
   .
   # Pancytopenia: Secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned
   BMT prior to ICU admission. Multiple known sources of infection,
   including new GNR bacteremia,  [**Month/Year (2) 1542**], C. diff, and yeast. Bone marrow
   biopsy [**9-9**] by report without any cells but still awaiting final
   results
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue meropenem, linezolid, vancomycin PO, and ambisome- talk to
   ID today about possibly adding better GNR coverage.
   - Per ID recs, stopped acyclovir [**9-11**] as marrow suppresant and no
   active viral infection at this

   I saw and examined the patient with the medical resident, reviewed 24
   hour events, and was present during key portions of the services
   provided.  Patient continues critically ill, intubated/ventilated for
   respiratory failure.  Major new events include transfusion of 2 u
   pRBCs, positive blood cultures for GNR on [**11-1**] drawn from the
   midline (which was taken out yesterday).  Continues to require insulin
   drip albeit sugars still >300.  Spiking fevers with rigors this am.
   Not responding to commands.  Lungs with scattered rhonchi, no wheeze.
   Abdomen moderately distended, occ bowel sounds.  Edema unchanged.  ANC
   remains 0. Plts 6K this am albeit having to hold on transfusion given
   rigors.  Now 40 days out from chemoRx. Discussed with heme onc service
   who notes median time for BM to come back after this may be in the
   range of 4 to 6 weeks.  While bone marrow biopsy last week empty may be
   sampling issue and may need to consider repeat biopsy albeit risky
   given low platelets. Now with GNR bacteremia, line has been
   discontinued. Continues broad spectrum antifungals/antibiotics
   including meropenim.  Will discuss redosing with tobra vs other choice
   to broaden gram negative coverage with ID service.  Consider echo to
   rule out vegetations if she continues to have positive cultures,
   possible CT abdomen.  As she continues without recovering her BM
   function she is at increasing risk for further life threatening
   infections with resistant organisms.  Repeat blood cultures today given
   rigors/fever.  Followup on sensitivities once organism identified.
   Discussed arranging another family meeting with patients aunt this
   Thursday, social work to arrange.  Will also request that heme onc be
   available for meeting as aunt is planning on traveling to [**Name (NI) 490**] next
   Monday and she wants to be fully updated on recent course.
   Otherwise agree with assessment and plan as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has multiple medical problems, including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She is currently admitted to the ICU and is intubated and ventilated for respiratory failure. The patient's condition remains critically ill, and she requires continuous medical support.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 141 beats per minute, blood pressure of 143/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological status is altered, and she is not able to provide her own history.

Laboratory results indicate the following abnormalities:
- Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 21.6%
- Platelet count: 98,000/mm3
- White blood cell count: 0.1 K/uL
- Creatinine: 3.6 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 357 mg/dL
- Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
- Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
- LDH: 505 IU/L
- Ca++: 7.8 mg/dL
- Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
- PO4: 4.5 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical complications, including sepsis, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, C. difficile infection, altered mental status, and leukemia. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications to manage these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of central lines.
2. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, and further deterioration in renal function can occur. Continued monitoring of renal parameters and appropriate management are essential.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation, and weaning off the ventilator may be challenging. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
5. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, and there is a need to monitor these parameters closely. Further evaluation and management may be required to address any liver-related issues.

Overall, the patient requires intensive care support and close monitoring to manage her complex medical conditions and prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 MALNUTRITION:  Tube feeds being held for planned procedures.  Will
   need to restart this afternoon.
 EDEMA, PERIPHERAL:  Now with trace edema.  No need for further
   dialysis/ultrafiltration.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Continues on
   mechanical ventilation, minimal secretions.  CXR unchanged, ETT too far
   in, pulled back. Repeat CXR pending.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Creatinine
   continues to improve. However given new hypotension will need to watch
   closely as she is at high risk for ATN. Dosing meds accordingly,
   following tobra levels.
 BACTEREMIA: Persistent gram negative bacteremia.  Plan for TTE and
   abdominal/chest/head CT once hemodynamically stabilized.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Difficult to fully assess
   given persistent infections, toxic metabolic component.  Appreciate
   input from the neurology consultants.  EEG today.  Head CT when more
   stable.
  LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES:  Continue to increase.   [**Month (only) 11**] be
   related to hypotension but concerned that infection may involve liver.
   CT when stable.
 NEUTROPENIA:  No change in counts, now day #41 out from chemotherapy.
   As more time passes it becomes less likely to expect recovery of BM.
 HYPOTENSION: Secondary to blood loss and hypovolemia.  Also given
   multiple positive blood cultures for gram negative rods likley
   component of septic shock.
 ANEMIA SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS:  Persistent active bleeding through
   bladder and possibly vaginal bleeding albeit difficult to distinguish
   from clot around foley catheter coming from bladder.  Will reconsult
   gynecology.  Had recommended lupron in the past.  Also sending labs to
   rule out hemolysis.  Transfuse platelets.
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION):   Septic shock as above
   under hypotension.  Plan for placement of central line under US
   guidance.  Will give FFP for INR 1.7 and platelets prior to procedure
   as well to reduce bleeding complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been experiencing multiple medical complications including sepsis, severe with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, bacteremia, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, neutropenia, hypotension, anemia secondary to blood loss, and peripheral edema.

The patient's condition is critical, and she requires intensive care unit (ICU) care. She is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, and her vital signs are unstable with a blood pressure in the 70s and a heart rate of 138 bpm. She also has a fever of 101.4°F and a decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 25 to 18.

The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, blood transfusions, and insulin infusion for glycemic control. She has also had a central line placed under ultrasound guidance to manage her condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include further deterioration of respiratory function, worsening renal failure, persistent bacteremia leading to sepsis, hepatic dysfunction, and potential bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, infection parameters, and coagulation profile to prevent or manage any potential complications. Additionally, the patient's altered mental status requires ongoing assessment and consultation with neurology specialists for further"

   After rounds today, TF were changed per nutrition recs to Nutren 2.0 at
   35 cc/hr without beneprotein.  Will be holding off on HD line today as
   no acute issues with fluid overload.  Will discuss with urology other
   possible options for getting rid of clot in bladder as this could be a
   nidus for infection.  Will discuss concentrating IV meds with pharmacy
   in light of fluid overload worstening on exam. Will touch base with
   neuro re: final read CT head especially with regard to parietal bleed
   and dilated ventricles.  If hypotension worstens today, will need to
   place CVL for pressors- will give FFP before this procedure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who presented to the ICU with sepsis, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She has been neutropenic with multiple positive blood cultures, including Stenotrophomonas. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including meropenem and linezolid, and has also received ambisome for fungal infection. She is currently unresponsive and requires mechanical ventilation. Her renal function is compromised, and she is on hemodialysis. The patient has a history of hypertension and is on labetalol. She has a papular rash on her forehead, which is likely contact dermatitis. Her bilirubin levels are elevated, and the cause is uncertain. She has coagulopathy due to nutritional deficiency. The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and is being treated with vancomycin. She has a planned bone marrow transplant (BMT) if medically stable and extubated. The patient's family is involved in decision-making, and code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis with multiple positive blood cultures. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's bone marrow suppression due to chemotherapy puts her at risk for further development of pancy"

   failure, and acute renal failure s/p PEA arrest requiring mechanical
   ventilation and hemodialysis.
   # Sepsis: Continues to be neutropenic with [**Name (NI) 1542**] sepsis, fungemia.
   Patient on ambisome since [**9-4**] for yeast coverage for positive blood
   culture on [**9-1**] ([**Female First Name (un) **] PARAPSILOSIS) most recent [**9-6**] growing
   yeast. Patient has persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1542**] bacteremia most recent positive
   culture from [**9-9**], on daptomycin since [**9-4**] - on [**9-9**] started back
   on linezolid given resurrgeance of positive blood cultures.  HD line
   was removed [**9-10**]. TEE without indication of endocarditis [**9-8**].  Now
   growing GNR from blood cx, urine cx [**9-11**] -[**9-14**]  despite being on
   meropenem. Tobramycin given x1 but pt now on day 2 Bactrim therapy for
   likely stenotrophomonas. CT chest yesterday with edema and evidence of
   infiltrates. CT abd and pelvis w/o source of infxn
   - cont Linezolid restarted; daptomycin d/c'ed [**9-10**]
   - Cont ambisome for yeast (last positive culture [**9-2**], [**Female First Name (un) **]
   parapsilosis)
   - On meropenem and now day 2 bactrim for likely stenotrophomonas
   - Continue vancomycin PO for C diff (last positive C diff toxin [**7-18**]),
   flagyl IV
   - Midline removed [**9-12**], PIV
s in place. HD cath removed [**9-7**]
   preliminary read shows no significant growth
   - Continue to monitor daily surveillance cultures
   - [**9-9**] CMV viral load  not detectable
   - Appreciated ID recs
   -Plan for family mtg today to discuss goals of care and if escalation
   in care is appropriate at this time.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient has been off sedation since [**8-29**] with
   continued intermittent unresponsiveness.  Pt currently  not responding
   to commands.  Volume status now + 4.7 L in LOS.  Patient last had HD
   [**9-10**] and currently on line holiday.  Pt w/ some agitation- getting PRN
   ativan, fentanyl. Patient has decent cough/gag with moderate ET
   secretions.
   - Will continue SIMV for now
   - HD on line holiday for now pending management of persistent
   bacteremia
   - Fentanyl prn
   # Acute renal failure: Patient started on CV VH on [**9-1**] and switched
   to HD on [**9-2**]; tolerating well. Pt had HD line pulled [**9-10**]. Urine
   output difficult to assess given CBI. ARF likely multifactorial ATN
   given PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. Renal
   U/S did not reveal hydronephrosis.
   - Hold on new line placement and HD for now- Cr slightly incr at 2.7
   and pt putting out volume but difficult to measure with CBI
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Hyperglycemia: Pt with better glucose control at 260
s o/n
   -cont insulin ss
   #Shaking: Pt with intermittent shaking/twitching per nursing. Unlikely
   patient is in status given it waxes and wanes.  Possible rigors  from
   her sepsis.  EEG to finish today. Cont PRN fentanyl and ativan
   # Pancytopenia: Secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned
   BMT prior to ICU admission. Multiple known sources of infection,
   including new GNR bacteremia,  [**Month/Year (2) 1542**], C. diff, and yeast. Bone marrow
   biopsy [**9-9**] by report without any cells but still awaiting final
   results
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue meropenem, linezolid, vancomycin PO, and ambisome- day 2
   bactrim today
   - Per ID recs, stopped acyclovir [**9-11**] as marrow suppresant and no
   active viral infection at this
   - Transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding- pt to
   get 1units RBCs this am. Awaiting rpt plt to order these
   - f/u final BM biopsy results from [**9-9**]
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria 2wks and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting. Urology consulted recommends ditropan, Tolterodin for
   bladder spasm and cont CBI.
   -Will cont CBI for now
   -Appreciate urology recs
   #Vaginal bleeding: History of vaginal bleeding.
   - Appreciate gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   -Started Lupron o/n. Attempting to get fem ring as well
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding
   # Hypertension: Per records, patient has history of hypertension and
   has been prescribed lopressor as an outpatient. Patient written for
   labetalol, though not requiring currently. Pt currently septic with
   hypotension today

   Likely contact dermatitis. Doesn
t appear to be zoster. Improving.
   - Will cont to monitor.
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: T bili up to 4.7 today- ? [**12-18**] hemolysis. Rpt RUQ
   U/S did not show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated
   Tbili nor did CT abd/pelvis.  Uncertain etiology at this point. Could
   be combination of cholestasis, sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 BACTEREMIA:  Persistent gram negative bacteremia, sensitive to

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Creatinine
   essentially unchanged at 27 despite some hemodynamic instability over
   past 36 horus in setting of sepsis. Dosing medications accordingly.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  No change in ventilatory
   or oxygen requirements.  Still total body fluid overloaded with
   evidence of component of fluid in her lungs on CT. Also concerned about
   underlying pulmonary infection in setting of persistent neutropenia.
   Continues broad spectrum abx.
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 PANCYTOPENIA:  No signs of bone marrow function return
   unfortunately.  Conintues on broad spectrum antibiotic/antifungal
   treatment in setting of prolonged neutropenia.  Transfusing 1 u pRBCs,
   platelets.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  More agitation overnight in
   setting of persistent gram negative bacteremia.  Not clear that small
   bleed on CT contributing.  Enlarged ventricles raises question of
   obstructive process - will review scans with neurology service.  EEG

   We held a family meeting this afternoon with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1109**], myself,
   social work and the patient
s nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. [**Known lastname 366**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1788**] and family
   friend in the room and the patient
s father on the phone from [**Name (NI) 490**]
   The family was updated on the clinical course.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1109**] reviewed
   thte results of the BM biopsy from last Friday, her continued
   susceptibility to recurrent infections despite broad
   antibiotic/antifungal coverage and the new gram negative rods growing
   on multiple blood cultures.  Results of the head CT and EEG were also
   reviewed.  We discussed her labile blood pressure in the setting of GNR
   bacteremia.  The family is aware that even with the appropriate
   antibiotics, given the lack of WBCs she will be unlikely to clear the
   infection. They also understand that as we get farther out from the
   chemoRx, it is becoming less and less likely that her BM will come
   back.  The patient
s [**Last Name (STitle) 1788**] reiterated that her feeling was that Ms. [**Known lastname 366**]
   still has the will to live and that we should continue with the course
   including antibiotics/antifungals, IVFs as needed for hypotension and
   adding pressors if this is not enough, and continuing to readdress need
   for hemodialysis on a daily basis.  Her father and [**Known lastname 1788**] both agreed
   that we should not do chest compressions or shock her if she has an
   life threatening arrhythmia or blood pressure no longer responsive even
   to pressors.  Have changed code status to DNR.     Total time spend 35
   minutes.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent gram-negative bacteremia and is already experiencing sepsis with organ dysfunction. If not managed appropriately, this can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock.

2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible acute renal failure. This could be due to sepsis or other underlying causes. If left untreated, renal failure can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure with diffuse interstitial and alveolar infiltrates seen on CT chest. This suggests pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If not treated promptly, respiratory failure can worsen and lead to hypoxemia and eventual respiratory arrest.

4. Leukemia: The patient has a history of acute leukemia, which is likely contributing to the immunocompromised state and recurrent infections. Without proper management, the leukemia may progress, leading to worsening bone marrow function and increased risk of complications.

5. Pancytopenia: The patient is experiencing pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). This increases the risk of bleeding, infection, and further complications.

6. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, leukemia (ALL), pancytopenia, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, anemia, malnutrition, and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent gram-negative bacteremia and is showing signs of severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. This can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to sepsis or direct damage to the kidneys. Proper fluid management and renal support are necessary.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has not improved, and they are still experiencing total body fluid overload with evidence of fluid in the lungs on CT. Underlying pulmonary infection should be considered, especially with persistent neutropenia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued.
4. Leukemia (ALL): The patient has leukemia (ALL), and there are no signs of bone marrow function return. This may contribute to the patient's overall poor condition and susceptibility to infections.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which means a decrease in all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). This increases the risk of bleeding,"

   patient is in status given it waxes and wanes.  Possible rigors  from
   her sepsis.  EEG to finish today. Cont PRN fentanyl and ativan
   # Pancytopenia: Secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned
   BMT prior to ICU admission. Multiple known sources of infection,
   including new GNR bacteremia,  [**Month/Year (2) 1542**], C. diff, and yeast. Bone marrow
   biopsy [**9-9**] by report without any cells but still awaiting final
   results
   - Continue Neuopogen
   - Continue meropenem, linezolid, vancomycin PO, and ambisome- day 2
   bactrim today
   - Per ID recs, stopped acyclovir [**9-11**] as marrow suppresant and no
   active viral infection at this
   - Transfuse for HCT<21 or Plt<10 or higher if signs of bleeding- pt to
   get 1units RBCs this am. Awaiting rpt plt to order these
   - f/u final BM biopsy results from [**9-9**]
   # Hematuria: Pt with hematuria 2wks and clots. Currently on CBI to
   prevent clotting. Urology consulted recommends ditropan, Tolterodin for
   bladder spasm and cont CBI.
   -Will cont CBI for now
   -Appreciate urology recs
   #Vaginal bleeding: History of vaginal bleeding.
   - Appreciate gyn input
   - Discontinued estraderm
 should expect some withdrawal bleeding
   -Started Lupron o/n. Attempting to get fem ring as well
   - Transfuse plts if active bleeding

   U/S did not show signs of hepatobiliary pathology causing elevated
   Tbili nor did CT abd/pelvis.  Uncertain etiology at this point. Could
   be combination of cholestasis, sepsis,  bowel edema.
   - Trend LFTs, bilirubin
   # Coagulopathy: Elevated INR but not on anticoagulation. Likely
   secondary to nutritional deficiency.
   - Monitor coags
   # C. Diff: Last positive C. diff toxin on [**2135-7-18**].
   - Continue PO vanco (pt with decreased gut motility)
 will need for 2
   weeks beyond completion of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Discontinued flagyl as she is covered for anaerobes with meropenem
   # ALL: s/p recent chemo, at count nadirs. Plan is to ultimately perform
   BM transplant if patient medically stable, extubated, out of the ICU
   and has functional status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and multiple medical problems. She has been admitted to the ICU with sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis.

The patient has had persistent bacteremia despite being on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and linezolid. She has also had positive cultures for yeast and C. difficile. Bone marrow biopsy results are pending.

The patient's condition remains unstable with intermittent unresponsiveness, moderate ET secretions, and difficulty in measuring urine output due to central venous catheterization (CBI). The patient's blood counts are very low, indicating severe pancytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic with ongoing bacteremia and fungemia, indicating a high risk for further infection and sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with intermittent unresponsiveness and moderate ET secretions. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and difficulty in assessing urine output. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's blood counts are"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old overweight/obese female with a chief complaint of sepsis and pancytopenia. She has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other medications. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin, amoxicillin, omeprazole, and an unknown allergy to aspirin. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 107/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute (on mechanical ventilation), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's blood cultures were taken on 09/15/2135 at 10:00 AM and 01:20 PM, and again on 09/16/2135 at 04:30 AM. 

The patient has been placed on a multi-lumen line, right internal jugular (IJ) placed, and has had temporary hemodialysis (HD) catheter placement. She also has an endotracheal tube in place for mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood products have been given, including one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and one unit of platelets. 

The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.1 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.9 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 22 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 2."

   was removed [**9-10**]. TEE without indication of endocarditis [**9-8**].  Now
   growing GNR from blood cx, urine cx [**9-11**] -[**9-14**]  despite being on
   meropenem. Tobramycin given x1 but pt now on day 2 Bactrim therapy for
   likely stenotrophomonas. CT chest yesterday with edema and evidence of
   infiltrates. CT abd and pelvis w/o source of infxn
   - cont Linezolid restarted; daptomycin d/c'ed [**9-10**]
   - Cont ambisome for yeast (last positive culture [**9-2**], [**Female First Name (un) **]
   parapsilosis)
   - On meropenem and now day 2 bactrim for likely stenotrophomonas
   - Continue vancomycin PO for C diff (last positive C diff toxin [**7-18**]),
   flagyl IV
   - Midline removed [**9-12**], PIV
s in place. HD cath removed [**9-7**]
   preliminary read shows no significant growth
   - Continue to monitor daily surveillance cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented to the ICU with sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She has multiple medical problems and is currently on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. The patient is neutropenic with ongoing bacteremia and fungemia, despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has a history of C. difficile infection and yeast infection. Her respiratory status is unstable, and she requires SIMV ventilation. She also has acute renal failure, likely due to multi-factorial causes including ATN, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. The patient's blood counts are low secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned bone marrow transplant (BMT). She has a papular rash on her forehead, likely contact dermatitis. Her bilirubin levels are elevated, and there is a possibility of cholestasis or sepsis-related liver dysfunction. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, likely due to nutritional deficiency. The patient has a history of hypertension and vaginal bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic with ongoing bacteremia and fungemia, which puts her at high risk for further infections and sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she requires SIMV ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated"

   Assessment and Plan
 BACTEREMIA:  No positive blood cultures since [**9-13**].  Continues broad
   spectrum antibiotics including bactrim.  Cultures sent again on [**9-15**]
   and [**9-16**].  More hemodynamically stable, no further rigors, may be
   clearing infection.  Persistently febrile.
 PANCYTOPENIA: Requiring increasing blood products over past 24
   hours.
 MALNUTRITION: High residuals, tube feeds on hold.
 EDEMA, PERIPHERAL: Total body fluid overloaded.  Now that
   hemodynamically stable will readdress HD with renal service. Patient
   will need to go to IR for placement of dialysis catheter.  Also with
   increasing BUN/Cr, acidosis.  Elevated BUN may be contributing to
   delerium as well as platelet dysfunction.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE on CHRONIC (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]): Volume overload
   and possible infection limiting wean.  Plan to reconsider dialysis and
   volume removal with renal service.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Worsening in setting
   of recent hemodynamic instability, component of prerenal azotemia/ATN.
   Now [**Last Name (LF) 1805**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] follow.
 HEMATURIA:  Continues CBI.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Improved today, may be that
   infection is improving.  Plan for repeat head CT to followup on
   ventricle enlargement and small occipital bleed on [**9-18**] unless
   clinically changed.
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM): Day #44 s/p
   chemoRx without evidence of counts returning.  Prognosis poor.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with pancytopenia, respiratory failure, volume overload, and acute renal failure. They have a history of malignancy and have undergone chemotherapy. The patient's condition is complicated by bacteremia, malnutrition, peripheral edema, altered mental status, and hematuria. The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and bacteremia indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Bleeding: Pancytopenia, characterized by low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, increases the risk of bleeding. The patient may require blood product transfusions to maintain adequate blood cell counts.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure, along with volume overload, may predispose them to ARDS, a life-threatening lung condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
4. Renal Failure: The worsening renal function, indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels, suggests acute renal failure. This can further complicate the patient's condition and require dialysis for renal support.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status, potentially due to infection, electrolyte imbalances, or medication effects, increases the risk of delirium. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications associated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently in the ICU. She has multiple medical problems including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. She has had positive blood cultures for various bacteria, including Stenotrophomonas, and is currently on multiple antibiotics. Her condition remains unstable, and she is not responding to commands. The patient's family has been informed of her prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing sepsis despite being on multiple antibiotics, indicating a potential risk of continued infection and septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is currently on SIMV (synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation) mode. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration and the need for tracheostomy.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely multifactorial in origin, including PEA (pulmonary embolism) arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for continued hemodialysis.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has severe pancytopenia secondary to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned bone marrow transplantation. There is a risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has multiple medical problems, including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and requires mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient continues to be neutropenic with ongoing sepsis and bacteremia. She has positive blood cultures for various organisms, including Stenotrophomonas, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been off sedation but remains intermittently unresponsive. She is responding to some commands and has a decent cough/gag reflex with moderate endotracheal tube (ET) secretions. She is currently on assist control ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient started on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) on [9-1] and switched to intermittent hemodialysis (HD) on [9-2]-[9-9]. Her urine output is difficult to assess due to ongoing catheterization. ARF is likely multifactorial, including ATN due to PEA arrest, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast exposure.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has secondary pancytopenia due to bone marrow ablation therapy for planned bone"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented to the ICU with multiple medical problems including sepsis, fungemia, pancytopenia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and was intubated. The patient has been mechanically ventilated and has required hemodialysis. She continues to be neutropenic with persistent bacteremia and fungemia. The patient's condition is complicated by various complications such as C. difficile infection, yeast infection, GNR bacteremia, and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing sepsis with multiple positive blood cultures, indicating a persistent bacterial infection. This can lead to further organ dysfunction and increased risk of mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). There is a risk of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia due to bone marrow ablation therapy. This increases the risk of bleeding and infection.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's chief complaint is sepsis, indicating a systemic infection that has led to widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation support, indicating respiratory failure. This may be due to the patient's inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Kidney Injury): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output suggest acute kidney injury, which could be caused by factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.

4. Bacteremia: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests a bacterial infection in the bloodstream, contributing to the patient's septic state.

5. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI): The patient's history of antibiotic use and symptoms like diarrhea indicate a possible CDI, which is a common cause of antibiotic-associated colitis.

6. Altered Mental Status (not delirium): The patient's unresponsiveness and abnormal mental status warrant further investigation, as it could be related to various factors such as sepsis, medication effects, or underlying neurological conditions.

7. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood counts (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopen"
