 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   78M w DM2, PVD, CAD, afib, intially presented for falls, hospital
   course complicated by MSSA bacteremia from presumed foot source,
   seeding of sternal joint and possibly lumbar epidural space, now with
   new hematemesis.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Intermittent n/v through admission, previously
   nonbloody, then developed coffee ground emesis. Is now s/p 9U although
   Hct doesn't appear to have corrected appropriately with Hct initially
   falling after first transfusion and currently at 26.5 after multriple
   transfusions yesterday. EGD yesterday am showing ulcer that was
   injected and cauterized, with further recs to continue 48hrs of IV PPI
   and repeat EGD in 6wks with Bx.
   --Pt currently still only with R PICC and L AC PIV, would strongly
   consider another large bore PIV if Hct does not stabilize
   --T&S outdates [**2174-11-15**]
   --Has 2U crossmatched
   --Transfuse for <25 or active bleeding
   --F/u INR this am, is normalizing
   --Continuing IV PPI
   --Will need f/u EGD in 6 wks
   --Zofran prn
   --Advanced diet overnight to clears
   --Avoid narcotics contributing to ileus --> pain currently controlled
   with Tylenol and Fentanyl
   --Continue iron supplementation for chronic iron deficiency component
   (last colonoscopy [**2171**], multiple polypectomy)
   --Holding Lisinopril and Metoprolol, will add back as necessary
   --Has not been getting outpt Lasix regimen in house, will use prn for
   resp distress with transfusions
   .
   #) Bacteremia: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg daily since. Source
   thought to be LE ulcers given x-ray with possibility of lucency/osteo
   vs sternoclavicular joint post trauma given same organism growing
   (unclear which came first). Other sources ruled out with neg UA and
   TEE. Now complicated by lumber MRI concerning for septic facet,
   discitis and paraspinal abscess.
   --Have decreased Cefazolin to 1g IV q8 per ID recs as may have
   contributed to n/v but can increase back to 2g IV q8 if without
   continued n/v
   --Continue nonsurgical management of sternoclavicular joint infection
   per thoracic
   --Per neurosurgery, no plan for intervention given normal neuro exam.
   Recommend repeat MRI with STIR given poor quality of initial film(will
   likely need to be intubated). If clinically worsens consider fluero
   aspiration of L4 fluid by IR.
   -- Regular neuro checks (q4 for now)
   -- consider CT abdomen/pelvis to look for psoas abscess or R foot MR
   for osteo to further eval of source and/or complication
   -- can stop surveillance cultures, f/u prior BCx until finalized
   -- wound care of R plantar foot ulcer per podiatry
   --Was receiving Ketorolac for pain but not well controlled, have now
   switched to Fentanyl
   .
   #) Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   --BS's well controlled in the 100's through yesterday
   --Continue to watch finger sticks
   -- Advanced to clears
   .
   #) Atrial Fibrillation:
   -- Holding coumadin and metoprolol
   --Will need to add back Metoprolol if RVR or HTN
   .
   #) CAD: no active chest pain
   -- continue statin, holding BB, ACEi, ASA
   -- monitor EKGs prn
   -- if active chest pain, decrease threshold for transfusion
   .
   FEN: Advanced to clear overnight, lytes prn, IVF/blood products prn
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx: was supratherapeutic on coumadin, now INR 1.2 but will hold
   subQ heparin given recent bleed
   -Bowel regimen: was held while NPO, have now restarted since taking

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted initially for falls and developed MSSA bacteremia from a presumed foot source, which also seeded the sternoclavicular joint and possibly the lumbar epidural space. The patient presented with new hematemesis, and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) showed a non-bleeding ulcer with a blood clot in the antrum. The patient received epinephrine injection at the ulcer edge and had the area cauterized. The patient is currently being treated for gastrointestinal bleed, pain control, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has experienced intermittent vomiting of blood (hematemesis) and has a history of melena. The EGD revealed a non-bleeding ulcer with a blood clot in the antrum. There is a risk of recurrent bleeding, and the patient may require further interventions such as repeat EGD with biopsy or surgical intervention if conservative measures fail.
2. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) with Critical Limb Ischemia: The patient has a history of PVD and critical limb ischemia, which increases the risk of limb loss and potential amputation if blood flow to the affected limb does not improve.
3. Bacteremia and Infections:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and intial presentation for falls. The patient has been hospitalized for falls and had a complicated course including MSSA bacteremia from a presumed foot source, seeding of the sternoclavicular joint, and possibly the lumbar epidural space. Currently, the patient is admitted to the MICU with hematemesis and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed a bleeding ulcer. The patient has received multiple transfusions but the hemoglobin level has not stabilized appropriately. The patient's condition includes peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, gastrointestinal bleed (melena, GI bleed, GIB), and pain control (acute pain, chronic pain).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematemesis: The patient has been experiencing intermittent vomiting of blood (hematemesis) throughout their admission. This indicates ongoing bleeding from the ulcer.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed (GIB): The bleeding ulcer visualized during EGD is likely the source of the severe upper gastrointestinal bleed (GIB).
3. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) with Critical Limb Ischemia: The patient has a history of PVD, which is causing critical limb ischemia. This condition can lead to tissue damage and potentially require amputation if not managed promptly.
4. Pain Control: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and previous falls. The patient initially presented for falls and had a hospital course complicated by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia from a presumed foot source, seeding of the sternal joint, and possibly the lumbar epidural space. The patient was admitted to the MICU with hematemesis and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed a bleeding ulcer.

The patient has experienced intermittent nausea and vomiting throughout the admission, which was initially attributed to narcotics but is now believed to be due to severe peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The ulcer has been injected and cauterized, and the patient has been prescribed 48 hours of intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy with a repeat EGD in 6 weeks.

The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been monitored closely, as they initially fell after the first transfusion and currently stand at 24.1%. The patient has received multiple transfusions, but the Hct levels have not stabilized. The plan is to continue frequent Hct checks every 6 hours, transfuse for Hct <25 or active bleeding, and obtain a follow-up INR this morning, which is normalizing.

   78M w DM2, PVD, CAD, afib, intially presented for falls, hospital
   course complicated by MSSA bacteremia from presumed foot source,
   seeding of sternal joint and possibly lumbar epidural space, now
   admitted to MICU with hematemesis and s/p EGD with bleeding ulcer
   visualized. It is likely the pt
s continued n/v on the floor was less
   likely due to narcotics and probably due to severe PUD, and the ulcer
   finally opened up.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Intermittent n/v through admission, previously
   nonbloody, then developed coffee ground emesis. Is now s/p 9U although
   Hct doesn't appear to have corrected appropriately with Hct initially
   falling after first transfusion and currently at 26.5 after multriple
   transfusions yesterday. EGD yesterday am showing ulcer that was
   injected and cauterized, with further recs to continue 48hrs of IV PPI
   and repeat EGD in 6wks with Bx.
   No current symptoms (no n/v, no hematemesis, no BRBPR, no melena). Now
   s/p 9U without much of an increase in Hct. Was 26 through yesterday and
   seen to be 24 this am.
   --Pt currently still only with R PICC and L AC PIV, would strongly
   consider another large bore PIV if Hct does not stabilize
   --T&S outdates [**2174-11-15**]
   --Has 2U crossmatched
   --Hct checks q6hrs
   --Transfuse for <25 or active bleeding
   --F/u INR this am, is normalizing
   --Get H. Pylori Ab serology
   --Continuing IV PPI
   --Will need f/u EGD in 6 wks
   --Zofran prn
   --Advanced diet overnight to clears
   --Avoid narcotics contributing to ileus --> pain currently controlled
   with Tylenol and Fentanyl
   --Continue iron supplementation for chronic iron deficiency component
   (last colonoscopy [**2171**], multiple polypectomy)

   thought to be LE ulcers given x-ray with possibility of lucency/osteo
   vs sternoclavicular joint post trauma given same organism growing
   (unclear which came first). Other sources ruled out with neg UA and
   TEE. Now complicated by lumber MRI concerning for septic facet,
   discitis and paraspinal abscess.
   --Have decreased Cefazolin to 1g IV q8 per ID recs as may have
   contributed to n/v but will  increase back to 2g IV q8 if without
   continued n/v
   --Continue nonsurgical management of sternoclavicular joint infection
   per thoracic
   --Per neurosurgery, no plan for intervention given normal neuro exam.
   --Pt unlikely to be able to tolerate long MRI without
   intubation/sedation and doubt that visualizing an epidural abscess
   would change the course of an already long course of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will not
   proceed to further imaging of L spine unless neurologically
   deteriorates or pt acutely decompensates.
   --If clinically worsens consider fluero aspiration of L4 fluid by IR.
   -- Regular neuro checks (q4 for now)
   -- consider CT abdomen/pelvis to look for psoas abscess or R foot MR
   for osteo to further eval of source and/or complication
 again, unsure
   this would change course of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on this for now and
   continue IV [**First Name3 (LF) **] as is.
   -- can stop surveillance cultures, f/u prior BCx until finalized
   -- wound care of R plantar foot ulcer per podiatry
   --Was receiving Ketorolac for pain but not well controlled, have now
   switched to Fentanyl
   #) Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   --BS's well controlled in the 100's through yesterday
   --Continue to watch finger sticks
   -- Advanced to clears

   #) Atrial Fibrillation:
   -- Holding coumadin due to recent GIB
   -- Have added back Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   .

An EGD yesterday morning showed an ulcer that was injected and cauterized, with further recommendations to continue 48 hours of intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and repeat EGD in 6 weeks with biopsy.

The patient has no current symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bleeding, or bloody stools. His vital signs are stable, but his blood pressure is on the lower side. He has a history of bacteremia with MSSA, which is now negative. He also has a lumbar epidural abscess, but no plan for intervention has"

   likely due to narcotics and probably due to severe PUD, and the ulcer
   finally opened up.
   #) Hematemesis: Intermittent n/v through admission, previously
   nonbloody, then developed coffee ground emesis. Is now s/p 9U although
   Hct doesn't appear to have corrected appropriately with Hct initially
   falling after first transfusion and currently at 26.5 after multriple

   No current symptoms (no n/v, no hematemesis, no BRBPR, no melena). Now
   s/p 8U without much of an increase in Hct. Was 26 through yesterday and
   seen to be 24 this am, so will transfuse the 9U this am and f/u Hct. If

   --Cefazolin back up to 2g IV q8 after briefly being dropped to 1g IV q8
   due to concern that it was contributing to n/v.
   #) Pain
We were avoiding narcotics as they were thought to be
   contributing to n/v, but with EGD evidence of bleeding ulcer, it seems
   more likely that the ulcer/blood was causing his n/v and not the
   narcotics. Therefore were giving him Fentanyl but yesterday also
   received Percocet with good effect and will continue Percocet and
   frequent repositioning for pain control.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The patient presented with hematemesis (vomiting blood) and has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, gastrointestinal bleed, and pain management needs. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating anemia likely due to blood loss. The patient's sodium level is high, suggesting hypernatremia. The patient has been receiving proton pump inhibitor therapy and is awaiting results for H. pylori testing. The patient's condition appears to be improving, with reduced nausea, better pain control, and stable vital signs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and anemia. There is a risk of re-bleeding and potential need for further endoscopic intervention.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium level indicates hypernatremia. If not managed properly, this can result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially neurological complications.
3. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, which requires careful management of blood glucose levels to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient's critical limb ischemia due to PVD puts them at risk for limb loss and other complications such as infection or non-healing wounds.
5. Pain Management: The patient requires effective pain management to alleviate acute and chronic pain, prevent further complications, and improve overall well-being.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues if not corrected.
7. Infection: As a critically ill patient, the patient is at increased risk for infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). Prophylactic measures are in place to minimize these risks.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided medical progress note. Further evaluation and testing may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition."
