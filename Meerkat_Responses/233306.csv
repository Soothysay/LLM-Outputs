   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:
   50 yo male with history of HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia was admitted from
   the ED with hypoxic respiratory distress now with ARDs picture
   PLAN:
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Etiology of patient's hypoxic
   respiratory distress appears most likely infectious in etiology given
   elevated WBC, bandemia, and fever. Viral possibilities include
   influenza most likely, although additional possibilities include
   adenovirus, paraflu, and RSV. Bacterial pathogens include atypical
   infections such as mycoplasma pneumoniae or chlamydia, although typical
   infections include strep pneumo, legionella. PCP unlikely since CD4
   count is adequate.   Additional possibility includes infection
   resulting in COPD exacerbation given scattered wheezes throughout.
   Patient in respiratory distress last night dropping oxygen saturation
   on NRB and was urgently intubaetd
   - Vent goals: currently 600x20, 80% PEEP 10. Patients CXR and p02/fio2
   is >200, unlikely cardiac. will adjust to ARDSNEt goals, for fio O2 of
   80 PEEP should be 14. for peep of 14, Fio2 should be 70.
   - f/u DFA and Respiratory antigen panel
   - f/u sputum gram stain and culture
   - f/u urine legionella given GI symptoms and hyponatremia
   - start ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin for community aquired
   typical and atypical coverage
   - cefepime for pseudomonas if viral cultures are negative and patient
   not improving
   - standing nebulizer treatments
   - PFTs as an outpatient
   2. Fever
   Etiology appears most likely secondary to pneumonia, although
   additional possibilities include viral gastroenteritis given vague
   history of diarrhea and vomiting, urinary tract infection given
   occasional bacteria and WBCs on UA. Unfortunately antibiotics given
   prior to urine culture being sent.
   - continue ceftriaxone, vancomcyin, and azithromycin for presumptive
   treatment of pneumonia
   - send urine and sputum culture
   - follow-up blood culture
   3. Hyponatremia - resolved this AM, likely secondary to NS in ED
   Etiology is likely secondary to hypovolemia given evidence of
   dehydration - history of decreased PO intake, likely increased
   insensible losses with fever, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, and
   dry mucous membranes. Given worsening hypoxia, hesitant to further
   aggressively resuscitate.
   - send Uosm, Sosm
   - slowly rehydrate with an additional IVF bolus
   4. Acid Base Status
   This AM, his gas and panel seem consistent with acute respiratory
   acidosis and metabolic acidosis.
   - continue to treat pneumonia with antibiotics
   - adjust vent settings according to ARDsNET
   5. HIV
   Hold HAART therapy in the setting of acute illness

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress, which appears to have an infectious etiology given the elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and fever. The possible causes of hypoxic respiratory distress include viral infections such as influenza, adenovirus, paraflu, and RSV, as well as bacterial pathogens like atypical infections (Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia) and typical infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae or Legionella). PCP is unlikely since the CD4 count is adequate. The patient's oxygen saturation dropped last night, leading to urgent intubation. The current ventilator settings are set at 600 mL tidal volume with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, 80% FiO2, and 10 cmH2O PEEP. Additional possibilities include infection resulting in a COPD exacerbation due to scattered wheezes throughout. 

The patient has a fever, which is likely secondary to pneumonia, although other possibilities include viral gastroenteritis or urinary tract infection. Antibiotics have already been started for presumptive treatment of pneumonia. Blood cultures have been sent, and sputum and urine cultures are pending. The patient also has hyponatremia, which resolved this morning and is likely due to NSAID use in the emergency department. This is further supported by evidence of dehydration."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:
   50 yo male with history of HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia was admitted from
   the ED with hypoxic respiratory distress now with ARDs picture
   requiring significant vent support.
   PLAN:
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Etiology of patient's hypoxic
   respiratory distress appears most likely infectious in etiology given
   elevated WBC, bandemia, and fever. Viral possibilities include
   influenza most likely, although additional possibilities include
   adenovirus, paraflu, and RSV. Bacterial pathogens include atypical
   infections such as mycoplasma pneumoniae or chlamydia, although typical
   infections include strep pneumo, legionella. PCP unlikely since CD4
   count is adequate.   Additional possibility includes infection
   resulting in COPD exacerbation given scattered wheezes throughout. Now
   intubated with ARDS strategy
   - Vent goals: Adjusting to ARDSNEt goals, for fio O2 of 80 PEEP should
   be 14. for peep of 14, Fio2 should be 70. Goal Vt is 480 (by height).
   Currently with resp acidosis (likely [**2-20**] fever with increased work of
   breathin will allow for some degree of permissive hypercapnia). Will
   follow ABG carefully.
   - f/u DFA and Respiratory antigen panel. Empiric treatment with
   tamiflu.
   - f/u sputum gram stain and culture. F/u PCP as well (not empirically
   treating at present, CD4 900). Looks like gram stain + or GPC in pairs
   and clusters.
   - f/u urine legionella given GI symptoms and hyponatremia
   - currently on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin for community
   aquired typical and atypical coverage
   - will stop ceftriaxone and azithro and start Zosyn and Levoflox for
   pseudomonas.
   - standing nebulizer treatment. Hold on steroids for PCP or COPD flare
   for now.
   - not stable enough to bronch at present.
   - Other sources: urine appears dirty (he'c covered adequately for now,
   new urine pending), also with diarrhea (could be PNA, will check c.
   dif)
   2. Fever
   Etiology appears most likely secondary to pneumonia, although
   additional possibilities include viral gastroenteritis given vague
   history of diarrhea and vomiting, urinary tract infection given
   occasional bacteria and WBCs on UA. Unfortunately antibiotics given
   prior to urine culture being sent.   We also need to consider the
   possibility of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (despite his report of preserved CD4 count).
   - coverage as above
   - follow up cultures
   - cooling blanket for now (goal temp < 101 oral)
   2a. Sepsis:  goal UOP greater .5 cc/kg/hr, CVP goal of 14-16, MAP > 60,
   follow lactate and mixed venous sat. Will obtain central access.
   3. Hyponatremia - resolved this AM
   Etiology is likely secondary to hypovolemia given evidence of
   dehydration - history of decreased PO intake, likely increased
   insensible losses with fever, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, and
   dry mucous membranes. Given worsening hypoxia, hesitant to further
   aggressively resuscitate.
   - slowly rehydrate with an additional IVF bolus (LR as preferred to
   NS).
   4. Acid Base Status
   This AM, his gas and panel seem consistent with acute respiratory
   acidosis and metabolic acidosis.
   - continue to treat pneumonia with antibiotics
   - adjust vent settings according to ARDsNET. Fever likely contributing
   to his increase resp drive.
   - Non gap acidosis: hyperchloremic (HCO3 deficit).
   - renal function ok (myalgias and blood in urine, will check CK)
   5. HIV
   Hold HAART therapy in the setting of acute
   6.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress and is now showing signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs indicate fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.6 K/uL, bandemia, and elevated lactate levels. The chest X-ray reveals progression of bilateral infiltrates with opacification of the right middle lobe (RML) and lingula. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a non-rebreather mask and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 80%. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient is being treated empirically with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin for community-acquired typical and atypical coverage. However, due to the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on the sputum gram stain, coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae is also being considered."

   2a. Sepsis:  goal UOP greater .5 cc/kg/hr, CVP goal of 14-16, MAP > 60,
   follow lactate and mixed venous sat. Will obtain central access.
   3. Hyponatremia - resolved this AM
   Etiology is likely secondary to hypovolemia given evidence of
   dehydration - history of decreased PO intake, likely increased
   insensible losses with fever, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, and
   dry mucous membranes. Given worsening hypoxia, hesitant to further
   aggressively resuscitate.
   - slowly rehydrate with an additional IVF bolus (LR as preferred to
   NS).
   4. Acid Base Status
   This AM, his gas and panel seem consistent with acute respiratory
   acidosis and metabolic acidosis.  Renal function is normal
   - continue to treat pneumonia with antibiotics
   - adjust vent settings according to ARDsNET. Fever likely contributing
   to his increase resp drive.
   - Non gap acidosis: hyperchloremic (HCO3 deficit).
   - renal function ok (myalgias and blood in urine, will check CK)

   Hold HAART therapy in the setting of acute

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and now presents with an ARDS picture requiring significant ventilator support.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress appears to be primarily due to an infectious etiology, with elevated WBC and bandemia, suggesting a bacterial or viral infection. Viral possibilities include influenza, adenovirus, paraflu, and RSV. Bacterial pathogens include atypical infections like mycoplasma pneumoniae or chlamydia, typical infections such as strep pneumo, and legionella. PCP is less likely given the patient's adequate CD4 count.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is intubated with an ARDS strategy. The vent goals are being adjusted according to ARDSNET goals, with a target PEEP of 14 and FiO2 of 70 for a given Vt. The plan includes following ABG closely, DFA, and respiratory antigen panel. Empiric treatment with tamiflu is being given, and sputum gram stain and culture are being followed up. Additionally, the patient is being treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin for community-acquired typical and atypical coverage, which will"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:
   50 yo male with history of HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia was admitted from
   the ED with hypoxic respiratory distress now with ARDs picture
   requiring significant vent support.
   PLAN:
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Etiology of patient's hypoxic
   respiratory distress appears most likely infectious in etiology given
   elevated WBC, bandemia, and fever. Viral possibilities include
   influenza most likely, although additional possibilities include
   adenovirus, paraflu, and RSV. Bacterial pathogens include atypical
   infections such as mycoplasma pneumoniae or chlamydia, although typical
   infections include strep pneumo, legionella. PCP unlikely since CD4
   count is adequate.   Additional possibility includes infection
   resulting in COPD exacerbation given scattered wheezes throughout. Now
   intubated with ARDS strategy
   - Vent goals: Adjusting to ARDSNEt goals, for fio O2 of 80 PEEP should
   be 14. for peep of 14, Fio2 should be 70. Goal Vt is 480 (by height).
   Currently with resp acidosis (likely [**2-20**] fever with increased work of
   breathin will allow for some degree of permissive hypercapnia). Will
   follow ABG carefully. [**Month (only) 51**] use esophageal balloon to guide PEEP, likely
   will benefit from PEEP greater than ARDSnet suggests.
   - f/u DFA and Respiratory antigen panel. Empiric treatment with
   tamiflu.
   - f/u sputum gram stain and culture. F/u PCP as well (not empirically
   treating at present, CD4 900). Looks like gram stain + or GPC in pairs
   and clusters.
   - f/u urine legionella given GI symptoms and hyponatremia
   - currently on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin for community
   aquired typical and atypical coverage
   - will stop ceftriaxone and azithro and start Cefepime, Vanco and
   Levoflox for pseudomonas.
   - standing nebulizer treatment. Hold on steroids for PCP or COPD flare
   for now.
   - not stable enough to bronch at present.
   - Other sources: urine appears dirty (he'c covered adequately for now,
   new urine pending), also with diarrhea (could be PNA, will check c.
   dif)
   2. Fever
   Etiology appears most likely secondary to pneumonia, although
   additional possibilities include viral gastroenteritis given vague
   history of diarrhea and vomiting, urinary tract infection given
   occasional bacteria and WBCs on UA. Unfortunately antibiotics given
   prior to urine culture being sent.   We also need to consider the
   possibility of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (despite his report of preserved CD4 count).
   - coverage as above
   - follow up cultures
   - cooling blanket for now (goal temp < 101 oral)
   2a. Sepsis:  goal UOP greater .5 cc/kg/hr, CVP goal of 14-16, MAP > 60,
   follow lactate and mixed venous sat. Will obtain central access.
   3. Hyponatremia - resolved this AM
   Etiology is likely secondary to hypovolemia given evidence of
   dehydration - history of decreased PO intake, likely increased
   insensible losses with fever, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, and
   dry mucous membranes. Given worsening hypoxia, hesitant to further
   aggressively resuscitate.
   - slowly rehydrate with an additional IVF bolus (LR as preferred to
   NS).
   4. Acid Base Status
   This AM, his gas and panel seem consistent with acute respiratory
   acidosis and metabolic acidosis.  Renal function is normal
   - continue to treat pneumonia with antibiotics
   - adjust vent settings according to ARDsNET. Fever likely contributing
   to his increase resp drive.
   - Non gap acidosis: hyperchloremic (HCO3 deficit).
   - renal function ok (myalgias and blood in urine, will check CK)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and previous PCP pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress and is now displaying signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs indicate fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. His oxygen saturation is at 93% and he requires increasing PEEP support on the ventilator. The patient's chest X-ray shows progressive bilateral infiltrates with opacification of the right middle lobe and lingula. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to an infectious etiology, possibly viral or bacterial pneumonia. Other possibilities include COPD exacerbation. The patient is intubated and on ARDS strategy with ventilation goals adjusted accordingly.
2. Fever: The etiology of the fever is most likely secondary to pneumonia, but other possibilities include viral gastroenteritis or urinary tract infection. PCP should also be considered despite the preserved CD4 count.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis given his elevated lactate levels, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. Goal UOP, CVP, and MAP should be maintained, and central access should be obtained.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient had resolved hy"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, now diagnosed with ARDS caused by Legionella. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for management of these conditions.

The patient received a total of 3,115 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 2,275 mL of urine and 690 mL of other losses. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 39.8°C (103.7°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/64 mmHg to 163/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, platelet count of 272 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose level of 128 mg/dL. The troponin T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is 37.0 mg/dL.

Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray, are pending. Microbiology tests reveal a positive urine Legionella test and negative respiratory viral antigen test.

The patient's management plan includes adjusting ventilator settings to maintain adequate oxygenation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, PCP pneumonia, and now ARDS. He has been experiencing fever and has received various antibiotics for suspected bacterial pulmonary infection. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, slightly elevated blood pressure, and decreased urine output.

The patient is currently receiving respiratory support through mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, PEEP of 16 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 80%. The arterial blood gas results indicate a slightly elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and decreased partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 ratio.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, and normal kidney function. Imaging tests such as chest X-ray and microbiology cultures are pending.

The patient's current assessment and plan include management of respiratory status with adjustments to ventilator settings, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and awaiting culture results. Other interventions include fever management, sepsis source control, holding HAART due to acute illness, and ICU care including nutrition support, glycemic control, and line management.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:
   50 yo male with history of HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia was admitted from
   the ED with hypoxic respiratory distress now with ARDs picture
   requiring significant vent support found to have positive urine
   legionella.  Has continued to require very high levels of Vent support.
   PLAN:
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Etiology of patient's hypoxic
   respiratory distress appears most likely infectious in etiology given
   elevated WBC, bandemia, and fever. Now with pos urine legionella.,PCP
   remains unlikely since CD4 count is adequate.   Additional
   contributions includes infection resulting in COPD exacerbation given
   scattered wheezes throughout. Now intubated with ARDS strategy
   - Vent goals: Adjusting to ARDSNEt goals, for fio O2 of 80 PEEP should
   be 14. for peep of 14, Fio2 should be 70. Goal Vt is 480 (by height).
   Currently with resp acidosis (likely [**2-20**] fever with increased work of
   breathin will allow for some degree of permissive hypercapnia). Will
   follow ABG carefully. [**Month (only) 51**] use esophageal balloon to guide PEEP, likely
   will benefit from PEEP greater than ARDSnet suggests. Esophageal
   balloon placed [**4-25**] AM (pressures have been variable, with TPP of 15
   range). We may need to paralyze to optimze vent function and consider
   alternative strategy (APRV etc). I am also concerned about him being
   volume down and creating more zone 1 lung zone (first we will try to
   get CVP > 16 and see if there are any effects on his oxygenation)
   - DFA and Respiratory antigen panel (neg) stopped tamiflu.
   - f/u sputum gram stain and culture: Looks like gram stain + or GPC in
   pairs and clusters, Clx pending (legionella Pos in urine)
   - Continue Cefepime, Vanco and Levoflox until neg sputum clx (may be a
   super infection present)
   - standing nebulizer treatment. Hold on steroids for PCP or COPD flare
   for now.
   - Other sources: urine appears dirty (he'c covered adequately for now,
   new urine pending), also with diarrhea (c. dif neg)
   2. Fever
   Etiology appears most likely secondary to pneumonia (legionella),
   urinary tract infection given occasional bacteria and WBCs on UA.
   Unfortunately antibiotics given prior to urine culture being sent.
   - coverage as above (broad for now).
   - follow up cultures (as above)
   - cooling blanket (goal temp < 101 oral)
   2a. Sepsis:  goal UOP greater .5 cc/kg/hr, CVP goal of 14-16, MAP > 60,
   follow lactate and mixed venous sat. Will obtain central access.
   3. Fluid Status
    - decreasing blood pressures likely [**2-20**] insensible losses from fever
   and work of breathing.
   - Will bolus with LR to goal CVP 14-16 for now (high PEEP likely
   decreasing pre load)
   4. Elevated CK: could be a viral etiology, but with rising Cr concern
   for rhabdomyolysis (large blood). Follow serial CKs. Will hydrate to
   goal UOP as above. Spin urine for analysis
   5. HIV:  Hold HAART therapy in the setting of acute (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 415**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress and required significant ventilator support. The patient tested positive for urine legionella and has been experiencing fever, elevated WBC count, bandemia, and respiratory acidosis. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring adjustments in ventilation settings and continuous monitoring. The patient also has an elevated CK level, which may indicate rhabdomyolysis, and his fluid status is being closely monitored due to concerns about insensible losses from fever and work of breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum cultures is necessary.
2. Legionella infection: The patient tested positive for urine legionella. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the infection and prevent complications.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The elevated CK level suggests the possibility of rhabdomyolysis. Close monitoring of CK levels and ensuring adequate hydration are crucial to prevent further muscle damage.
4. Fluid status instability: The patient's fluid balance needs to be closely monitored due to concerns about insensible losses from fever and work of breathing. Adjustments in fluid administration may be required to maintain appropriate CVP levels.
5. Hypotension: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and previous PCP pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress and required significant ventilator support. The patient tested positive for Legionella in his urine and has been experiencing fever, bandemia, and elevated WBC count. He is intubated and on ARDS strategy, with goals of adjusting ventilator settings based on ABG results. The patient's current condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress is likely due to an infectious etiology, possibly a superimposed infection on underlying COPD. The ventilator settings need to be adjusted according to ARDSnet goals, taking into consideration the patient's response to oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Legionella Pneumonia: The positive urine Legionella suggests that the patient may have Legionella pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be continued, and follow-up cultures should be obtained.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, bandemia, elevated WBC count, and positive urine culture indicate a possible sepsis. Goal UOP, CVP, and MAP should be maintained, and central access should be obtained. Lactate and mixed venous saturation levels should be monitored closely.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:
   50 yo male with history of HIV/AIDS and PCP pneumonia was admitted from
   the ED with hypoxic respiratory distress now with ARDs picture
   requiring significant vent support found to have positive urine
   legionella.  Has continued to require very high levels of Vent support.
   PLAN:
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Etiology of patient's hypoxic
   respiratory distress likely infectious in etiology given elevated WBC,
   bandemia, and fever. Now with pos urine legionella.,PCP remains
   unlikely since CD4 count is adequate.   Additional contributions
   includes infection resulting in COPD exacerbation given scattered
   wheezes throughout. Now intubated with ARDS strategy
   - Vent goals: Adjusting to ARDSNEt goals, for fio O2 of 80 PEEP should
   be 14. for peep of 14, Fio2 should be 70. Goal Vt is 480 (by height).
   Currently with resp acidosis (likely [**2-20**] fever with increased work of
   breathin will allow for some degree of permissive hypercapnia). Will
   follow ABG carefully. [**Month (only) 51**] use esophageal balloon to guide PEEP, likely
   will benefit from PEEP greater than ARDSnet suggests. Esophageal
   balloon placed [**4-25**] AM (pressures have been variable, with TPP of 15
   range). We may need to paralyze to optimze vent function and consider
   alternative strategy (APRV etc). I am also concerned about him being
   volume down and creating more zone 1 lung zone (first we will try to
   get CVP > 16 and see if there are any effects on his oxygenation)
   - DFA and Respiratory antigen panel (neg) stopped tamiflu.
   - f/u sputum gram stain and culture: Looks like gram stain + or GPC in
   pairs and clusters, Clx pending (legionella Pos in urine)
   - Continue Cefepime, Vanco and Levoflox until neg sputum clx (may be a
   super infection present)
   - standing nebulizer treatment. Hold on steroids for PCP or COPD flare
   for now.
   - Other sources: urine appears dirty (he'c covered adequately for now,
   new urine pending), also with diarrhea (c. dif neg)
   2. Fever
   Etiology appears most likely secondary to pneumonia (legionella),
   urinary tract infection given occasional bacteria and WBCs on UA.
   Unfortunately antibiotics given prior to urine culture being sent.
   - coverage as above (broad for now).
   - follow up cultures (as above)
   - cooling blanket (goal temp < 101 oral)
   2a. Sepsis:  goal UOP greater .5 cc/kg/hr, CVP goal of 14-16, MAP > 60,
   follow lactate and mixed venous sat. Will obtain central access.
   3. Fluid Status
    - decreasing blood pressures likely [**2-20**] insensible losses from fever
   and work of breathing.
   - Will bolus with LR to goal CVP 14-16 for now (high PEEP likely
   decreasing pre load)
   4. Elevated CK: could be a viral etiology, but with rising Cr concern
   for rhabdomyolysis (large blood). Follow serial CKs. Will hydrate to
   goal UOP as above. Spin urine for analysis
   5. HIV:  Hold HAART therapy in the setting of acute (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 415**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and previous PCP pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory distress and is now on significant ventilator support. The patient has tested positive for urine legionella and continues to require very high levels of vent support. His current condition includes fever, elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The plan is to adjust ventilation goals based on ARDSnet guidelines, place an esophageal balloon to guide PEEP, and consider alternative ventilation strategies such as APRV. The patient is also at risk for volume depletion and zone 1 lung injury. Antibiotics have been started for suspected pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Fluid status is being closely monitored due to insensible losses from fever and work of breathing. The patient's HIV therapy has been held in the setting of acute illness. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)
3. Barotrauma
4. Volutrauma
5. Infectious complications due to immunocompromised status
6. Rhabdomyolysis
7. Acute kidney injury (AKI)
8. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding

A trial of nitric oxide was unsuccessful in improving oxygen saturation. The patient was placed in the prone position and showed improvement after suctioning moderate amount of secretions.

The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. Allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has received multiple antibiotics including azithromycin, ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, levofloxacin, and cefepime.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0°F, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 99/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 20 mmHg, bladder pressure of 14 mmHg, and total fluid intake of 6,314 mL with an output of 687 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, vecuronium, heparin sodium, famotidine, and dextrose 50%.

   Respiratory Status: Legionella Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] improvement in O2 once placed in the prone position; will continue
   with current management at this time
   - will do another trial of vecuronium since patient continues to have
   dysynchrony with the ventilator
   - goal PaO2 >55; currently patient meeting goal.  monitor with ABG
   - will continue therapy with vancomycin, cefipime, levofloxacin to
   cover for legionella and broadly for nosocomial; though may consider
   stopping vanco given no GPC; will also add azithro x 5 days to double
   cover for legionella since patient having a difficult time with O2
   saturations.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   Sepsis
   -  likely source is legionella
   - cont abx coverage
   - goal UOP >50 cc/hr- meeting goal
   - monitor BP/HR- stable
   Elevated CK- continues to trend down
   - LR 500 cc x 1
   Creatinine slightly elevated- continue monitoring; ensure adequate
   hydration while monitoring creatinine
   [**Name (NI) 441**] unclear etiology; ddx includes ITP, TTP, DIC,
   sequestration, drugs, HIT
   - unlikely HIT given timeframe; may be medication induced; will need to
   consider further targeting down therapy to decrease number of abx.
   Famotidine may also be cause; will need to continue to monitor plt
   count for now
   - no evidence for TTP for now- cont to monitor
   - DIC labs sent- FDP elevated, but fibrinogen also elevated

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now ARDS caused by Legionella. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications.

1. Respiratory Status: The patient has been diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia, which is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia. His respiratory status is being monitored closely, and he is receiving appropriate treatment.

2. Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI): The patient's condition has worsened despite high ventilator settings, leading to VILI. The medical team has tried different strategies such as prone positioning, nitric oxide, and changing sedation medication (vecuronium) to improve oxygen saturation.

3. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis, which is an overwhelming immune response to an infection. The source of infection is suspected to be Legionella. Antibiotic coverage has been adjusted accordingly.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which could be due to several factors including ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenia), TTP (Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura), DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation), sequestration, or medication-induced causes. The medical team is monitoring the platelet count and considering further evaluation and treatment options.

5. Renal Function: The patient's creatinine levels are"

- The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV and a history of PCP pneumonia. He is now presenting with Legionella pneumonia.
- The patient has a fever of 104.8 degrees Fahrenheit and is experiencing hypoxia, requiring prone positioning to improve oxygenation.
- The patient has been sedated with propofol and paralyzed with vecuronium.
- He is receiving multiple antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Cefepime.
- The patient's vital signs show a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 89 to 104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, bladder pressure of 14 mmHg, and fluid balance with an intake of 4,064 mL and output of 1,405 mL.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of PCV+Assist, with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 40 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 34 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%, and arterial blood gas (ABG) results showing pH of 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 48 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 124 mmHg.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hct) level of 33.6 g/dL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated D-dimer levels.
- The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, indicated by hypoxia and the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, which may require further interventions such as tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and positive blood cultures suggest a systemic infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

3. Pneumonia-related complications: Legionella pneumonia can cause severe lung damage, leading to complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, or necrotizing pneumonia.

4. HIV-related complications: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV increases the risk of opportunistic infections and related complications, such as Pneum"

The patient has no known drug allergies. He received antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Cefepime. The patient is currently on vecuronium infusion, midazolam, fentanyl, and other ICU medications such as dextrose, heparin sodium, and famotidine.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 40.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 74 to 130 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 89 to 162 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 14 to 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and the central venous pressure is 12 mmHg. The bladder pressure is 14 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows a total inflow of 4,064 mL and outflow of 1,405 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,659 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes ventilation mode PCV+Assist, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 16 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%, and plateau pressure of 34 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.27, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 48 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 124 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is deferred.

Physical examination findings include coarse mechanical breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly, regular rapid heart rate with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and the patient is sedated and paralyzed. The laboratory results show leukocyte count of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, blood glucose of 96 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.8 mEq/L, and lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L. Other lab results include elevated D-dimer level of 7,462 ng/mL, elevated troponin-T level, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Imaging studies show pulmonary infiltrates consistent with Legionella pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is critically ill with Legionella pneumonia and requires continued ICU care. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate). The patient's family has been informed of the situation and the plan of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, potential medical complications may include worsening respiratory distress, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and sepsis."

   significantly worsen to low 80s when supine.
   - will continue therapy with vancomycin, cefipime, levofloxacin to
   cover for legionella and broadly for nosocomial; though may consider
   stopping vanco given no GPC; also on azithro x 5 days to double cover
   for legionella since patient having a difficult time with O2
   saturations.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   Hyperthermia
   -          cooling blanket placed yesterday, standing acetaminophen
   given with improvement in temp (below 100).
   -          Likely source is infectious- legionella known to cause temps
   >40C.
   -          Unlikely medication- no real reports of vecuronium induced
   hyperthermia- possible [**2-20**] propofol, though now propofol  has been

   sequestration, drugs, HIT
   - unlikely HIT given timeframe; may be medication induced; will need to
   consider further targeting down therapy to decrease number of abx.
   Famotidine may also be cause; will need to continue to monitor plt
   count for now
   - no evidence for TTP for now- cont to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU with severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and abnormal coagulation parameters. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, positive cultures for Legionella, and leukocytosis, there is a high suspicion of sepsis. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be continued, and the patient's vital signs and laboratory parameters should be closely monitored.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level has significantly increased from 1.2 to 2.0, indicating acute kidney injury. Further evaluation of the etiology, such as urine analysis and further imaging studies, should be done. Fluid management and close monitoring of renal function are crucial.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation parameters, including elevated D-dimer and low fibrinogen levels, suggest a possible coagulopathy. DIC should be ruled out, and appropriate treatment should be initiated if necessary.
4. Hyperthermia: Despite receiving acetaminophen and antibiotics, the patient continues to have a high temperature. Infectious causes should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, currently admitted with ARDS and a positive Legionella test. The patient's respiratory status improved when placed in the prone position. The patient has been experiencing fever, and there are concerns about nosocomial infections, including Legionella. The patient is on multiple antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level. There are concerns about possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or acute kidney injury. The patient's condition is considered severe, and there is a discussion about the potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or other advanced therapies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has an elevated leukocytosis and bandemia, suggesting an ongoing infection. Legionella pneumonia is suspected as the source of sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired renal function. The cause of acute kidney injury is unclear but may be due to hypotension or another underlying condition.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has an elevated D-dimer level and low fibr"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] [**Month/Day (2) **] c/b DIC
   1. Respiratory Status: [**Month/Day (2) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] tolerated supine position overnight; will continue keeping in supine
   position while monitoring saturations.  O2 sat monitor not as accurate
   as ABG given DIC in extremities
   - given improvement, stop cisatracurium and switch from pentobarbital
   to midazolam/fentanyl to see if patient tolerates
   - consider placing in prone position prior to re-paralysis if patient
   oxygenation worsens off paralysis.  Would prefer prone over
   re-paralysis if possible
   - goal PaO2 >55; currently patient meeting goal.
   - respiratory acidosis improved with changed vent settings; cont to
   monitor and adjust as necessary
   - will continue therapy with vancomycin, cefipime, levofloxacin to
   cover for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**] and broadly for nosocomial; will cont vanco for
   now since patient
s clinical status very tenuous; also on azithro x 5
   days to double cover for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**] since patient having a difficult
   time with O2 saturations.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   2. DIC
   - likely [**2-20**] sepsis
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen slightly improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - d/w heme onc.  f/u their recs.  Appreciate input
   3. Hyperthermia
   - likely source is infectious- likely [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; though cannot rule
   out super infection or other source of infection
   - resend sputum; pan culture if spikes
   -   still with cooling blanket in place, but off.  Would prefer
   acetaminophen but may need to restart cooling blanket if temp >103.5
   4. Sepsis
   -  likely source is [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; pan culture if spikes.  Con
t to look
   for sources
   - cont broad abx coverage with levo, cefipime, vanco, and azithro
   - goal UOP >50 cc/hr- monitor closely
   - monitor BP/HR- slighly hypotensive; will need to evaluate for fluid
   boluses.  Goal MAP>65
   - on xigris therapy for DIC and two organ system failure- will complete
   full 96 hr course
   5. Acute Kidney Injury- creat 2.9 today
   -  unclear etiology; though likely ATN secondary to hypotension; urine
   lytes c/w pre-renal (FENA 0.3%) though unclear if this is secondary to
   hypovolemia vs poor forward flow
   - will give LR 500 cc x 1 and monitor cardiac indexes with Vigileo
   monitor
   - renally dose medications.  Look at urine sediment
   6. [**Name (NI) 477**] unclear etiology; ddx sepsis, hypovolemia (pre-renal),
   cardiogenic
   - ECHO today to evaluate cardiac function
   - will monitor UOP, creatinine elevated.  Plan to give LR bolus and
   monitor Cardiac index
   - may consider pressors if MAP<60; but may consider decreasing PEEP to
   see if process is decreased preload/ worsening output secondary to
   elevated increaing intrathoracic pressures
   - will do non-invasic cardiac monitoring
   - repeat bladder pressure

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, currently experiencing ARDS and DIC. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement with the supine position, so it will be continued. The goal is to maintain oxygen saturation above 95% and PaO2 >55. The patient's respiratory acidosis has improved with adjusted vent settings.

The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin to cover for potential hospital-acquired infections, as well as azithromycin for 5 days to double-cover for [Name Initial (PRE) 476] due to the patient's difficulty with oxygen saturations.

The patient's fever continues to spike despite antibiotics, so acetaminophen will be continued. Nebulized bronchodilators will also be continued. Sputum cultures will be repeated.

The patient's DIC is likely secondary to sepsis. Fibrinogen levels have slightly improved. Activated protein C therapy will be continued, and transfusions will be given if Hct <25, fibrinogen <100, and platelets <35. Hematology consultation is recommended.

The patient's hyperthermia is likely due to an infectious source, possibly [Month/Day (2) 476], but other sources cannot be ruled out. Sputum cultures and pan culture will be repeated.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] [**Month/Day (2) **] c/b DIC
   1. Respiratory Status: [**Month/Day (2) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] tolerated supine position overnight; will continue keeping in supine
   position while monitoring saturations.  O2 sat monitor not as accurate
   as ABG given DIC in extremities
   - given improvement, stop cisatracurium and switch from pentobarbital
   to midazolam/fentanyl to see if patient tolerates
   - consider placing in prone position prior to re-paralysis if patient
   oxygenation worsens off paralysis.  Would prefer prone over
   re-paralysis if possible
   - goal PaO2 >55; currently patient meeting goal.
   - respiratory acidosis improved with changed vent settings; cont to
   monitor and adjust as necessary
   - will continue therapy with vancomycin, cefipime, levofloxacin to
   cover for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**] and broadly for nosocomial; will cont vanco for
   now since patient
s clinical status very tenuous; also on azithro x 5
   days to double cover for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**] since patient having a difficult
   time with O2 saturations.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   2. DIC
   - likely [**2-20**] sepsis
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen slightly improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - d/w heme onc.  f/u their recs.  Appreciate input
   3. Hyperthermia
   - likely source is infectious- likely [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; though cannot rule
   out super infection or other source of infection
   - resend sputum; pan culture if spikes
   -   still with cooling blanket in place, but off.  Would prefer
   acetaminophen but may need to restart cooling blanket if temp >103.5
   4. Sepsis
   -  likely source is [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; pan culture if spikes.  Con
t to look
   for sources
   - cont broad abx coverage with levo, cefipime, vanco, and azithro
   - goal UOP >50 cc/hr- monitor closely
   - monitor BP/HR- slighly hypotensive; will need to evaluate for fluid
   boluses.  Goal MAP>65
   - on xigris therapy for DIC and two organ system failure- will complete
   full 96 hr course
   5. Acute Kidney Injury- creat 2.9 today
   -  unclear etiology; though likely ATN secondary to hypotension; urine
   lytes c/w pre-renal (FENA 0.3%) though unclear if this is secondary to
   hypovolemia vs poor forward flow
   - will give LR 500 cc x 1 and monitor cardiac indexes with Vigileo
   monitor
   - renally dose medications.  Look at urine sediment
   6. [**Name (NI) 477**] unclear etiology; ddx sepsis, hypovolemia (pre-renal),
   cardiogenic
   - ECHO today to evaluate cardiac function
   - will monitor UOP, creatinine elevated.  Plan to give LR bolus and
   monitor Cardiac index
   - may consider pressors if MAP<60; but may consider decreasing PEEP to
   see if process is decreased preload/ worsening output secondary to
   elevated increaing intrathoracic pressures
   - will do non-invasic cardiac monitoring
   - repeat bladder pressure

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV and a history of PCP pneumonia, now diagnosed with ARDS and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues, including respiratory distress, fever, hypotension, renal impairment, and possible sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with prone positioning, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, activated protein C therapy, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient's respiratory status remains positive for ARDS, with ongoing hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. Continued monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent further lung injury.

2. DIC: The patient is showing signs of DIC, characterized by low fibrinogen levels, elevated D-dimer, and thrombocytopenia. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential, along with appropriate transfusion therapy as needed.

3. Hyperthermia: The patient continues to have persistent fever spikes despite antibiotic therapy, suggesting a possible source of infection. Resending sputum cultures and considering pan-culture if necessary would help identify the causative agent.

4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to [Month/Day (2) 476], and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be continued. Monitoring for sources of infection and performing appropriate cultures are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV, history of PCP pneumonia, now ARDS with associated DIC. The patient's respiratory status has improved with the use of prone positioning and decreased FiO2. However, the patient still requires mechanical ventilation and sedation. There is evidence of acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 2.9. The patient also has hyperthermia, sepsis, and an unclear etiology for his condition, with possible causes including sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock. The patient's HIV status is being monitored, and HAART therapy is currently held. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to ARDS. Potential complications include further deterioration in oxygenation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory acidosis.
2. Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine level indicates acute kidney injury (AKI). The underlying cause needs to be identified and managed promptly to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
3. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a need for ongoing surveillance and management to prevent complications such as organ dysfunction and septic shock.
4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, which can lead to bleeding and thrombotic complications if not managed appropriately.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] Legionella c/b DIC
   1. Respiratory Status: Legionella Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] tolerated supine position overnight; will continue keeping in supine
   position while monitoring saturations.  O2 sat monitor not as accurate
   as ABG given DIC in extremities
   - given improvement, stop cisatracurium and switch from pentobarbital
   to midazolam/fentanyl to see if patient tolerates
   - consider placing in prone position prior to re-paralysis if patient
   oxygenation worsens off paralysis.  Would prefer prone over
   re-paralysis if possible
   - goal PaO2 >55; currently patient meeting goal.
   - respiratory acidosis improved with changed vent settings; cont to
   monitor and adjust as necessary
   - will continue therapy with vancomycin, cefipime, levofloxacin to
   cover for legionella and broadly for nosocomial; will cont vanco for
   now since patient
s clinical status very tenuous; also on azithro x 5
   days to double cover for legionella since patient having a difficult
   time with O2 saturations.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   2. DIC
   - likely [**2-20**] sepsis
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen slightly improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - d/w heme onc.  f/u their recs.  Appreciate input
   3. Hyperthermia
   - likely source is infectious- likely legionella; though cannot rule
   out super infection or other source of infection
   - resend sputum; pan culture if spikes
   -   still with cooling blanket in place, but off.  Would prefer
   acetaminophen but may need to restart cooling blanket if temp >103.5
   4. Sepsis
   -  likely source is legionella; pan culture if spikes.  Con
t to look
   for sources
   - cont broad abx coverage with levo, cefipime, vanco, and azithro
   - goal UOP >50 cc/hr- monitor closely
   - monitor BP/HR- slighly hypotensive; will need to evaluate for fluid
   boluses.  Goal MAP>65
   - on xigris therapy for DIC and two organ system failure- will complete
   full 96 hr course
   5. Acute Kidney Injury- creat 2.9 today
   -  unclear etiology; though likely ATN secondary to hypotension; urine
   lytes c/w pre-renal (FENA 0.3%) though unclear if this is secondary to
   hypovolemia vs poor forward flow
   - will give LR 500 cc x 1 and monitor cardiac indexes with Vigileo
   monitor
   - renally dose medications.  Look at urine sediment
   6. [**Name (NI) 477**] unclear etiology; ddx sepsis, hypovolemia (pre-renal),
   cardiogenic
   - ECHO today to evaluate cardiac function
   - will monitor UOP, creatinine elevated.  Plan to give LR bolus and
   monitor Cardiac index
   - may consider pressors if MAP<60; but may consider decreasing PEEP to
   see if process is decreased preload/ worsening output secondary to
   elevated increaing intrathoracic pressures
   - will do non-invasic cardiac monitoring
   - repeat bladder pressure
   7. HIV- hold HAART for now; low VL and high CD4

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now ARDS due to Legionella pneumonia complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been febrile. He is showing signs of acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine levels. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated C-reactive protein level, and elevated D-dimer level. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics for Legionella and coverage for nosocomial infections, activated protein C, and other supportive therapies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient has ARDS and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a need to monitor oxygenation levels and adjust ventilator settings accordingly. Prone positioning may be considered if the patient's oxygenation worsens.
2. DIC: The patient has evidence of DIC, which can lead to bleeding and clotting abnormalities. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management with blood products and anticoagulants is necessary.
3. Hyperthermia: The patient's fever needs to be"

   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] [**Month/Day (2) **] c/b DIC
    1. Respiratory Status: [**Month/Day (2) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continues to improve with decreased FiO2 requiring without requiring
   prone positioning.  Paralysis stopped yesterday, but continued to be on
   pentobarbital
   - will cont to wean vent settings as tolerated; con
t with
   pentobarbital for now before switching to midaz/fentanyl to prevent
   dysynchrony and try to wean as much as possible
   - goal PaO2 >65; currently patient meeting goal.
   - respiratory acidosis improved with changed vent settings; cont to
   monitor and adjust as necessary
   - will continue therapy with vancomycin, cefipime, levofloxacin to
   cover for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**] and broadly for nosocomial; will cont vanco for
   now since patient
s clinical status very tenuous; also on azithro x 5
   days to double cover for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**] since patient having a difficult
   time with O2 saturations.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   2. DIC
   - likely [**2-20**] sepsis
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen slightly improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - d/w heme onc.  f/u their recs.  Appreciate input
   3. Hyperthermia
   - likely source is infectious- likely [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; though cannot rule
   out super infection or other source of infection
   - resend sputum; pan culture if spikes
   -   still with cooling blanket in place, but off.  Would prefer
   acetaminophen but may need to restart cooling blanket if temp >103.5
   4. Sepsis
   -  likely source is [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; pan culture if spikes.  Con
t to look
   for sources
   - cont broad abx coverage with levo, cefipime, vanco, and azithro
   - goal UOP >50 cc/hr- monitor closely
   - monitor BP/HR- slighly hypotensive; will need to evaluate for fluid
   boluses.  Goal MAP>65
   - on xigris therapy for DIC and two organ system failure- will complete
   full 96 hr course
   5. Acute Kidney Injury- creat 2.9 today
   -  unclear etiology; though likely ATN secondary to hypotension; urine
   lytes c/w pre-renal (FENA 0.3%) though unclear if this is secondary to
   hypovolemia vs poor forward flow
   - will give LR 500 cc x 1 and monitor cardiac indexes with Vigileo
   monitor
   - renally dose medications.  Look at urine sediment
   6. [**Name (NI) 477**] unclear etiology; ddx sepsis, hypovolemia (pre-renal),
   cardiogenic
   - ECHO today to evaluate cardiac function
   - will monitor UOP, creatinine elevated.  Plan to give LR bolus and
   monitor Cardiac index
   - may consider pressors if MAP<60; but may consider decreasing PEEP to
   see if process is decreased preload/ worsening output secondary to
   elevated increaing intrathoracic pressures
   - will do non-invasic cardiac monitoring
   - repeat bladder pressure

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP). He is currently in the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition has been improving, with decreased FiO2 requirements and improved oxygenation after discontinuing cisatracurium. He is still sedated and paralyzed, but these measures are being weaned off as tolerated. The patient continues to have fever spikes despite antibiotic therapy and requires further investigation. His renal function is compromised, and there is a possibility of acute kidney injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient is improving but still requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. DIC: The patient has signs of DIC, which can lead to bleeding complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Hyperthermia: The patient continues to have fever spikes, indicating a possible ongoing infection or superinfection.
4. Sepsis: The patient is likely septic, and the source of infection needs to be identified and treated promptly.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, which may require renal replacement therapy if it worsens.
6. Cardiac Function: The patient's cardiac function is being evaluated due to possible cardiogenic causes"

    1. Respiratory Status: [**Month/Day (2) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continues to improve with decreased FiO2 without requiring prone
   positioning.  Paralysis stopped yesterday, but continued to be on
   pentobarbital
   - will cont to wean vent settings as tolerated; con
t with
   pentobarbital for now before switching to midaz/fentanyl to prevent
   dysynchrony and try to wean as much as possible
   - goal PaO2 >65; currently patient meeting goal.
   - now has metabolic acidosis combined with a respiratory acidosis,
   likely in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] complicated by high temperatures.  Treat
   hyperthermia with cooling blanket and tylenol; adjust pressure to
   increase TV/MV to improve respiratory acidosis.
   - will continue therapy cefipime, levofloxacin to cover for [**Last Name (un) 476**]
   and broadly for nosocomial; will continue azithromycin for double
   coverage.  Will stop vancomycin since there is no source to suggest
   MRSA at this time.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   2. DIC
   - likely [**2-20**] sepsis
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - d/w heme onc.  Offical consult placed.  No need for anticoagulation
   at this time
   3. Hyperthermia
   - likely source is infectious- likely [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; though cannot rule
   out super infection or other source of infection
   - resend sputum; pan culture if spikes
   -   still with cooling blanket in place, but off.  Would prefer
   acetaminophen but may need to restart cooling blanket if temp >103.5
   - other possibilites include drug fever, DVT
   - BLE LENIs today; check CBC with diff for eosinophilia
   - Consult ID for further causes
   - tachycardic likely [**2-20**] hyperthermia.  Improving when temp decreases
   4. Sepsis
   -  likely source is [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; pan culture if spikes.  Con
t to look
   for sources
   - cont broad abx coverage with levo, cefipime, and azithro
   - goal UOP >50 cc/hr- monitor closely
   - monitor BP/HR- Goal MAP>65
   - on xigris therapy for DIC and two organ system failure- will complete
   full 96 hr course
   - will consult ID for any other cause of his fever.  Leukocytosis
   slightly worse today.  Con
t to spike fevers
   5. Acute Kidney Injury- creat 3.8 today
   -  urine sediment with granular casts c/w ATN.  Likely in the setting
   of sepsis
   - improved BP/Cardiac index on lasix gtt- possibly poor forward cardiac
   flow causing poor renal perfusion.  Fluid bolus did not improve
   hemodynamics significantly.
   - cont to monitor.  No acute cause for HD at this time.  K stable
   - will renally dose medications.  Monitor Ca/Phos product.  No need for
   phos binders at this time
   - monitor creatinine.  Should improve with time, but may need HD if
   indicated.  Currently, good UOP with lasix gtt, though could likely
   just be from post ATN diuresis.
   6. Hypotension- resolving.
   - possibly cardiac in origin since it improved with diuresis- ?
   subendocardial ischmia given TWI.  Though no significant bump in
   cardiac enzymes
   - ECHO shows depressed RV and LV function.  Could be secondary to
   septic heart or volume overload.  Cardiac index improved with diuresis
   7. HIV- hold HAART for now; low VL and high CD4

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV and a history of PCP pneumonia, now presenting with ARDS and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient continues to improve with decreased FiO2, but requires ongoing respiratory support. Paralysis was stopped yesterday, and the patient remains on pentobarbital. The goal is to wean vent settings as tolerated and switch to midazolam/fentanyl to prevent dysynchrony.

The patient has metabolic acidosis combined with respiratory acidosis, likely due to high temperatures. Treatment for hyperthermia includes a cooling blanket and Tylenol, while adjusting pressure to increase TV/MV and improve respiratory acidosis. Antibiotic therapy includes cefipime, levofloxacin, and azithromycin to cover for potential infections.

The patient's DIC is likely secondary to sepsis. Monitoring of labs is essential, and fibrinogen has improved. Activated protein C therapy is ongoing, and transfusion parameters should be followed if Hct < 25, cryo for fibrinogen < 100, and plts if < 35. No need for anticoagulation at this time.

Hyperthermia may be due to an infectious source, possibly [**Month/Day (2) 476**], or a super infection. Resend sputum and pan culture if spikes are necessary. Other possibilities include drug fever or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A leukocyte"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] [**Month/Day (2) **] c/b DIC
    1. Respiratory Status: [**Month/Day (2) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continues to improve with decreased FiO2 without requiring prone
   positioning.  Paralysis stopped yesterday, but continued to be on
   pentobarbital
   - will cont to wean vent settings as tolerated; con
t with
   pentobarbital for now before switching to midaz/fentanyl to prevent
   dysynchrony and try to wean as much as possible
   - goal PaO2 >65; currently patient meeting goal.
   - now has metabolic acidosis combined with a respiratory acidosis,
   likely in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] complicated by high temperatures.  Treat
   hyperthermia with cooling blanket and tylenol; adjust pressure to
   increase TV/MV to improve respiratory acidosis.
   - will continue therapy cefipime, levofloxacin to cover for [**Last Name (un) 476**]
   and broadly for nosocomial;
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   2. DIC
   - likely [**2-20**] sepsis
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen slightly improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - d/w heme onc.  f/u their recs.  Appreciate input
   3. Hyperthermia
   - likely source is infectious- likely [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; though cannot rule
   out super infection or other source of infection
   - resend sputum; pan culture if spikes
   -   still with cooling blanket in place, but off.  Would prefer
   acetaminophen but may need to restart cooling blanket if temp >103.5
   4. Sepsis
   -  likely source is [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; pan culture if spikes.  Con
t to look
   for sources
   - cont broad abx coverage with levo, cefipime, vanco, and azithro
   - goal UOP >50 cc/hr- monitor closely
   - monitor BP/HR- slighly hypotensive; will need to evaluate for fluid
   boluses.  Goal MAP>65
   - on xigris therapy for DIC and two organ system failure- will complete
   full 96 hr course
   5. Acute Kidney Injury- creat 2.9 today
   -  unclear etiology; though likely ATN secondary to hypotension; urine
   lytes c/w pre-renal (FENA 0.3%) though unclear if this is secondary to
   hypovolemia vs poor forward flow
   - will give LR 500 cc x 1 and monitor cardiac indexes with Vigileo
   monitor
   - renally dose medications.  Look at urine sediment
   6. [**Name (NI) 477**] unclear etiology; ddx sepsis, hypovolemia (pre-renal),
   cardiogenic
   - ECHO today to evaluate cardiac function
   - will monitor UOP, creatinine elevated.  Plan to give LR bolus and
   monitor Cardiac index
   - may consider pressors if MAP<60; but may consider decreasing PEEP to
   see if process is decreased preload/ worsening output secondary to
   elevated increaing intrathoracic pressures
   - will do non-invasic cardiac monitoring
   - repeat bladder pressure
   7. HIV- hold HAART for now; low VL and high CD4

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, now presenting with ARDS and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is sedated, paralyzed, and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 decreased from 90% to 60% as oxygenation continues to improve. The patient's temperature is elevated, and there is evidence of acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 2.9. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, DIC, hyperthermia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to further respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis could worsen if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly.
3. DIC: The patient's DIC poses a risk for bleeding and clotting complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates acute kidney injury, which may progress to renal failure if not addressed.
5. Hyperthermia: The patient's persistent fever may indicate an ongoing infection or superinfection, which needs to be controlled to prevent further complications.
6. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV status may predispose him to opportunistic infections or other HIV-related complications.
7. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) increases the risk of organ"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] [**Month/Day (2) **] c/b DIC
     1. Respiratory Status: [**Month/Day (2) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continues to improve with decreased FiO2- still on pentobarbital.
   Plan to continue for now while improving vent settings and attempting
   to wean
   - will cont to wean vent settings as tolerated; con
t with
   pentobarbital for now before switching to midaz/fentanyl to prevent
   dysynchrony and try to wean as much as possible
   - goal PaO2 >65; currently patient meeting goal.
   - respiratory acidosis improving with decreased temperature.  Also
   increased pressure to 24 yesterday with improvement in TV.  This AM
   still slightly acidemic with high PCO2 so decreased PEEP to 20 to see
   if that will improve TV rather than further adjusting pressure or
   rate.  FiO2 at 65% with good pO2.
   - will continue therapy cefipime, levofloxacin to cover for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**]
   and broadly for nosocomial; will continue azithromycin for double
   coverage.  Off vancomycin
   - awaiting ID recs
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   2. Sepsis/DIC
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C- tomorrow is last day
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - No need for anticoagulation at this time.  Had IVC filter placed
   yesterday
   - hypotension improved.  Maintaining MAPs>60
   -cont to panculture as needed for high temps
   3. Hyperthermia
   - likely source is infectious- likely [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**]; though cannot rule
   out super infection or other source of infection
   - resend sputum; pan culture if spikes
   -   found to have DVT yesterday in R popliteal/superficial femoral.
   Also could be cause of fevers.  Improving with around the clock tylenol
   - f/u ID recs
   - tachycardia improved with decreased temps
   4. Acute Kidney Injury- creat 3.8 today -  urine sediment with granular
   casts c/w ATN.  Likely in the setting of sepsis
   - plan to stop lasix gtt today for hypernatremia.  Free Water Deficit
   5.5 L
   - cont to monitor.  No acute cause for HD at this time.  K stable
   - will renally dose medications.
   - start calcium carbonate for calcium/phos product >50
   5. Hypernatremia- likely in the setting of diuresis and had been NPO
   - free water flushes 250 cc Q4H
   - stop lasix gtt
   - recheck lytes this PM.  If improved, may reconsider restarting lasix
   gtt
   6. Hypotension- resolving.
   - possibly cardiac in origin since it improved with diuresis- ?
   subendocardial ischmia given TWI.  Though no significant bump in
   cardiac enzymes
   - ECHO shows depressed RV and LV function.  Could be secondary to
   septic heart or volume overload.  Cardiac index improved with diuresis
   - hold diuresis for now per above
   7. HIV- hold HAART for now; low VL and high CD4

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now ARDS. The patient has experienced several medical complications including DIC, DVT in the right lower extremity, and an IVC filter placement. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including pentobarbital for sedation, furosemide for fluid management, and drotrecogin for sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 103.7°F, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/71 mmHg to 137/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on FiO2 of 65%. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on 04/29/2106 at 03:28 PM and 04:58 PM.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated troponin T, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient also has an elevated lactate level and decreased albumin level. The patient's kidney function is impaired with a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL and urine sediment showing granular casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis.

The patient's plan includes continuing weaning of ventilator settings, maintaining PaO2 >65, and adjusting pressures and rates accordingly. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] [**Month/Day (2) **] c/b DIC
    1. Respiratory Status: [**Month/Day (2) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continues to improve with decreased FiO2 without requiring prone
   positioning.  Paralysis stopped yesterday, but continued to be on
   pentobarbital
   - will cont to wean vent settings as tolerated; con
t with
   pentobarbital for now before switching to midaz/fentanyl to prevent
   dysynchrony and try to wean as much as possible
   - goal PaO2 >65; currently patient meeting goal.
   - now has metabolic acidosis combined with a respiratory acidosis,
   likely in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] complicated by high temperatures.  Treat
   hyperthermia with cooling blanket and tylenol; adjust pressure to
   increase TV/MV to improve respiratory acidosis.
   - will continue therapy cefipime, levofloxacin to cover for [**Last Name (un) 476**]
   and broadly for nosocomial; will continue azithromycin for double
   coverage.  Will stop vancomycin since there is no source to suggest
   MRSA at this time.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   2. DIC
   - likely [**2-20**] sepsis
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - d/w heme onc.  Offical consult placed.  No need for anticoagulation
   at this time
   3. Hyperthermia
   - likely source is infectious- likely [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; though cannot rule
   out super infection or other source of infection
   - resend sputum; pan culture if spikes
   -   still with cooling blanket in place, but off.  Would prefer
   acetaminophen but may need to restart cooling blanket if temp >103.5
   - other possibilites include drug fever, DVT
   - BLE LENIs today; check CBC with diff for eosinophilia
   - Consult ID for further causes
   - tachycardic likely [**2-20**] hyperthermia.  Improving when temp decreases
   4. Sepsis
   -  likely source is [**Month/Day (2) 476**]; pan culture if spikes.  Con
t to look
   for sources
   - cont broad abx coverage with levo, cefipime, and azithro
   - goal UOP >50 cc/hr- monitor closely
   - monitor BP/HR- Goal MAP>65
   - on xigris therapy for DIC and two organ system failure- will complete
   full 96 hr course
   - will consult ID for any other cause of his fever.  Leukocytosis
   slightly worse today.  Con
t to spike fevers
   5. Acute Kidney Injury- creat 3.8 today
   -  urine sediment with granular casts c/w ATN.  Likely in the setting
   of sepsis
   - improved BP/Cardiac index on lasix gtt- possibly poor forward cardiac
   flow causing poor renal perfusion.  Fluid bolus did not improve
   hemodynamics significantly.
   - cont to monitor.  No acute cause for HD at this time.  K stable
   - will renally dose medications.  Monitor Ca/Phos product.  No need for
   phos binders at this time
   - monitor creatinine.  Should improve with time, but may need HD if
   indicated.  Currently, good UOP with lasix gtt, though could likely
   just be from post ATN diuresis.
   6. Hypotension- resolving.
   - possibly cardiac in origin since it improved with diuresis- ?
   subendocardial ischmia given TWI.  Though no significant bump in
   cardiac enzymes
   - ECHO shows depressed RV and LV function.  Could be secondary to
   septic heart or volume overload.  Cardiac index improved with diuresis
   7. HIV- hold HAART for now; low VL and high CD4

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now diagnosed with ARDS. The patient also has DIC and a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower extremity after placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient's respiratory status has improved with decreased FiO2 and is currently meeting the goal of maintaining a PaO2 above 65. The patient is still experiencing hyperthermia, which may be due to an infectious source, such as pneumonia, or another cause. The patient's metabolic acidosis combined with respiratory acidosis is being treated with cooling blankets and acetaminophen. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued to cover for both hospital-acquired and community-acquired pathogens. The patient's DIC is being monitored, and no anticoagulation is currently needed. The patient's acute kidney injury is likely secondary to sepsis, and renal dosing of medications has been implemented. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and an echocardiogram showed depressed right and left ventricular function, which could be due to septic heart or volume overload. The patient's HIV status is being managed with a hold on HAART therapy due to low viral load and high CD4 count. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is fever. The patient has been experiencing hypercarbic/acidotic episodes on reduced PEEP/driving pressure, but has shown improvement with increased FiO2. The patient's arterial line was replaced, and a consultation with the Infectious Disease team was obtained. Various cultures were sent off, including sputum, BAL fluid, urine, and stool. The patient also had a CT torso to evaluate for cavitary pneumonia and drainable focus, as well as a CT sinus for extrapulmonary involvement. Additionally, a mini-BAL for PJP, GS, bacterial/viral/fungal culture, and CBC with diff was performed. The patient's labs showed unchanged DIC labs, with a slight decrease in sodium levels from 153 to 152. The patient received several medications including pentobarbital, famotidine, and dextrose. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. The flow sheet data indicates ongoing fluid administration and output, along with respiratory support through mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate, stable blood pressure, and decreased respiratory rate. The patient's ABG results are within acceptable ranges. Physical examination findings are mostly not assessed. The patient has abnormal lab results, including elevated WBC count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] [**Month/Day (2) **] c/b DIC
     #. Respiratory Status: [**Month/Day (2) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Respiratory status continued to improve over the past 24 hours, with
   decreasing Fi02 requirement and resolution of hypercarbia and acidosis
   at same pressure settings, however this am appeared to acutely become
   hypoxic with decreasing TV.  Most likely positional atelectasis vs
   mucous plugging/airway obstruction (RT appreciated partial occlusive ?
   mucous in ETT)
   -Increase Fi02, attempt to suction ETT, pt unlikely to tolerate bronch
   or ETT switch. Will manage conservitavely for now. No weaning down of
   driving pressures/PEEP for now.
   - will cont to wean vent settings as tolerated; con
t with
   pentobarbital for now before switching to midaz/fentanyl to prevent
   dysynchrony and try to wean as much as possible
   - goal PaO2 >65; currently patient meeting goal.
   - Appreciate ID input, pt currently on levaquin for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**], per
   their recs have d/c
d vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin.
   - Had mini BAL yesterday, gram stain unremarkable, continue to follow
   up results.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   #Elevated pancreatic enzymes. Markedly elevated from prior (normal
   [**4-25**]).  Unclear precipitant for pancreatitis. Has not been on propofol
   for some time.  Given pt has HIV, is at risk for extrapulmonary
   manifestations of legionellosis, ? unknown if this has been known to
   affect pancreas.
   -literature search for current meds, risk for pancreatitis (xigris,
   pentobarbital)
   -Monitor hemodynamics, aggressive fluid rescusitation if needed for
   third spacing, caution for now given respiratory status.
   -Continue trophic feeds via NGT, do not advance for now.
   -Continue to monitor Ca, HCT, hemodynamics.
   -Necrotizing pancreatitis may be etiology for fevers, pt currently not
   stable enough for CT, but should consider when possible. Discuss with
   ID need to start meropenem.
   -continue to trenf enzymes
   2. ?DIC.  DIC frequently described sequelae of legionellosis.  Pt has
   had abnormalities in his DIC panel as well as a confusing picture of
   symmetric distal extremity ischemia,  more consistent in appearance
   with vasoocclusion related to pressors (which pt has not received)
   rather than DIC/microangiopathic thrombosis.  The magnitide of the
   digital ischemia is out of proportion to the degree of abnormality of
   DIC. Also on ddx is croglobulinema, pt has HIV which has not been
   associated with increased incidence of DIC, unlike HCV. No known
   history of HCV, last serology here [**2101**].
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C, will have completed today at 1700
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - No need for anticoagulation at this time.  Had IVC filter placed
   yesterday for DVT
   - continue to monitor exam, call vascular surgery if pt develops
   evidence for wet gangrene that could be fuelling sepsis.
   -f/u cryoglobulins (send yesterday, a send out, should take ~10 days)
   -check HCV serology
   3. Hyperthermia. Pt
s fever curve as decreased slightly, however tmax
   still >103F.
   - likely source is infectious- [**Year (4 digits) 476**] known to cause prolonged high
   fevers and course is known to be more severe in HIV positive patients
   however fevers are of impressive duration and severity.  Warrants probe
   for alternative sources of which he has many:
   - ID consulted, appreciate their input. Rec imaging sinuses and torso
   with CT (look for cavitary lesions in lungs, sinuses to look for
   extrapulmonary [**Year (4 digits) 476**], abd to look for other abscess, necrotizing
   pancreatitis).
   - continue levaquin for PNA
   -  found to have DVT in R popliteal/superficial femoral.  s/p IVC
   filter
   - ATC tylenol
   - cooling blankets PRN
   4. Acute Kidney Injury- urine sediment with casts c/w ATN, low SG c/w
   poor concentrating ability.  Cr down slightly to 3.5, persistently
   uremic. No hyperkalemia, still making urine, no indication for dialysis
   at present.
   - cont to monitor.
   - will renally dose medications.
   - started calcium carbonate for calcium/phos product >50 with good
   response.
   5. Hypernatremia- likely in the setting of diuresis and had been NPO
   - Free h20 deficit ~5L, did not respond to free h20 flushes, may not be
   absorbing adequately from GI tract.  Will give D5W, recheck lytes in pm
   and adjust free water repletion accordingly.
   - stopped lasix gtt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV, a history of PCP pneumonia, and now ARDS. The patient is experiencing multiple medical complications, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute kidney injury, hyperthermia, and hypernatremia.

The patient's respiratory status has improved over the past 24 hours, but there was an acute episode of hypoxia with decreased tidal volume. The likely cause could be mucous plugging or airway obstruction. FiO2 has been increased, and efforts to suction the endotracheal tube were made.

The patient's elevated pancreatic enzymes suggest the possibility of pancreatitis, but the cause is unclear. Monitoring hemodynamics and aggressive fluid resuscitation are recommended. The patient's HIV status puts him at risk for extrapulmonary manifestations of Legionellosis.

The patient has abnormalities in his DIC panel, and there is a suspicion of microangiopathic thrombosis. However, the ischemia in the distal extremities is disproportionate to the degree of DIC. Other potential causes include cryoglobulinemia and crohn's disease. The patient has an IVC filter placed due to DVT.

The patient's fever curve has decreased slightly, but the temperature is still above 103°F. It is likely that an infectious source is causing the hyperthermia, possibly Pneumocystis pneumonia or another infection. CT imaging is recommended to investigate further.

The patient also has acute kidney injury with casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis. Renal dosing of medications is necessary. The patient's sodium levels are high, likely due to diuresis and being NPO. Free water deficit needs to be corrected.

The patient's HIV status should be monitored, but HAART should be held for now due to low viral load and high CD4 count.

ICU care includes repletion with fiber, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a DNR code status and requires continued ICU level of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] [**Month/Day (2) **] c/b DIC
     1. Respiratory Status: [**Month/Day (2) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continues to improve with decreased FiO2- still on pentobarbital.
   Plan to continue for now while improving vent settings and attempting
   to wean
   - will cont to wean vent settings as tolerated; con
t with
   pentobarbital for now before switching to midaz/fentanyl to prevent
   dysynchrony and try to wean as much as possible
   - goal PaO2 >65; currently patient meeting goal.
   - respiratory acidosis improving with decreased temperature.  Also
   increased pressure to 24 yesterday with improvement in TV.  This AM
   still slightly acidemic with high PCO2 so decreased PEEP to 20 to see
   if that will improve TV rather than further adjusting pressure or
   rate.  FiO2 at 65% with good pO2.
   - will continue therapy cefipime, levofloxacin to cover for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**]
   and broadly for nosocomial; will continue azithromycin for double
   coverage.  Off vancomycin
   - awaiting ID recs
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - resend sputum given temperature
   2. Sepsis/DIC
   - cont to monitor labs; fibrinogen improved this AM
   - cont activated protein C- tomorrow is last day
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - No need for anticoagulation at this time.  Had IVC filter placed
   yesterday
   - hypotension improved.  Maintaining MAPs>60
   -cont to panculture as needed for high temps
   3. Hyperthermia
   - likely source is infectious- likely [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**]; though cannot rule
   out super infection or other source of infection
   - resend sputum; pan culture if spikes
   -   found to have DVT yesterday in R popliteal/superficial femoral.
   Also could be cause of fevers.  Improving with around the clock tylenol
   - f/u ID recs
   - tachycardia improved with decreased temps
   4. Acute Kidney Injury- creat 3.8 today -  urine sediment with granular
   casts c/w ATN.  Likely in the setting of sepsis
   - plan to stop lasix gtt today for hypernatremia.  Free Water Deficit
   5.5 L
   - cont to monitor.  No acute cause for HD at this time.  K stable
   - will renally dose medications.
   - start calcium carbonate for calcium/phos product >50
   5. Hypernatremia- likely in the setting of diuresis and had been NPO
   - free water flushes 250 cc Q4H
   - stop lasix gtt
   - recheck lytes this PM.  If improved, may reconsider restarting lasix
   gtt
   6. Hypotension- resolving.
   - possibly cardiac in origin since it improved with diuresis- ?
   subendocardial ischmia given TWI.  Though no significant bump in
   cardiac enzymes
   - ECHO shows depressed RV and LV function.  Could be secondary to
   septic heart or volume overload.  Cardiac index improved with diuresis
   - hold diuresis for now per above
   7. HIV- hold HAART for now; low VL and high CD4

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV and a history of PCP pneumonia, now presenting with ARDS. He has developed DIC, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower extremity, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation with pentobarbital. His respiratory status is improving, but he remains hypercarbic and acidotic. He is febrile with a temperature of 103.6°F. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated D-dimer levels indicating ongoing inflammation and possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). His kidney function is impaired with acute kidney injury (AKI), and he has hypernatremia. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he is being monitored closely for any changes in his condition. The patient has a history of HIV and is currently on HAART, but it has been held due to low viral load and high CD4 count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS is improving, but he remains on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if ventilator settings are not adjusted appropriately.
2. Sepsis/DIC: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and elevated D-dimer levels suggest ongoing infection and possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV and a history of PCP pneumonia, now presenting with ARDS and DIC. He has developed a DVT in his right lower extremity and had an IVC filter placed. The patient's respiratory status continues to improve, and he is off pentobarbital. Vent settings are being weaned as tolerated. The patient's fever is still present despite antibiotics, and there is ongoing monitoring for infectious causes. Laboratory results show improvement in some parameters but persistent abnormalities such as elevated D-dimer levels and renal impairment. The patient's hyperthermia may be due to an ongoing infection. Other issues include hypernatremia, hypotension, and potential acute kidney injury. The patient's HIV status is being managed with caution due to the current critical condition. The patient's code status remains DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yr old man with HIV ARDS [**Year (4 digits) **] DIC ARF
   1. Resp Failure: ARDS in setting of [**Year (4 digits) **], was doing well
   overnight but this AM has dropped tidal volumes significantly.
   Etiology- question cuff leak, plugging, volume - Check STAT CXR,
   increase FIO2 to 60%. Check cuff pressure.
   2. Increased Pancreatic Enzymes: etiology - medication related,
   ischemia, will trend and try for ABD CT later today. Contimue trophic
   tube feeds and will need to consukt nutrition and add TPN to meet
   calorie needs
   3. Fevers: pan cultured, concern is for extrapulmonary sources of
   infection
 will try to bring down to CT when stable.
   4. DIC: questionable versus low flow state to explain limb ischemia,
   trend labs
   5. ARF: ATN with casts, holding Lasix gtts with [**Last Name (LF) 492**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need to
   readdress if UOP trends down
   6. Hypernatremia: did not respond to free water flushes, changed to IV

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old man with a complex medical history including HIV, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation), and ARF (Acute Kidney Injury). He is currently sedated and unresponsive in the ICU.

The patient's recent events include the placement of an arterial line, sputum culture, BAL (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) culture, urine culture, and stool culture. He has had episodes of low blood sugar, fevers, and his condition has been fluctuating.

The patient's vital signs show elevated body temperature, slightly elevated blood pressure, and decreased respiratory rate. His oxygen saturation is 92% on ventilator support with a FiO2 of 40%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his hemodynamic parameters indicate a cardiac output of 6 L/min and a cardiac index of 2.7 L/min/m2.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and various other abnormalities in electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal an abnormal chest X-ray, and a mini BAL shows no microorganisms.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues: respiratory failure due to ARDS, increased pancreatic enzymes, fevers, DIC, acute kidney injury, and hypernatremia. The plan involves further evaluation and management of these conditions, including adjusting"

   50 yr old man with HIV ARDS [**Year (4 digits) **] DIC ARF and
   1. Resp Failure: ARDS in setting of [**Year (4 digits) **], was doing well
   overnight but this AM has dropped toidal volumes significantly.
   Etiology- question cuff leak, plugging, volume - Check STAT CXR,
   increase FIO2 to 60%. Check cuff pressure.
   2. Increased Pancreatic Enzymes: etiology - medication related,
   ischemia, will trend and try for ABD CT later today. Contimue trophic
   tube feeds
   3. Fevers: pan cultured, concern is for extrapulmonary sources of
   infection
   4. DIC: questionable versus low flow state to explain limb ischemia

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old man with a complex medical history including HIV, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), and ARF (acute renal failure). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU (intensive care unit) and is sedated, unable to provide any history.

The patient's condition has been fluctuating throughout the day. He experienced an episode of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) last night and continues to have persistent fevers. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and attempts to wean PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) were unsuccessful. However, there was some improvement in oxygenation as FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) was able to be weaned.

The patient has multiple lines and tubes inserted, including an arterial line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube. He is receiving several medications, including antibiotics (cefipime and azithromycin), sedatives (pentobarbital), and supportive care medications (famotidine and dextrose).

The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in various parameters, such as elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies, including a torso CT scan and sinus CT scan, have been recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now ARDS. The patient has developed DIC, pancreatitis, and is experiencing hyperthermia. The patient's respiratory status is positive for PCP but negative for improvement. The patient has an elevated pancreatic enzyme level, which is markedly higher than the previous measurement. There are concerns about necrotizing pancreatitis, and imaging studies have been recommended to evaluate the situation further. The patient also has an acute kidney injury with casts consistent with ATN, but the creatinine level is improving. The patient has hypernatremia and hyperkalemia, for which appropriate measures are being taken. The patient's HIV status shows a low viral load and high CD4 count, so HAART is being held for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is positive for PCP but has not improved. Continued weaning attempts with FiO2 decreased to 50% and PEEP 22 should be monitored closely. Decreasing FiO2 to 40% with PEEP 20 may be considered if the patient continues to tolerate the weaning attempt.
2. Pancreatitis: The elevated pancreatic enzymes indicate pancreatitis. Imaging studies, such as a CT scan, are recommended to assess the extent of the condition and rule out necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitoring of hemodynamics, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and cautious feeding are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV, history of PCP pneumonia, and now ARDS. He has developed DIC, pancreatitis, DVT, hyperthermia, acute kidney injury, and hypernatremia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is receiving multiple medications including pentobarbital, versed/fentanyl, levofloxacin, cefepime, and acetaminophen. His lab results show abnormalities in coagulation parameters, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function. The patient's fever persists despite antibiotics, and there is a concern for infectious sources such as [Year (4 digits) 476]. Imaging studies have been recommended to investigate further. The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient's respiratory status continues to improve but is still positive for ARDS. There are concerns about positional atelectasis, mucous plugging, and airway obstruction. The patient is currently being managed conservatively with increased FiO2 and suctioning of the endotracheal tube.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes, indicating possible pancreatitis. The cause is unclear, and there is a concern for extrapulmonary manifestations of Legionellosis. Monitoring hemodynamics, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and avoiding advance feeds are recommended. A literature search for current medications and their risk for pancreatitis is advised.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia who is now experiencing ARDS. The patient's current medical conditions include fever, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, pancreatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and DVT. The patient has been diagnosed with DIC, likely secondary to sepsis, and is also experiencing symptoms of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but there is still concern for positional atelectasis or mucous plugging. The patient's fever is uncontrolled despite antibiotics, and there are concerns about infectious causes such as Legionellosis. The patient's kidney function is impaired, and there are indications of acute tubular necrosis. The patient also has hypernatremia, which may be due to diuresis and poor oral intake. Lastly, the patient's HIV status is being monitored, and HAART therapy is being withheld for now due to the patient's low viral load and high CD4 count.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory distress, development of organ failure (particularly renal), further deterioration of the patient's nutritional status, progression of pancreatitis with potential necrosis, and increased risk of thromboembolic events."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, currently admitted to the ICU with ARDS. He is critically ill and requires full ventilatory support. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F (39°C), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 144/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 280 insp/min, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's medical history includes DIC, ARF, persistent fevers, limb ischemia, and hypernatremia. The patient's current treatment includes pentobarbital infusion, midazolam, famotidine, and various other medications. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, D-dimer, and lactate levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and albumin levels. The patient's chest X-ray reveals stable bilateral interstitial infiltrates. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is currently receiving ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS puts him at risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Adjustments to ventilator settings may be necessary to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Increased Pancreatic Enzymes: The patient's elevated pancreatic enzyme levels may indicate pancreatitis or another pancreatic disorder. Further investigation and consultation with gastroenterology may be required.
3. Persistent Fevers: Despite negative cultures, the patient continues to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, now presenting with ARDS. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. Over the past 24 hours, the patient's respiratory status has continued to improve, with a decrease in FiO2 requirement and resolution of hypercarbia and acidosis at the same pressure settings. However, this morning the patient appeared to acutely become hypoxic with decreasing tidal volume. It is likely that this was due to positional atelectasis or mucous plugging/airway obstruction. The patient has partial occlusive mucus in the endotracheal tube. To manage this, the FiO2 was increased, and attempts were made to suction the ETT. The patient is unlikely to tolerate a bronchoscopic or ETT switch. Conservative management will be continued for now, and there will be no weaning down of driving pressures/PEEP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Regular surveillance cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered to prevent and treat any potential infections.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be considered to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, currently admitted with ARDS. The patient is intubated and sedated, with fair air movement in the chest and no wheezes. Vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. The patient has a high respiratory rate due to mechanical ventilation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows normal CO and CI, with a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure. The ventilator settings will need to be carefully managed to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Increased Pancreatic Enzymes: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes, possibly due to medication-related ischemia or other causes. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed.
3. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which could indicate an ongoing infection or extrapulmonary source of infection. Investigation and appropriate treatment are necessary.
4. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient has laboratory findings suggestive of DIC, which can cause widespread clotting and bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is required.
5. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient has acute kidney injury with casts in the urine, possibly due to ATN (Acute Tubular"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and currently presenting with ARDS. He also has pancreatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hyperthermia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support and has been experiencing fever spikes despite receiving antibiotics.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are as follows:

1. Respiratory Status: The patient has ARDS and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of the ventilator.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatic enzymes are markedly elevated, indicating acute pancreatitis. Complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocysts, or infected pancreatic necrosis may develop.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, which is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting. Complications can include bleeding and organ damage.

4. Hyperthermia: The patient continues to have high fevers despite antibiotic treatment. This could indicate an ongoing infectious process or another source of fever that needs to be identified and managed.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has signs of AKI, with casts in the urine suggestive of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and current ARDS. He also has DIC and pancreatitis. The patient's respiratory status is positive for PCP-negative ARDS. The patient's temperature is 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure is 109/58 mmHg, heart rate is 85 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 0, respiratory rate set at 28 breaths per minute, PEEP at 18 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PIP) at 41 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 248. Physical examination reveals scleral edema, foamy secretions at the mouth, coarse mechanical breath sounds bilaterally, and dusky appearing digits on both upper and lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated D-dimer, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient has markedly elevated pancreatic enzymes, and there is suspicion of necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient also has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and the INR is improving. The patient is hyperthermic"

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, now presenting with ARDS and DIC. He continues to have spikes in fever despite antibiotics. The patient has pancreatitis with markedly elevated pancreatic enzymes. Mini-BAL results are pending, and he is currently on levaquin for pneumonia. The patient also has a DVT and an IVC filter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Status: The patient is ARDS positive, and there is a concern about the possibility of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). There is also a need to consider changing the endotracheal tube (ETT) due to prolonged intubation.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes, indicating ongoing pancreatitis. The cause of pancreatitis is unclear, and there is a concern for necrotizing pancreatitis as the etiology for persistent fevers.

3. Hyperthermia: The patient continues to spike fevers despite antibiotic treatment, suggesting an alternative source of infection. Imaging studies have been recommended to evaluate potential sources of infection, such as sinusitis and cavitary lesions in the lungs.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has AKI with urine sediment showing casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Creatinine levels are improving, but there is a concern for further deterioration after contrast load during future CT scans.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV and a history of PCP pneumonia, currently experiencing ARDS and pancreatitis. The patient's temperature continues to spike despite antibiotics, and there are moderate-sized pleural effusions present. The patient has also been diagnosed with DVT and an IVC filter has been placed. Other medical complications include hyperthermia, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and HIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient's respiratory acidosis needs to be managed by decreasing temperature rather than making changes to driving pressure or RR.
2. Hypotension: Sepsis, poor cardiac output, and intravascular volume depletion are possible causes for the patient's hypotension. Fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
3. Pancreatitis: The cause of pancreatitis is unclear, but medication-induced pancreatitis or hypotension could be potential factors. Monitoring enzyme levels and nutrition is essential.
4. DIC: The patient has signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and appropriate management, including transfusions, needs to be continued.
5. Hyperthermia: The patient continues to have high fevers, likely due to an infectious source. Alternative sources of infection need to be investigated, and the patient requires further evaluation, such as thoracentesis or a CT head.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, now presenting with ARDS and DIC. The patient continues to experience fever spikes despite antibiotic treatment, and imaging shows increased mucosal thickening of the sinuses but no evidence of abdominal abscess, pancreatic necrosis, or hemorrhage.

The patient's respiratory status remains positive for PCP, but overnight it was negative. The patient's TVS were decreased to 0, thought to be possibly due to the endotracheal tube rather than a primary pulmonary process. The patient's current ventilator settings include FiO2 at 50% and PEEP at 14 cmH2O. The goal PaO2 is greater than 65, which the patient is meeting.

The patient's lab results show elevated pancreatic enzymes, markedly elevated from prior levels. The cause of pancreatitis is unclear. The patient's coagulation parameters show an improving INR, and the patient is being monitored for any signs of wet gangrene that could be fueling sepsis.

The patient has a history of DVT and has had an IVC filter placed. Heparin was started but stopped due to concern for bleeding. The patient's kidney injury is improving, and the urine sediment with casts is consistent with acute tubular necrosis. The patient's hypernatremia is being managed with free water flushes and half-normal saline boluses.

The patient's HIV status is being closely monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, now presenting with ARDS, DIC, and pancreatitis. He is experiencing high fevers, hypotension, respiratory acidosis, and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including respiratory status, hypotension, elevated pancreatic enzymes, DIC, hyperthermia, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and HIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient has ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, or intravascular volume depletion. Immediate intervention is required to stabilize his blood pressure and prevent further complications.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated pancreatic enzymes indicate ongoing inflammation of the pancreas. It is unclear what the precipitant for pancreatitis is. Monitoring of the enzymes and appropriate management is necessary to prevent complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.
4. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient has signs of DIC, a condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. This can lead to both excessive bleeding and clotting. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management is required.
5. Hyperthermia: The patient continues to have high fe"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] [**Month/Day (2) **] c/b DIC, [**Last Name (un) **],
   and pancreatitis
     #. Respiratory Status: [**Last Name (un) **] Positive.  PCP negative
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] PEEP decreased to 14, FiO2 5o%.  With dysynchrony, patient become
   more acidemic; but with sedation, acidemia improving.
   - Will try to switch to AC today with FiO2 50%, PEEP 14, and TV around
   550 (which is what he
s doing now) to see if patient has less
   dysynchrony.  If ABG looks good, will then try to wean off
   pentobarbital and switch back to midaz/fentanyl.
   - goal PaO2 >65; currently patient meeting goal.
   - Appreciate ID input, pt currently on levaquin for [**Name Initial (PRE) 476**].  Will
   need to 2 more days
   - Mini-BAL results- NGTD.  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**].
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - has moderate sized R>L pleural effusion.  Will ask IP to evaluate
   since patient is supine with difficult ventilation and difficult to
   visualize with ultrasound
   #. Hypotension: ddx includes sepsis, poor cardiac output, intravascular
   volume depletion [**2-20**] high fevers- improving now
   -  good UOP makes volume depletion less likely; last C.I. on vigileo
   was >3.
   -  cont vanco/cefipime for broad spectrum coverage for possible
   sepsis.  WBC maintaining despite high temperatures.
   #.  DIC.
   - INR now improving.
   - APC stopped on [**2106-5-1**]
   - transfusion parameters- if Hct<25, cryo for fibrinogen <100, plts if
   less than 35 though may worsen coagulopathy.
   - No need for anticoagulation at this time.  Had IVC filter placed for
   DVT.  Had blood in the ETT after starting heparin gtt for DVT; will
   hold for now and cont to monitor HCT
   - continue to monitor exam.  Appreciate vascular surgery- will likely
   need amputation in the future, but not at this time. Will continue to
   follow.
   -cryoglobulins and HCV- negative
   #. Hyperthermia. Continues to spike despite abx.
   - likely source is infectious vs central- [**Date Range 476**] known to cause
   prolonged high fevers and course is known to be more severe in HIV
   positive patients however fevers are of impressive duration and
   severity.  warrants probe for alternative sources of which he has many
    - ID consulted, appreciate their input. CT sinus/torso without
   evidence of source of infection.  Though patient does have pleural
   effusion so need to consider thoracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] need IP to do [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   - continue levaquin for PNA.  on vanco/cefipime for broad spectrum
   coverage.  Pan culture
   -  found to have DVT in R popliteal/superficial femoral.  s/p IVC
   filter
   - may need to consider CT head to look for central source; also to eval
   for herniation.  [**Month (only) 51**] need for LP for meningitis but first would need CT
   head.  Will hold off today while adjust [**Month (only) 494**] settings.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   something to do this PM or tomorrow if patient tolerates AC and ABG is
   good
   - central line re-sited.  Culture of tip pending.  Possible source for
   fever.  [**Month (only) 51**] also consider TEE to eval for endocarditis though TTE
   without evidence of valvular disease and blood cultures negative
   - sent fungal cultures; not covering for fungal though unlikely.
   - ATC tylenol
   - cooling blankets PRN
   #. Acute Kidney Injury- urine sediment with casts c/w ATN.  Cr
   improving. No hyperkalemia, still making urine, no indication for
   dialysis at present.
   - cont to monitor.  Esp post CT scan
   - will renally dose medications.
   #. Hypernatremia-
   -  Free H2O deficit improving; cont free H2O flushes 350 cc/4H.  may
   need to decrease if sodium continues to decline
   #Elevated pancreatic enzymes- improving now.
   - no inciting factor noted at this time. CT without evidence of
   pancreatitis.  Likely medication induced; or possibly [**2-20**] hypotension

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, ARDS, and pancreatitis. He is currently experiencing hypotension, fever, and has a positive blood culture for MRSA. The patient's respiratory status is stable on assisted ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 14. There is a moderate-sized right-to-left pleural effusion. The patient has DIC with improving INR, and APC has been stopped. He also has hyperthermia, likely due to an infectious cause, and continues to spike fevers despite antibiotic treatment. The patient has acute kidney injury with improving creatinine levels and no indication for dialysis. He has hypernatremia and elevated pancreatic enzymes, which are improving now. The patient is on full tube feeds at 75 mL/hour.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation, indicating respiratory failure or severe respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient has persistent high fevers and positive blood cultures, suggesting a possible infection leading to sepsis.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, which can lead to bleeding or clotting complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has signs of AKI, characterized by abnormal urine sediment and elevated creatinine levels.
5. Hypernatremia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, ARDS, and pancreatitis. He is currently experiencing DIC, fever, hypotension, elevated pancreatic enzymes, respiratory acidosis, and hyperthermia. The patient's respiratory status is stable with a positive PCP test but negative results for other pathogens. He has moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion. The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, or intravascular volume depletion. His elevated pancreatic enzymes suggest medication-induced pancreatitis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 at 50% and PEEP at 14, which will be decreased as tolerated. His temperature continues to spike despite antibiotics. The patient also has elevated D-dimer levels, indicating possible disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He has a history of DVT and an IVC filter has been placed. The patient's kidney function is compromised, but there is no indication for dialysis at present. He is hypernatremic and receiving IV fluids. The patient's HIV status is being monitored, and HAART therapy is temporarily withheld. The patient is receiving TPN with lipids and replete with fiber.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis indicates inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain oxygenation and prevent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and current ARDS caused by DIC and pancreatitis. The patient is experiencing fever, respiratory distress, hypotension, and has a pleural effusion. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, D-dimer levels, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal no evidence of infection or valvular disease. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and cultures are pending. The patient has a deep vein thrombosis and has undergone placement of an inferior vena cava filter. The patient's condition remains unstable, and the medical team is closely monitoring his progress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but it is important to wait for culture results before making any definitive conclusions.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to worsening respiratory failure if oxygenation and ventilation parameters are not carefully managed.
3. Pleural Effusion: The moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion needs further evaluation, possibly through thoracentesis, to rule out any underlying infection or other causes.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in the right popliteal/superficial femoral vein and has undergone placement of an inferior vena cava"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, ARDS, DIC, and pancreatitis. He is currently experiencing fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple organ dysfunctions including respiratory, renal, and metabolic abnormalities. He has been on various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and analgesics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern due to ARDS. He may continue to experience difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation, leading to further lung damage or respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The presence of high fevers, leukocytosis, and positive cultures indicate a possible infection, which could progress to sepsis and septic shock.
3. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient has evidence of DIC, as indicated by abnormal coagulation parameters. This condition can lead to bleeding or clotting complications throughout the body.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and urine sediment with casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). AKI can worsen if not managed appropriately.
5. Hyperthermia: The patient's persistent high fever despite antibiotic therapy suggests an alternative source of infection that needs to be identified and treated promptly.
6. Hypernatremia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and recent ARDS. He is currently experiencing multiple medical complications including DIC, pancreatitis, sepsis, DVT, and acute kidney injury. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has had several interventions to manage his condition. His vital signs are unstable with persistent fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal coagulation profile. Imaging studies reveal a moderate-sized pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient has ARDS, which is a known complication of severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST mode, and the ventilator settings need to be adjusted carefully to maintain oxygenation and ventilation while minimizing barotrauma and volutrauma.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, or intravascular volume depletion. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient is being monitored closely for any signs of improvement or deterioration.

3. DIC: The patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as indicated by the elevated D-dimer levels, prolonged PT/INR, and low fibrinogen. The patient is being treated with cryop"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and current ARDS caused by DIC and pancreatitis.
- The patient has been experiencing fever spikes despite receiving antibiotics.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved with decreased PEEP and FiO2 levels on the ventilator.
- A mini-BAL was performed, which showed no growth of PCP.
- The patient has a moderate-sized right lower lobe pleural effusion.
- Hyperthermia continues, and the source of infection is still unclear. The patient is being treated with levaquin for pneumonia and vancomycin/cefepime for broad-spectrum coverage.
- The patient has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right popliteal/superficial femoral vein and has been placed on an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.
- Central line re-siting was done due to suspicion of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and cultures are pending.
- Fungal cultures were sent, but coverage is not provided for fungal infections.
- The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis, poor cardiac output, or intravascular volume depletion.
- The patient's coagulation profile shows improvement in INR.
- Anticoagulation is being held due to blood in the endotracheal tube after starting heparin.
- The patient's acute kidney injury"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now presenting with ARDS caused by DIC and pancreatitis. The patient's fever has been persistent despite antibiotics, and there is a moderate-sized right lower pleural effusion. The patient's respiratory status is positive for PCP negative, with a decreased PEEP and FiO2. The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, or intravascular volume depletion. DIC is present with improving INR and transfusion parameters. Hyperthermia continues despite antibiotics, with a potential central source of infection. Acute kidney injury is present with casts consistent with ATN, but the patient is improving and not in need of dialysis. Hypernatremia is being addressed with free water flushes. Elevated pancreatic enzymes are improving, possibly medication-induced. HIV management is on hold due to low viral load and high CD4 count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has ARDS and ongoing respiratory distress. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient has persistent fever despite antibiotics, suggesting an ongoing infectious process. This could lead to sepsis, which may worsen the patient's condition.

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a moderate-sized right lower pleural effusion"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and current conditions including DIC, pancreatitis, DVT, and persistent high fevers of unclear etiology.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/56 mmHg to 146/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient has several medical complications including:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient is positive for PCP pneumonia, but it is currently negative. The ID team's recommendation is to continue levaquin for pneumonia, and the goal is to wean the vent to PEEP of 12 and decrease FiO2 as tolerated.
2. Hyperthermia: The patient continues to have high fevers despite antibiotics. A likely source of infection could be central, especially considering the patient's known condition causing prolonged high fevers and severe course, especially in HIV positive patients. The ID"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia. He currently presents with multiple medical complications, including DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), pancreatitis, DVT (deep vein thrombosis), and persistent high fevers of unclear etiology. The patient is currently sedated, mechanically ventilated, and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent high fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is positive for PCP pneumonia, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation with increased PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to his underlying lung disease.
3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, poor cardiac output, or intravascular volume depletion. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is necessary.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and urine sediment with casts indicate acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely secondary to hypoperfusion or nephrotoxic drugs. Renal function should be closely monitored, and dose adjustments of medications will be required.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated serum sodium level"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and current conditions including DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), pancreatitis, DVT (deep vein thrombosis), and persistent high fevers of unclear etiology. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a decreased PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) of 12 cmH2O. His vital signs show a fever of 102.6°F, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/56 mmHg to 146/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (PaO2) of 176 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals scleral edema, tachycardia, distant heart sounds, coarse mechanical breath sounds bilaterally, slightly distended abdomen with normal bowel sounds, and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema with dusky appearing digits. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low albumin, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal liver function tests"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and current conditions including DIC, pancreatitis, DVT, and persistent high fevers of unclear etiology. The patient's respiratory status is positive for PCP-negative and PEEP decreased to 12 with FiO2 at 50%. The patient has been on levaquin for PCP, but the results of the mini-BAL were negative for PCP. The patient continues to have high fevers despite antibiotics, and a thoracentesis is planned due to a moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion.

The patient also has hyperthermia, hypotension, DIC, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. The patient's HIV status is being monitored, with HAART held for now due to low viral load and high CD4 count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's high fevers, hypotension, and positive blood cultures suggest a potential infectious cause for his symptoms. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection remains unclear.

2. Endocarditis: The patient's persistent fever, along with the presence of a central line and a recent DVT, raise the possibility of endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be considered to evaluate for this condition.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):"

   The patient is rotated, and the lung volumes are very low; however,
   there is
   no new airspace consolidation. Unchanged is a right pleural effusion,
   moderate to large, bibasilar atelectasis, and a focal opacity in the
   periphery
   of the right upper lobe. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
   IMPRESSION: Little interval change in widespread pulmonary opacities,
   likely
   due to a combination of bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis, and
   superimposed right lower lobe pneumonia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, now presenting with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pancreatitis, and possible drug reaction. The patient's respiratory status is positive for PCP-negative, with decreased PEEP and FiO2 set at 12 and 50% respectively. The goal is to maintain a PaO2 greater than 65.

The patient has been experiencing hyperthermia, with continued spikes in temperature despite antibiotics. Antibiotics have been stopped, and the source of infection is still pending. The patient also has a moderate-sized right lower pleural effusion.

The patient has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right popliteal/superficial femoral vein and has undergone an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. Central line re-siting has been performed, and cultures are pending. Fungal cultures are also being monitored.

The patient's hypotension is improving now, with good urine output. All antibiotics have been discontinued, and I/Os are being closely monitored.

The patient is also diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) with urine sediment showing casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Creatinine levels are stable, and there are no signs of hyperkalemia or indication for dialysis at present.

Additionally, the patient has hypernatremia, likely due"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, who was admitted to the ICU with DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), pancreatitis, and suspected PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 107/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode, set tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and spontaneous tidal volume of 233 mL.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile, and evidence of kidney injury. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and there are no signs of infection on the chest X-ray. The patient has a moderate-sized right lower lobe pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis. There is also a focal opacity in the periphery of the right upper lobe.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including hyperthermia, hypotension, DIC, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and supportive care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU for an unknown reason. They have been receiving various medications, including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Cefepime. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. They are also receiving intravenous infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation, respectively.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (100.9 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate ranging from 77 to 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103 to 122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 5,085 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 1,581 mL given through the peripheral route and 3,220 mL given through the intravenous route. The patient has also received a total of 3,430 mL of blood products.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 294 K/uL, low platelet count (Plt) of 285"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pancreatitis, and hypoxemic respiratory failure following a positive pneumonia. The patient's condition has been improving slowly but is still on PRVC ventilation with high driving pressures. He has developed a right-sided pneumothorax, possibly due to barotrauma from the high pressures, and surgery to place a chest tube has been scheduled. The patient also has a pleural effusion, which will be drained and sent for culture. His antibiotics have been discontinued, but there is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Blood cultures are pending. The patient's fever has improved, and his white blood cell count is trending down. His labs show elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate levels, and low albumin. Imaging shows widespread pulmonary opacities involving the left lung and a large right-sided pneumothorax. The patient's goals include PaO2 >65, continued acetaminophen for fever, and continued nebulized bronchodilators. He is also being closely monitored for hypotension, DIC, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. His HIV treatment has been held, but his viral load remains low, and CD4 count is high.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several acute conditions. They have severe respiratory failure, digit ischemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation. They are receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, heparin, and others. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated respiratory rate. They are on mechanical ventilation with a high pressure inspiratory pressure (PIP) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient has a history of pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. They also have renal failure, hypernatremia, and evidence of acute lung injury. Imaging and microbiology tests are pending. The patient has been placed on DNR (do not resuscitate) status and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI)
5. Septic shock
6. Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with HIV who was admitted with pneumonia and sepsis. He has severe respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, digit ischemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's condition is complicated by liver function abnormalities, acute kidney injury (ARF), and hypernatremia. He also has a new pleural effusion and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. The patient's prognosis is poor, with a do not resuscitate (DNR) status and critical illness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have significant ventilator requirements, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This can lead to further lung complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. DIC: The patient has been diagnosed with DIC, which is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. It can lead to bleeding and organ damage.
3. ARF: The patient has acute kidney injury, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed. This can result in further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremia.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can cause dehydration, neurological symptoms, and increased risk of seizures.
5. DVT/IVC Filter: The patient has a history of D"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several significant health conditions. The patient is suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, digit ischemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient's respiratory condition is critical, requiring high levels of mechanical ventilation with high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) and positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP). The patient's oxygenation is being monitored, and once it permits, there are plans to decrease PEEP.

The patient also has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver injury or dysfunction. Hep serologies are pending, suggesting a possible infection or other hepatic abnormalities.

The patient has been diagnosed with renal failure or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There has been a slow improvement in renal function, but no additional intervention has been mentioned.

The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water boluses to correct the sodium imbalance.

Other medical issues include digit ischemia, where there is a slow progression towards likely amputation in the future, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, and no clear infectious source for the fever, which is still present.

The patient's nutritional support includes repletion with fiber and glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, with blood sugar well controlled and insulin in total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient's lines include an arterial line"

   right-sided chest tube. The previously identified right-sided
   pneumothorax is
   now much smaller. A moderate right-sided pneumothorax persists.
   Increased
   opacities involving both lungs is again noted and remains unchanged on
   the
   left. The remaining support lines are unchanged. Again noted is
   termination
   of the feeding tube at the tip of the GE junction. Cardiomediastinal
   contours
   are similar in appearance. There is mild blunting of the left
   costophrenic
   angle. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
   IMPRESSION:
   Interval placement of right-sided chest tube.
   Persistent moderate right-sided pneumothorax, improved when compared to
   the
   previous study.
   Airspace opacity involving the bilateral lungs, unchanged on the left.
   The feeding tube is again noted to terminate at the level of the GE
   junction.
   The feeding tube should be advanced.
   The
feeding tube
 is actually esophageal balloon.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, PCP pneumonia, and pancreatitis. He presented with hypoxia and was found to have a right pneumothorax on chest X-ray. A chest tube was placed, and the pleural effusion was drained. The patient has been on antibiotics for Legionella-positive pneumonia and is now off antibiotics. He is still experiencing difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation due to ARDS. The patient has been slowly improving but progress has been stagnant recently. 

The patient has a history of anemia, which may be due to ongoing blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, or gastrointestinal losses. Blood draws, guaiac stools, haptoglobin levels, and B12 levels are pending. The patient also has non-gap metabolic acidosis, possibly related to renal tubular acidosis. He has a history of acute kidney injury, which is being monitored and medications are being renally dosed. The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to free water loss from high fevers, and his sodium levels are being managed accordingly. 

The patient's HIV status is being monitored, and HAART therapy is being withheld for now due to low viral load and high CD4 count. The patient is currently receiving nutrition support and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement

   right-sided chest tube. The previously identified right-sided
   pneumothorax is
   now much smaller. A moderate right-sided pneumothorax persists.
   Increased
   opacities involving both lungs is again noted and remains unchanged on
   the
   left. The remaining support lines are unchanged. Again noted is
   termination
   of the feeding tube at the tip of the GE junction. Cardiomediastinal
   contours
   are similar in appearance. There is mild blunting of the left
   costophrenic
   angle. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
   IMPRESSION:
   Interval placement of right-sided chest tube.
   Persistent moderate right-sided pneumothorax, improved when compared to
   the
   previous study.
   Airspace opacity involving the bilateral lungs, unchanged on the left.
   The feeding tube is again noted to terminate at the level of the GE
   junction.
   The feeding tube should be advanced.
   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now ARDS [**2-20**] Legionella c/b DIC, [**Last Name (un) **],

   #. Hypoxemic Resp Failure
   ARDS following Legionella Positive pneumonia.  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**].  Now off
   antibiotics, s/p course of levofloxacin for legionella.
   Improving slowly or stagnation of progress at this point.
   Still on PRVC ventilation w/ high driving pressures.  Now w/ right
   sided pneumothorax, possibly caused by high pressures, barotrauma in
   setting of ARDS.
   Goal diurese 1 L negative.
   Will cont vent settings as are for now, and eval for possible changes
   w/ decrease in driving pressure >> other changes.
   Some concern for VAP, however given fever (much improved) and white
   blood cell count trends, holding off on therapy.
   Broad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime) may have caused fevers;
   alternatively, may have partially treated infection and now seeing
   improvement clinically after this.  Will have to cont to follow daily
   CXR, fever and WBC# trends.
   - goal PaO2 >65; currently patient meeting goal.
   - cont acetaminophen for fever- still continues to spike despite
   antibiotics
   - cont nebs
   - diurese, neg 1 L goal
   # Anemia
   Slow ongoing blood loss? HCT down 7 pts in 1 week.  Blood draws, vs
   nutritional (albumin dropping), gi losses vs chest tube placement, vs
   lysis.
   Will guiac stools.  Add on haptoglobin (LDH has been elevated, t bili
   not)
   Goal transfusion > 21.
   Folate recently wnl.
   Will check B12 w/ high MCV.
   # Acidosis

The patient presented with hypoxia and was found to have a right pneumothorax, which required surgical placement of a chest tube for drainage. The patient also had a right pleural effusion that was effectively drained. Tylenol was changed to PRN to evaluate the fever curve. The patient has no known drug allergies and received cefipime antibiotics on [**2106-5-6**]. They are currently on fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation, respectively. Heparin sodium was given for thrombosis prophylaxis starting on [**2106-5-9**], and famotidine (Pepcid) was administered as well. The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged from admission. Review of systems is unchanged except as noted below.

   can attain fluid, will send for culture, gram stain.
   Will cont vent settings as are for now, and eval for possible changes
   w/ decrease in driving pressure >> other changes.
   Now off antibiotics, s/p course of levofloxacin for legionella.
   Some concern for VAP, however given fever (much improved) and white
   blood cell count trends, holding off on therapy.
   Broad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime) may have caused fevers;
   alternatively, may have partially treated infection and now seeing
   improvement clinically after this.  Will have to cont to follow daily

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, now ARDS following Legionella-positive pneumonia, pancreatitis, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, hyperthermia, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and elevated pancreatic enzymes. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with PRVC mode and has a right-sided pneumothorax, which may be caused by high ventilation pressures leading to barotrauma. A chest tube has been placed to drain the pleural effusion, and cultures will be obtained if possible. The patient's fever has improved, but they continue to have spikes, and there is uncertainty regarding an infectious cause or drug fever. Antibiotics have been stopped, and the patient will be monitored for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's DIC is stable, and anticoagulation has been held due to blood in the endotracheal tube. The patient has a history of DVT and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. There is concern for amputation in the future due to vascular issues. The patient's acute kidney injury is improving, and medications will be renally dosed. The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to large free water loss from high fevers, and free water flushes will be continued. The patient"

   termination
   of the feeding tube at the tip of the GE junction. Cardiomediastinal
   contours
   are similar in appearance. There is mild blunting of the left
   costophrenic
   angle. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle.

   Interval placement of right-sided chest tube.
   Persistent moderate right-sided pneumothorax, improved when compared to
   the
   previous study.
   Airspace opacity involving the bilateral lungs, unchanged on the left.
   The feeding tube is again noted to terminate at the level of the GE

   Broad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime) may have caused fevers;
   alternatively, may have partially treated infection and now seeing
   improvement clinically after this.  Will have to cont to follow daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, now ARDS following Legionella-positive pneumonia. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, acidosis, hyperthermia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and elevated pancreatic enzymes.

The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS and is currently on PRVC ventilation with high driving pressures. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but it is being closely monitored along with daily chest X-rays.

The patient has experienced significant blood loss leading to anemia, with a decrease in hematocrit (HCT) of 7 points in one week. The cause of the blood loss is unclear and may be due to ongoing blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, gastrointestinal losses, or chest tube placement. 

The patient also has a non-gap metabolic acidosis of unknown etiology. There is ongoing improvement in renal function after previous radiocontrast dye load, which caused acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to large water loss from high fevers. Free water deficit is 3.4 liters, and free water flushes are being given.

There is an elevation in pancreatic enzymes, but without evidence of pancreatitis on CT scan. It is likely medication-induced or possibly related to hyp"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV admitted to the ICU for Legionella PNA, respiratory failure, sepsis following APC (arterial line placement catheter), DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), and DVT (deep vein thrombosis) with an IVC (inferior vena cava) filter. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/61 to 124/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode, set tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure of 41 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 29 cmH2O.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 247 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL, low platelet count of 245 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 125 mg/dL, and altered liver function tests with increased ALT and AST levels.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with severe Legionella PNA/ARDS. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires respiratory support through a ventilator. The vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate, but the patient is experiencing low oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels despite being on 50% FiO2. The patient's chest tube was placed due to pneumothorax, and there is still some improvement needed as the lung is not fully expanded.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a low hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, as well as elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 247 K/uL, indicating possible infection. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), abnormal electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, and phosphorus), and elevated kidney function markers (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows respiratory acidosis.

The patient's medical history includes Legionella PNA/ARDS, obesity, and possible endotracheal intubation. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side and rales at the right base, suggesting ongoing respiratory issues.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to immunosuppression from prolonged mechanical ventilation, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and potential bleeding risks due to coagulopathy indicated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and recent Legionella infection.
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure following Legionella-positive pneumonia.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities including DIC, pancreatitis, DVT, and persistent high fevers of unclear etiology.
- The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation and has a chest tube in the right chest for pneumothorax.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 103/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, and elevated liver enzymes.
- Imaging shows bilateral airspace opacities and pleural effusions, which are consistent with pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia.
- The patient is currently on several medications including antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, diuretics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral airspace opacities on imaging suggest the possibility of ARDS. This is a serious condition characterized by severe lung inflammation leading to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and recent Legionella infection. The patient has been experiencing high fevers, and multiple complications have been identified. 

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. This condition can lead to difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. He has completed a course of antibiotics for this infection.

3. Barotrauma: The patient developed a right-sided pneumothorax, which may be due to high pressures from mechanical ventilation. This has been managed by placing two chest tubes.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. The cause of this anemia could be ongoing blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, gastrointestinal losses, or hemolysis.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient previously had AKI with urine sediment showing granular casts suggestive of acute tubular necrosis. However, his kidney function is now improving.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which could be due to significant free water loss from high fevers.

7. HIV: The patient's HIV infection is being managed with antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, it is currently"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV who was admitted with Legionella pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digit ischemia. The patient's course has been complicated by barotrauma and pneumothorax (PTX). He required the placement of a second chest tube due to persistent PTX. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

24-hour events include the placement of a second chest tube and attempted diuresis with Lasix. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 73-97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 77-115 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP at 12 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and plateau pressure at 25 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 276 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 123 mg/dL, elevated creatinine at 2.4 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now [**Year (4 digits) 509**] [**2-20**] Legionella c/b DIC, [**Last Name (un) **],
   and pancreatitis, also interval development of R pneumothorax
   # Hypoxemic Resp Failure
   [**Last Name (un) 509**] following Legionella pneumonia.  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**].  Now off
   antibiotics, s/p course of levofloxacin for legionella. Improving
   slowly.   pneumothorax noted, possibly caused by high pressures,
   barotrauma in setting of [**Name Initial (PRE) 509**].  Now s/p chest tubes x2 with resolution
   of pnx and removal of 1 chest tube
   - Continue to follow chest tubes with thoracics.
   - Will continue to attempt to decrease PEEP (down to 8 today),
   especially given barotrauma of right pneumothorax. And decrease FiO2 as
   tolerated
   - Goal PaO2 >65; currently patient exceeding goal.
   - Cont nebs
   - cont to decrease midazolam as tolerated and continue AM wake-ups.
   Start methadone to decrease fentanyl/midaz as tolerated as methadone
   started
   - send chest tube fluid for pleural effusion studies
   # Anemia
   Slow ongoing blood loss? HCT down 7 pts in 1 week.  Blood draws, vs
   nutritional (albumin dropping), gi losses vs chest tube placement, vs
   lysis (though lysis unlikely given labs)
   - cont guaiac stools
   - Haptoglobin wnl. (LDH has been elevated, t bili not). Folate recently
   wnl, B12 elevated
   - Continue to monitor, transfuse >21, patient receiving one unit this
   morning.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Previously w/ urine sediment with granular casts c/w ATN then
   radiocontrast dye load. Now cont to decrease and improve overall.
   - Cont to monitor.
   - Will renally dose medications.
   # Hypernatremia-
   - cont free water boluses as hypernatremic again
   # HIV- hold HAART for now; low VL and high CD4.  new CD4 is 260
   # Dispo: Discuss the possibility of trach with family today in family
   meeting. If they are amenable, will discuss with surgery/IP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now presenting with Legionella pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing various complications, including anemia, pancreatitis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and DIC. The patient has undergone multiple interventions, such as chest tube placement for pneumothorax, blood product transfusions, and antibiotic treatment. The patient's current condition is stable, but ongoing monitoring and management are required.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to Legionella pneumonia and subsequent pneumothorax. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be necessary to ensure adequate gas exchange. Further adjustments to PEEP and FiO2 may be required based on the patient's response.

2. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be attributed to ongoing blood loss from multiple factors, including gastrointestinal losses, chest tube placement, and possibly hemolysis. Continued monitoring of hemoglobin levels and ongoing transfusion support may be necessary.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of AKI, possibly due to radiocontrast dye exposure and ATN. Ongoing monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications based on renal dosing will be crucial.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected through free water boluses. Careful"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now [**Year (4 digits) 509**] [**2-20**] Legionella c/b DIC, [**Last Name (un) **],
   and pancreatitis
   # Hypoxemic Resp Failure
   [**Last Name (un) 509**] following Legionella pneumonia.  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**].  Now off
   antibiotics, s/p course of levofloxacin for legionella. Improving
   slowly.   Still on PRVC ventilation, PEEP decreased throughout the day
   yesterday after right sided pneumothorax noted, possibly caused by high
   pressures, barotrauma in setting of [**Name Initial (PRE) 509**].  Now s/p chest tubes x2 with
   resolution of pnx.
   - Continue to follow chest tubes with thoracics.
   - Goal diurese -500 cc to 1 L negative w/ lasix gtts
   - Will continue to attempt to decrease PEEP (down to 10 today),
   especially given barotrauma of right pneumothorax.
   - Goal PaO2 >65; currently patient exceeding goal.
   - Cont nebs
   # Anemia
   Slow ongoing blood loss? HCT down 7 pts in 1 week.  Blood draws, vs
   nutritional (albumin dropping), gi losses vs chest tube placement, vs
   lysis.
   - Will guaiac stools.
   - Haptoglobin wnl. (LDH has been elevated, t bili not). Folate recently
   wnl.
   - B12 elevated
   - Continue to monitor, transfuse >21, patient receiving one unit this
   morning.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Previously w/ urine sediment with granular casts c/w ATN then
   radiocontrast dye load. Now cont to decrease and improve overall.
   - Cont to monitor.
   - Will renally dose medications.
   # Hypernatremia- Likely large % free H20 loss from high fevers. Was
   improving, high Na again this morning in the setting of diuresis.
   - Will increase free water boluses as hypernatremic again
   # HIV- hold HAART for now; low VL and high CD4
   # Dispo: Now greater than 2 weeks intubated. Making some improvements
   in ventilator weaning, though unlikely that patient will be extubated
   in the near future as he is still requiring high PEEP/FiO2.
   - Discuss the possibility of trach with family over the next few days.
   If they are amenable, will discuss with surgery/IP.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now presenting with Legionella pneumonia.
- The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and potential HIV-related issues.
- The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation for over two weeks due to respiratory failure.
- The patient's condition has been improving slowly, with decreasing PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
- The patient has undergone chest tube placement for pneumothorax and has shown resolution of the pneumothorax.
- The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss or anemia.
- The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to high fever and free water loss.
- The patient's renal function has improved since the radiocontrast dye exposure.
- The patient's HIV status is being monitored, and HAART therapy is currently withheld.
- The patient's current disposition is to remain in the ICU, with discussions regarding tracheostomy placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Barotrauma: The patient's high pressures during ventilation may lead to further lung injury and barotrauma.
2. Nosocomial pneumonia: Prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobil"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M  HIV, h/o PCP pneumonia, now [**Year (4 digits) 509**] [**2-20**] Legionella c/b DIC, [**Last Name (un) **],
   and pancreatitis
   # Hypoxemic Resp Failure
   [**Last Name (un) 509**] following Legionella pneumonia.  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 442**].  Now off
   antibiotics, s/p course of levofloxacin for legionella. Improving
   slowly.   Still on PRVC ventilation, PEEP decreased throughout the day
   yesterday after right sided pneumothorax noted, possibly caused by high
   pressures, barotrauma in setting of [**Name Initial (PRE) 509**].  Now s/p chest tubes x2 with
   resolution of pnx.
   - Continue to follow chest tubes with thoracics.
   - Goal diurese -500 cc to 1 L negative w/ lasix gtts
   - Will continue to attempt to decrease PEEP (down to 10 today),
   especially given barotrauma of right pneumothorax.
   - Goal PaO2 >65; currently patient exceeding goal.
   - Cont nebs
   # Anemia
   Slow ongoing blood loss? HCT down 7 pts in 1 week.  Blood draws, vs
   nutritional (albumin dropping), gi losses vs chest tube placement, vs
   lysis.
   - Will guaiac stools.
   - Haptoglobin wnl. (LDH has been elevated, t bili not). Folate recently
   wnl.
   - B12 elevated
   - Continue to monitor, transfuse >21, patient receiving one unit this
   morning.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Previously w/ urine sediment with granular casts c/w ATN then
   radiocontrast dye load. Now cont to decrease and improve overall.
   - Cont to monitor.
   - Will renally dose medications.
   # Hypernatremia- Likely large % free H20 loss from high fevers. Was
   improving, high Na again this morning in the setting of diuresis.
   - Will increase free water boluses as hypernatremic again
   # HIV- hold HAART for now; low VL and high CD4
   # Dispo: Now greater than 2 weeks intubated. Making some improvements
   in ventilator weaning, though unlikely that patient will be extubated
   in the near future as he is still requiring high PEEP/FiO2.
   - Discuss the possibility of trach with family over the next few days.
   If they are amenable, will discuss with surgery/IP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and current presentation of Legionella pneumonia, resulting in Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), anemia, and pancreatitis. The patient is still on mechanical ventilation with PRVC mode and decreased PEEP. There is a concern for barotrauma due to a right-sided pneumothorax, which has been managed with chest tube placement. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, but there are ongoing concerns regarding fluid balance, respiratory support, anemia, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and HIV management. The patient has been intubated for greater than two weeks and is unlikely to be extubated soon. Tracheostomy is being considered for long-term airway management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Barotrauma: The patient's high pressures may lead to further lung injury and complications such as pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current AKI could progress if renal function is not closely monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's ongoing blood loss and inadequate nutritional intake may worsen his anemia, leading to further complications.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV admitted with Legionella pneumonia, sepsis, acute respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digit ischemia. The patient has been febrile but is now showing improvement. The patient also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), barotrauma, and pneumothorax. The patient has been off all antibiotics since 5-6 days ago. The patient has a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, and no heparin due to endotracheal tube (ETT) bloody secretions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the patient remains critically ill. The patient's oxygenation is improving, and the plan is to continue weaning the PEEP down. The patient will require a tracheostomy once the PEEP is in a safe range. The patient's sedation regimen includes fentanyl and versed, with plans to decrease the doses of both medications daily. The patient's anemia workup is pending but so far negative. The patient's acute kidney injury (ARF) Cr is unchanged. Other issues are noted in the resident's note. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status. The patient's family has been informed about the clinical status, progress,"

   - Continues to require ventilator support, though oxygenation improving
   -Continue to wean PEEP down as tolerated; maintain AC ventilation
   -Given length of time on MV and potential for long ventilator wean,
   discuss possible trach w/family
   #Sedation
   Fent 350, Versed 7.
   Start methadone IV 40mg, then 20mg tid. Goal decrease versed by 2mg
   daily and fent 50-75mcg daily. Can bolus fent if necessary.
    #PTX s/p 2 chest tubes- no leak
   #Anemia: unclear source, no obvious bleeding source.
   - Guaiac stools
   -Anemia w/u pending but so far negative
   -goal Hbg>7
   #Acidosis: unchanged, no acute intervention

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV admitted with Legionella pneumonia, sepsis, acute respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and digit ischemia. He has undergone activated protein C therapy and has a history of right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed. The patient has been febrile but is now showing improvement.

The patient is still experiencing acute respiratory failure and requires ventilator support. His oxygenation is improving, and the plan is to continue weaning the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) down as tolerated while maintaining assisted-controlled (AC) ventilation. The possibility of tracheostomy is being discussed with the family due to the potential for a long ventilator wean.

The patient is heavily sedated with fentanyl and Versed. Methadone is being started to help wean off Versed and fentanyl gradually.

The patient has had a pneumothorax (PTX) that has been treated with chest tubes, which show no air leak.

Anemia workup is pending, and there is a goal to maintain hemoglobin (Hgb) above 7.

The patient's acidosis remains unchanged without any immediate intervention required.

Acute renal failure (ARF) is present, and the creatinine level remains unchanged.

ICU care includes repletion with fiber, glycemic control"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, now presenting with Legionella pneumonia, pancreatitis, and right-sided pneumothorax. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and is HIV-positive. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, chest tube placement, blood transfusions, and renal dosing of medications. The patient's condition is improving slowly, but there are still several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
2. Prolonged ICU stay: Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, there is a risk of prolonged ICU stay, which can increase the chances of developing ICU-acquired infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or pressure ulcers.
3. Nosocomial delirium: Prolonged exposure to mechanical ventilation and sedatives can lead to delirium in critically ill patients. Regular assessment of mental status and cognitive function is important.
4. Multiorgan dysfunction: The patient's current conditions may progress to involve other organs, such as the kidneys or liver. Regular monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia now presenting with Legionella pneumonia, acute lung injury, and pancreatitis.
- Patient also has developed a right pneumothorax and required chest tube placement.
- The patient is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has been receiving mechanical ventilation.
- Blood cultures from arterial line are positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a possible line-associated bloodstream infection.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved with proning and Xigris therapy, but he still requires supplemental oxygen.
- He has been gradually weaned off sedation and is expected to undergo tracheostomy placement soon.
- The patient is anemic with a decreasing hematocrit and macrocytic anemia, possibly due to HIV medications, blood loss, or nutritional deficiencies.
- Renal function has improved from previous acute kidney injury, but the patient remains hypernatremic.
- HIV treatment is being held temporarily due to critical illness, and the patient has a low viral load and high CD4 count.
- The patient has an IVC filter in place and had transient heparin therapy for suspected DVT, but it was stopped due to decreased hematocrit and blood-tinged sputum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The positive blood cultures indicate a bloodstream infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now presenting with Legionella pneumonia. He has been experiencing multiple medical complications including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pancreatitis, anemia, and pulmonary pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. The patient is currently in the ICU, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. He also has bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus, coag-negative, and has an indwelling central venous line (CVL) in place. Other findings include acute kidney injury, hypernatremia, and a low CD4 count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, which could be a contaminant or indicate a true infection. Repeat cultures are pending, and the patient is currently on vancomycin. Surveillance cultures will be considered to evaluate for possible endocarditis.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to Legionella pneumonia. He has received treatment with levofloxacin for Legionella and has been proned and given Xigris. There is improvement, but the patient still requires mechanical ventilation.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient has developed a pneumothorax, possibly caused by high pressures leading to barotrauma. This has resulted in the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now presenting with Legionella pneumonia. He has been diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pancreatitis, anemia, and pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. The patient is currently experiencing bacteremia, likely due to invasive lines.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation in PRVC/AC mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 31 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 91%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophilia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated D-dimer, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb), and decreased platelet count (Plt). Other lab results indicate acute kidney injury (AKI) with an increase in serum creatinine (Cr) and uremia, as well as hypernatremia with a sodium level of 153 mEq/L.

The patient's anemia is characterized by ongoing blood loss, nutritional deficiency (albumin dropping), gastrointestinal losses, or lysis. The macrocytic anemia is more pronounced than on admission, and Vitamin B12 and folate levels are normal. 

The patient has acute kidney injury, previously associated with urinary sediment containing granular casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) after receiving radiocontrast dye. 

There is hypernatremia, which worsened overnight despite free water boluses. 

The patient's HIV status shows a low viral load and high CD4 count. HAART therapy has been held for now, and the patient will be discussed regarding when to restart HAART in critically ill patients.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, now ARDS, and recent development of right pneumothorax following chest tube placements. He is currently experiencing bacteremia with coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus, which is likely a contaminant. The patient has also been diagnosed with anemia, acute kidney injury (ATN), hypernatremia, and a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place.

The patient's current medications include midazolam, heparin sodium, famotidine, and methadone. He is also receiving IV fluids and tube feeds. The plan for the patient includes tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, weaning off sedation, and awakening the patient.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), and further deterioration of kidney function. Close monitoring and appropriate management strategies will be necessary to prevent and address these complications."

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has developed complications such as bacteremia, right pneumothorax, pancreatitis, and acute kidney injury. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a pressure-controlled mode and has had chest tubes placed for resolution of the pneumothorax. His current vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 133/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on FiO2 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Blood cultures have grown Staphylococcus aureus coag negative bacteria, which could be a contaminant. The patient is currently on vancomycin and awaiting speciation/sensitivities to adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.

The patient's plan includes tracheostomy placement, weaning off sedation, and awakening the patient. The goal is to maintain PaO2 >65, and the patient is tolerating a decrease in PEEP to 8 and FiO2 to 40%. The patient will be monitored closely, and further interventions will be based on the progress of his conditions."

The patient also has a diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia, which is being treated with levofloxacin. Additionally, the patient has developed right pneumothorax and pancreatitis.

The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by ARDS. He has undergone proning and received Xigris (activated protein C) therapy. The patient's condition is improving slowly. He has had two chest tubes placed for the resolution of pneumothorax, and one of the chest tubes has been removed.

The patient's sedation is being managed with midazolam, fentanyl, and methadone. He will undergo tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today. The plan is to continue decreasing midazolam as tolerated and continue AM wake-ups. Methadone will be used for weaning off other sedations.

The patient's recent laboratory results show anemia with low iron, TIBC, and reticulocyte index. He has acute kidney injury (ATN) but is resolving. His sodium level is elevated and will be managed with free water IV boluses. HIV treatment will be held off for now, considering the patient's critically ill condition.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and now ARDS. He has developed Legionella pneumonia, which led to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pancreatitis, and a right-sided pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. The patient is currently experiencing bacteremia with coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus, possibly a contaminant. He has been placed on vancomycin and awaiting speciation/sensitivities to adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.

The patient's condition is improving slowly, but he still requires mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has undergone proning and Xigris therapy for ARDS. Two chest tubes have been inserted to resolve the pneumothorax, and there is no air leak at present. The goal is to decrease sedation, awaken the patient, and consider switching to pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode.

Other issues include anemia likely due to severe illness, acute kidney injury (ATN) that is resolving, hypernatremia improving with free water IV, and a history of HIV with a low viral load and high CD4 count. The patient also has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, but heparin therapy was temporarily stopped due to decreased hematocrit and blood-tinged sputum."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV who is currently in the ICU. He has been diagnosed with ARDS following Legionella pneumonia, pancreatitis, anemia, and a pneumothorax. The patient has undergone chest tube placements and is now on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His current vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 143/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a history of PCP pneumonia and has developed DIC and anemia during his stay in the ICU. He has also shown signs of acute kidney injury and hypernatremia. The patient's HIV status is being closely monitored, and it has been decided to restart HAART therapy once the patient's condition improves. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and other ICU medications. He has an IVC filter in place and was previously on heparin for DVT treatment but had to be stopped due to low hematocrit and blood-tinged sputum. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is tracheostomy and peg tube placement.

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and ARDS secondary to Legionella pneumonia. The patient has also been diagnosed with pancreatitis, anemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and a chest tube was inserted due to a pneumothorax. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 143/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 4.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 350 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. Coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 14.8 seconds, elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 32.9 seconds, and low INR of 1.3. Cardiac biomarkers indicate elevated troponin-T level of 538 ng/mL, while liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are within normal range. Amylase and lipase levels are elevated, indicating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted with ARDS and Legionella infection. He has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement without event. The patient initially tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) weaning this morning. His hypernatremia persists, and he has recurrent fever of 101°F. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and there are no new positive culture results. The patient's sepsis has resolved, and he continues on antibiotics. He also has a resolved pneumothorax, altered mental status, extremity ischemia, acute renal failure, and deep venous thrombosis. An IVC filter has been placed, and he will restart heparin for chronic anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's increased right upper lobe infiltrate on imaging indicates a possible pneumonia. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially require changes in antibiotic therapy.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk for developing VAP. The healthcare team is implementing measures to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed, providing mouth care, and monitoring respiratory system pressure-volume loop (RSBI).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT, for which an IVC filter has been placed. Hepar"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo male with admission wish sepsis and respiratory failure with
   course complicated by significant and distant limb ischemia.
   Will, by problems-->
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Improved to point of tolerance of PSV
   -Has persistent fevers, sputum cultures suggesting persistent of gram
   negative rods but with clinical improvement
   -Would suggest expanded coverage for GNR's in setting of prolonged
   ventilator course if alternative sources not seen
   -Continue PSV wean
   2)Fever--Unclear origin
   -will pursue evaluation of hepatic source, and repeat sputum cultures
   -Will need to eval head CT, LENI, LFT's
   -If negative and fevers continue will pursue treatment for VAP
   -C-Diff negative
   3)Hypernatremia-
   Free water replacement
   Will evaluate FENa given persistent losses and concern for inadequate
   concentrating capacity
   4)Altered Mental Status-
   -Head CT--patient with new bilateral defects in posterior circulation
   distribution
   -MRI to follow up findings to consider true identification of findings
   -Follow exam

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis and respiratory failure.
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has shown improvement in respiratory function, tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- Persistent fevers and sputum cultures suggest ongoing infection with gram-negative rods (GNRs).
- The patient also has distant limb ischemia, which is a complication of his condition.
- Other issues include hypernatremia, altered mental status, and fever of unclear origin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure:
- Despite improvement, the patient may continue to have respiratory difficulties.
- Prolonged ventilator use increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Monitoring respiratory function and considering weaning from mechanical ventilation.

2. Fever:
- The origin of the fever is unclear, potentially due to a hepatic source or VAP.
- Further evaluation is needed, including repeat sputum cultures, head CT, liver enzyme levels (LENI), and LFTs.
- If negative, treating for VAP may be necessary.

3. Hypernatremia:
- The patient has elevated sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia.
- Free water replacement is necessary to correct this imbalance.
- Evaluation of the patient's fluid balance and concentrating capacity is essential.

4. Altered Mental Status:
- The patient's altered mental status may"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old male admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's course has been complicated by significant limb ischemia. The patient has developed fever, and there are concerns about possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently receiving treatment for presumed VAP, including vancomycin and cefepime.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) has been initiated. There are concerns regarding the patient's mental status, and a consultation with neurology has been requested. An MRI is also recommended to further evaluate the patient's condition.

The patient is hypernatremic but improving, and other issues are noted in the ICU team note. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being managed appropriately. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line, and prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to previous renal dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of limb ischemia, development of further infections, and neurological decline. It is crucial to follow the treatment plan and monitor the patient's response to the interventions implemented."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV and a history of PCP pneumonia and Legionella infection. He is currently in the ICU for ARDS, which was caused by Legionella pneumonia. The patient has also had pancreatitis, a right pneumothorax, and has undergone chest tube placement, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

The patient's 24-hour events include spiking fevers overnight to 101.2°F, tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV), and growing 1+ GNR in sputum cultures. The patient's mental status remains altered, with a CT scan showing possible infarct and reversible leukoencephalopathy. An MRI/MRA of the brain is planned today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS following Legionella pneumonia and is improving slowly. There is a possibility of recurrent pneumothorax due to high pressures causing barotrauma.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has fevers with GNR in sputum cultures, and a mini-balloon aspiration will be performed today to guide therapy. Empiric treatment for VAP with cefepime, vancomycin, and tobramycin has been started.
3. Coagulase-negative staph bacteremia: The patient had a blood culture positive for coagulase"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV, previous PCP pneumonia, and Legionella infection. He has been diagnosed with ARDS, DIC, pancreatitis, and developed a right pneumothorax, for which a chest tube was placed. The patient also underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Currently, he is experiencing spiking fevers overnight, with sputum culture growing 1+ GNR (Gram-negative rods). His mental status remains altered, and there are concerns of a possible stroke or reversible leukoencephalopathy. The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has shown improvements in respiratory function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of fever and sputum culture positive for GNR indicates a potential pneumonia. This could be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or a new infection.
2. Stroke: The altered mental status and the possibility of an infarct on the CT scan raise concerns for a stroke. Further imaging with MRI/MRA is planned to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Reversible Leukoencephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could also be attributed to reversible leukoencephalopathy, which is a condition involving inflammation of the white matter in the brain.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV history of PCP pneumonia and Legionella infection, who has developed ARDS, DIC, pancreatitis, and r-pneumothorax. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. They have also undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

The patient's current condition includes spiking fevers, altered mental status, and a CT head showing possible infarct and reversible leukoencephalopathy. The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has shown improvement in their respiratory status. However, they still require supplemental oxygen and have intermittent hypoxemia.

The patient has a history of anemia, acute kidney injury (ATN), hypernatremia, DVT, and HIV. They are currently on various medications including methadone, Heparin, Lansoprazole, Ritonavir, Reyataz, Combivir, and Tylenol.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's recent increase in sputum production and presence of GNRs indicate the possibility of VAP. The healthcare team plans to obtain a mini-BAL to guide therapy based on culture data.

2. Line-related infection: The patient's blood culture showed coagulase-negative staphylococcus,"

","The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and a small frontal/parietal infarcts that might be embolic in origin. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is receiving antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F, blood pressure ranging from 120/51 mmHg to 159/92 mmHg, heart rate between 63-106 bpm, respiratory rate between 9-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's neurological examination shows no assessment in peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic function due to intubation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 232 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL, platelet count of 87 mg/dL, sodium level of 28 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, and blood glucose level of 87 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been receiving heparin sodium infusion and other medications such as vancomycin, tobramycin, and cefepime for suspected VAP. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,356 mL and output of 3,110 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -754 mL. The patient's respiratory support indicates CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential embolic events due to the small frontal/parietal infarcts. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, laboratory values, and neurological function is necessary to prevent and manage any potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV and previous PCP pneumonia, currently admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. He has been hospitalized for over a month and has experienced multiple complications including r-pneumothorax, s/p chest tube placement, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy (PEG). The patient's mental status is altered, and there are multiple possible etiologies including stroke or reversible encephalopathy. MRI/MRA of the brain is planned today, along with an EEG and thyroid function tests. The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS following Legionella pneumonia, and he has been treated with levofloxacin, proning, and Xigris. There is improvement but with the development of pneumothorax, possibly caused by high pressures leading to barotrauma. Chest tubes were inserted, and one has been removed with resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient is now on water seal. There are fevers with GNR in the sputum, and a mini-BAL will be performed today to guide therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Empiric treatment with cefepime, vancomycin, and tobramycin for pseudomonas will be initiated. The patient has also had a coagulase-negative staph infection in the blood, which may represent a contaminant or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV, admitted to the ICU over a month ago with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Legionella pneumonia, and subsequent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient has a history of previous PCP pneumonia and is currently being treated for VAP with vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin. He is also on heparin sodium infusion and has an IVC filter in place for DVT prophylaxis. The patient has altered mental status, likely due to multifactorial causes including infection, methadone use, vascular causes, and possible hypoxic brain injury. An MRI showed PRES and two small frontal/parietal infarcts that may be embolic in origin, as well as a small enhancing mass in the occipital lobe, which could be an abscess, lymphoma, or toxoplasmosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's current condition is consistent with ARDS, which can lead to severe lung injury and respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia, which can progress to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to the prolonged use of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with HIV who was admitted with severe Legionella pneumonia, complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acrocyanosis with digital necrosis. He has ongoing fevers without other identified sources and remains obtunded. His brain imaging shows abnormal findings, with the final report pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, as indicated by his need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of hypoxemia (SpO2: 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2: 50%). There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to increased respiratory distress or the need for more advanced respiratory support.

2. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers despite antibiotic treatment. This could indicate an ongoing infection or the possibility of antibiotic resistance. It is important to identify the source of the infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.

3. Mental Status Changes: The patient is essentially obtunded, indicating altered mental status. The abnormal brain imaging suggests possible neurological involvement. Further evaluation by neurology is recommended to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 146 mEq/L. This electrolyte imbalance can lead to dehydration and increased risk of complications such as seizures or cerebral edema. Monitoring and management of fluid balance are crucial to correct this condition.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV admitted to the ICU for severe Legionella pneumonia, complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acrocyanosis with digital necrosis.
- The patient has ongoing fevers without a definitively identified source and remains obtunded (altered mental status).
- Brain imaging reveals abnormal findings, with the final report pending.
- The patient's mental status is being evaluated, and a lumbar puncture (LP) is planned if the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is normal.
- The patient's fever is unexplained, and cultures have been repeated. Sputum culture and mini-brain-associated lung fluid (BAL) culture have been obtained.
- The patient is being treated for presumptive ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin.
- The patient's respiratory failure is managed with pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials.
- The patient's hypernatremia is improving.
- Other ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP prevention.
- The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and the patient is critically ill.

   We have called the lab; they will not accept flow cytometry after 2pm.
   Since the flow is reported to not be useful if stored overnight, we
   will defer LP until tomorrow.  Will discuss with neurology, but our

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with HIV admitted to the ICU for severe Legionella pneumonia, complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acrocyanosis with digital necrosis. The patient has ongoing fevers without other definitively identified sources and remains essentially obtunded, meaning he is in a state of altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F (38.2°C), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 135/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 50%. The patient is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, decreased platelet count of 232 K/uL, and other abnormalities in kidney function tests, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and coagulation profile. Imaging studies reveal findings consistent with PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) versus infarcts, with the full read pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include mental status evaluation, fever management, respiratory failure management, hypernatremia correction, and other ICU care issues such as nutrition, glycemic control, line management"

","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HIV presenting with severe Legionella pneumonia, complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acrocyanosis with digital necrosis. The patient has ongoing fevers without other definitively identified sources and remains essentially obtunded. An evaluation of his altered mental status revealed abnormal brain imaging, with the final report of the MRI pending. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for critical care management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's severe Legionella pneumonia can progress to ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. This can lead to difficulty breathing and may require mechanical ventilation support.

2. Pneumonia Complications: Legionella pneumonia can lead to various complications such as abscess formation, pleural effusion, or septicemia. These complications can worsen the patient's respiratory status and overall prognosis.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): DIC is a serious condition characterized by the abnormal clotting of blood throughout the body. It can lead to organ damage and dysfunction. In this case, the patient's DIC may contribute to the development of microvascular thrombosis, leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis, particularly in the extremities.

4. Digital Cyanosis and Necrosis: The presence of digital cyanosis and necrosis indicates"

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaints include Legionella pneumonia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), digital cyanosis, and altered mental status. The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but was successfully weaned off and tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial. The patient's sodium levels were initially high, and free water flushes were given to correct it. Tobramycin levels were also monitored due to concerns about nephrotoxicity, and the drug was temporarily held. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Tobramycin, Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Acyclovir.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, blood pressure ranging from 103-182 mmHg, heart rate between 62-119 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient's weight has increased from 97.8 kg at admission to 103.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an input of 3,837 mL (including 939 mL IV fluids) and an output of 5,490 mL (including 1,870 mL urine). The patient is on tracheostomy ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 665 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7."

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 50-year-old man with HIV admitted with severe Legionella pneumonia, complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acrocyanosis with digital necrosis. He has ongoing fevers, altered mental status, and abnormal brain imaging. The patient has had a prolonged hospital course, over one month, and has been treated with various medications including levofloxacin for Legionella, proning, and Xigris. He has also undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS, which is improving slowly. He has been weaned off methadone and has shown more responsiveness today. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been treated empirically for VAP due to the presence of GNRs in the sputum culture. If the mini-bal (mini-bronchoalveolar lavage) is negative, antibiotics may be discontinued after 72 hours.

2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has coagulase-negative staphylococcus in the blood, which may represent a contaminant or bacteremia from a central line infection. If cultures from the line are positive, the line will be removed, and no further blood"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a complex medical history including HIV, Legionella ARDS, resolving DIC, and resolving acute renal failure. The patient is currently experiencing persistent poor mental status and has had a new onset of seizures this morning. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Seizures: The patient's new onset of seizures could be due to an infectious etiology or medication-related causes. The plan is to load Dilantin and perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to investigate further.

2. Fevers: Despite starting triple antibiotic therapy for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the patient's fevers persist. The differential diagnosis includes VAP, central nervous system (CNS) infection, and gangrenous hands. Adjustments to tobramycin dosing are needed, and repeat sputum cultures should be obtained.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required conversion to tracheostomy mask due to respiratory failure. However, the patient is oxygenating and saturating well with the current setup.

4. Fluid-Electrolyte Imbalance (FEN): Free water repletion is needed to address the patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalance.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter should be placed to prevent further clot formation, and heparin drip should be restarted after"

Summary:
- The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and altered mental status.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, tachypnea, dyspnea, and a seizure.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/78 mmHg to 182/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's current weight is 103.5 kg, with a height of 72 inches.
- Fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,837 mL and total output of 5,490 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,653 mL.
- Respiratory support includes ventilation with a tracheostomy mask, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 99%.
- Physical examination reveals coarse bilateral crackles in the chest, soft G tube in site, trace edema, eyes open but not following commands, and altered mental status.
- Lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 239 K/uL, elevated Cr at 1.7 mg/dL, low Hct at 22.0%, and other abnormalities in electrolytes, kidney function, and coagulation parameters.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient is currently in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple health concerns, including Legionella pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acrocyanosis, and HIV. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications. Notably, the patient has shown signs of bacterial meningitis, for which antibiotics have been added. There is also a concern about possible complications such as sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's multiple infections, including Legionella pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, and possible HIV, there is a high risk of sepsis developing. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.

2. Multiorgan Dysfunction: The presence of ARDS, DIC, and other systemic complications indicates a potential risk for multiorgan dysfunction. Continuous assessment of organ functions, including renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular systems, is crucial.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Frequent chest radiographs and cultures should be obtained to detect any changes in lung infiltrates or signs of infection.

4. HIV-related Opportunistic Infections: Considering the patient's HIV status, there is a possibility of developing opportunistic infections. Regular monitoring of CD4 count and"

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   #Altered Mental Status: Multifactorial [**2-20**] infection, methadone,
   vascular causes, possible hypoxic brain injury
 patient with prolonged
   hospital course of over 1 month CT with question of stroke vs.
   reversible leukencephalopathy.  PRES per prelim MRI although not
   thought to contribute to AMS per neurology, also small infarcts
   possible embolic. New myoclonus and hyperreflexia on exam.
   - discuss with neurology utility of repeat imaging
   # Hypoxemic Resp Failure
   ARDS following Legionella pneumonia. Now s/p course of levofloxacin for
   legionella.
   - pneumothorax noted s/p TC, no output from chest tube, call thoracics
   to remove tube
   - empiric treatment for VAP.  If negative growth from mini-BAL can d/c
   antibiotics after 72 hrs.  Would favor d/c cefepime, vanco, tobra given
   negative sputum cx on [**5-16**] and ngtd on [**5-17**] with negative gram stain
   - s/p trach/peg
   - on trach mask with good oxygenation
   #ID/Fevers.  Had slight recrudesence of fevers over the past few days
   in setting of sputum culture with 1+ GNRs, increased sputum
   production.  Will treat as above for VAP with vanco/cefepime/tobra.  LP
   yesterday showing WBC of 5, 2+ polys and no organisms seen. Added
   ampicillin to regimen to cover for bacterial meningitis. Follow up flow
   cytometry and viral cx and PCR for [**Male First Name (un) 561**], EBV, toxo, HIV, HSV
   - all other cx NGTD
   - continue with vanco, tobra, cefepime, acyclovir and amp
   - will adjust abx per peak and trough
   - tobra 2.2 and 5.7 for tobra, vanco level pending
   -continue to culture if spikes
   -tylenol d/c to follow fever curve
   -f/u other cultures
   # Anemia- likely now in the setting of severe illness given low iron,
   TIBC, and low retic index (0.9)
   - cont guaiac stools
   - iron liquid supplement
   - Continue to monitor, transfuse >21, stable today
   # Acute Kidney Injury- ATN resolved, creatinine down to 0.6
   # HTN- let patient autoregulate since may need high perfusion pressure
   to brain
   # Hypernatremia- Improved with free water replacement suggesting
   hypovolemic hypernatremia instead of DI.  Patient with urine osms c/w
   presence of ADH.
   - increased free water boluses and continue with
 normal saline today,
   sodium 146
   # HIV- restarted HAART
   # DVT: Has IVC filter in place.   On heparin gtt and plan to pull IVC

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is Legionella pneumonia, ARDS, DIC, acrocyanosis, and HIV. The patient has been in the ICU for over a month with multiple medical complications. The patient's current vital signs show fever, hypertension, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following Legionella pneumonia. The patient has undergone several interventions including mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and chest tube insertion. 

The patient's blood cultures showed the presence of GNRs, and they have been treated empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin. Additionally, the patient has been placed on droplet precautions due to suspicion of bacterial meningitis. 

The patient's neurological status has deteriorated, with new onset myoclonus and hyperreflexia. There are concerns about hypoxic brain injury, reversible leukencephalopathy, and possible stroke. Repeat imaging is recommended to discuss with neurology. 

The patient also has anemia, acute kidney injury (resolved), hypertension, hypernatremia (improved), HIV, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place, and pain control issues. 

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and their disposition is unknown."

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for over a month with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include Legionella pneumonia, ARDS, DIC, acrocyanosis, and HIV. The patient is experiencing fever, meningitis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, hypernatremia, and a history of DVT.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, increased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antiepileptics. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated D-dimer levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS following Legionella pneumonia. The patient is being treated with levofloxacin for Legionella.

2. Neurological issues: The patient is experiencing seizures, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and altered mental status. Imaging studies reveal possible reversible leukencephalopathy and small infarcts, which may be embolic in origin. Further imaging and EEG are planned to monitor the patient's neurological condition.

3. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is oxygenating well on a tracheostomy mask. A pneumothorax occurred during tracheostomy placement, and the chest tube"

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   #Altered Mental Status: Multifactorial [**2-20**] infection, methadone,
   vascular causes, possible hypoxic brain injury
 patient with prolonged
   hospital course of over 1 month CT with question of stroke vs.
   reversible leukencephalopathy.  PRES per prelim MRI although not
   thought to contribute to AMS per neurology, also small infarcts
   possible embolic. New myoclonus and hyperreflexia on exam.
   -          discuss with neurology utility of repeat imaging
   -          follow up EEG
   -          consider weaning methadone today
   -          continue with dilantin and check level today
   # Hypoxemic Resp Failure
   ARDS following Legionella pneumonia. Now s/p course of levofloxacin for
   legionella.
   - pneumothorax noted s/p TC, no output from chest tube, call thoracics
   to remove tube
   - empiric treatment for VAP.  If negative growth from mini-BAL can d/c
   antibiotics after 72 hrs.  Would favor d/c cefepime, vanco, tobra given
   negative sputum cx on [**5-16**] and ngtd on [**5-17**] with negative gram stain
   - s/p trach/peg
   - on trach mask with good oxygenation
   #ID/Fevers.  Had slight recrudesence of fevers over the past few days
   in setting of sputum culture with 1+ GNRs, increased sputum
   production.  Will treat as above for VAP with vanco/cefepime/tobra.  LP
   yesterday showing WBC of 5, 2+ polys and no organisms seen. Added
   ampicillin to regimen to cover for bacterial meningitis. Follow up flow
   cytometry and viral cx and PCR for [**Male First Name (un) 561**], EBV, toxo, HIV, HSV
   - all other cx NGTD
   - continue with vanco, tobra, cefepime, acyclovir and amp
   - will adjust abx per peak and trough
   - tobra 2.2 and 5.7 for tobra, vanco level pending
   -continue to culture if spikes
   -tylenol d/c to follow fever curve
   -f/u other cultures
   # Anemia- likely now in the setting of severe illness given low iron,
   TIBC, and low retic index (0.9)
   - cont guaiac stools
   - iron liquid supplement
   - Continue to monitor, transfuse >21, stable today
   # Acute Kidney Injury- ATN resolved, creatinine down to 0.6
   # HTN- let patient autoregulate since may need high perfusion pressure
   to brain
   # Hypernatremia- Improved with free water replacement suggesting
   hypovolemic hypernatremia instead of DI.  Patient with urine osms c/w
   presence of ADH.
   - increased free water boluses and continue with
 normal saline today,
   sodium 146
   # HIV- restarted HAART

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical complications, including Legionella pneumonia, ARDS, DIC, acrocyanosis, HIV, and meningitis. The patient has been in the ICU for over a month and has had a prolonged hospital course. He has been treated with various medications, including levofloxacin for Legionella pneumonia and antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing fevers, altered mental status, hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, hypernatremia, and a history of DVT with an IVC filter in place. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Legionella pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory distress and potentially worsen the patient's ARDS.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS may continue to progress, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Meningitis: The patient's cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a white blood cell count of 5, indicating a concern for bacterial meningitis. This could lead to neurological complications and altered mental status.
4. VAP: The patient's risk factors for VAP include prolonged mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and immunosuppression due to HIV. If the patient develops VAP, it can lead"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of HIV and Legionella ARDS, and is currently experiencing poor mental status, new onset seizures, and a decline in neurologic status. The patient has been receiving various medications including acyclovir, cefipime, tobramycin, ampicillin, and vancomycin. He has also been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has experienced recurrent generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The differential diagnosis includes infectious etiology, medication-related causes (such as acyclovir or high-dose aminoglycosides), or methadone wean. Further evaluation is needed, and consideration should be given to reimaging the ring-enhancing lesion.
2. Fevers: Despite starting triple antibiotic therapy, the patient's fevers persist. The possible causes include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central nervous system (CNS) infection, or gangrenous hands. The tobramycin dosage should be adjusted, and repeat sputum cultures should be obtained. A vascular consult for the hands is also necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which could be due to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis or diabetes insipidus (DI). The urine electrolytes should be checked, and"

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of HIV and is currently experiencing Legionella ARDS, resolving ARF, and poor mental status. The patient also has a new onset of seizures, fever, hypernatremia, and gangrenous hands. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 140/71 to 183/104 mmHg, heart rate of 46 bpm, respiratory rate of 49 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient's new onset seizures may be due to an infectious etiology, possibly related to abnl LP (lumbar puncture) or medication side effects such as Acyclovir, high-dose aminoglycosides, or methadone wean.
2. Fevers: The patient's fevers may be attributed to various causes including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central nervous system infection, or gangrenous hands. Adjusting Tobramycin dosing, repeating sputum cultures, and consulting vascular surgery for gangrenous hands are recommended.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels may be caused by post-"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 50-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure.
- He has a history of HIV and is currently experiencing Legionella ARDS, resolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and acute kidney injury (AKI).
- The patient's mental status has been poor, with new onset seizures this morning.
- He has been on mechanical ventilation but has now been switched to a tracheostomy mask, oxygenating and saturating well.
- The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with recent fever.
- His blood pressure is high, and he has hypernatremia, which could be due to post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis or diabetes insipidus.
- The patient has a chest tube in place, which will be kept on water seal for 48 hours before removal.
- There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central nervous system (CNS) infection.
- The patient also has gangrenous hands and requires vascular consultation.
- Other issues include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pain management, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has developed new onset seizures, and the differential diagnosis includes infectious etiology with abnormal lumbar puncture (LP) results. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, and further data is needed."

   - During day continued with labile BP.
   - Repeat head CT with worsening edema, likely early herniation, started
   on aggressive BP control for PRES syndrome with nitro gtt, goal SBP <
   140.
   - Neurology -> impression is for worsening PRES [**2-20**] labile BP, no role
   for steroids as edema is vasogenic and steroids may worsen BP.
   Aggressive BP control.
   - ID -> ?regarding cryptococcus, toxo, or possibly immune

1. The patient's vital signs show labile blood pressure, with readings ranging from 116/59 mmHg to 181/102 mmHg. His heart rate is stable within the normal range, and his respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 14 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation remains at 99% with the aid of a tracheal mask.

2. The patient has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome). He is also being treated for possible infections, including cryptococcus and toxoplasmosis.

3. The patient has a history of chest tube placement, and it was clamped at 6 pm. Repeat chest X-ray in the morning is planned.

4. The patient's neurological status has been worsening, leading to concerns about early herniation. He has been started on aggressive blood pressure control to manage PRES syndrome.

5. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, along with abnormal liver function tests and elevated D-dimer levels. His kidney function appears to be impaired, as indicated by increased creatinine levels.

6. The patient's blood pressure is being controlled using nitroglycerin"

   24 Hour Events:
   - During day continued with labile BP.
   - Repeat head CT with worsening edema, likely early herniation, started
   on aggressive BP control for PRES syndrome with nitro gtt, goal SBP <
   140.
   - Neurology -> impression is for worsening PRES [**2-20**] labile BP, no role
   for steroids as edema is vasogenic and steroids may worsen BP.
   Aggressive BP control.
   - ID -> ?regarding cryptococcus, toxo, or possibly immune
   reconstitution.  Added cryptococcal ag but cannot be done b/c bloody
   tap, sent fungal culture instead and peripheral blood cryptococcal
   antigen.  Started empiric treatment for toxo with
   pyrimethamine/sulfadizine.  Interacts with dilantin so need AM level.
   - Met with family who were updated on events.  Unprompted raised issue
   of DNR/DNI.
   - CT Surgery: Chest tube clamped in PM.  Repeat CXR in AM.
   - 6pm: After discussion with Neuro/ID, started IV dexamethasone 10mg
   x1, and 4mg IV q6, mannitol 50mg IV x1.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 154/80 to 181/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy with an FiO2 of 60% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests reveal an elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and a decreased blood urea nitrogen level. Liver function tests are within normal limits, except for an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level. Electrolyte levels are mostly within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level and an elevated sodium level.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. The patient's chest X-ray demonstrates diffuse bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS.

   Total time spent: 30
","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with ARDS caused by Legionella pneumonia. He has developed cerebral edema and early herniation, leading to the initiation of comfort measures and morphine drip. The patient's goals of care are focused on comfort, and he has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient's CT scan showed profound cerebral edema, which can worsen and lead to increased intracranial pressure, further herniation, and potential brainstem compression.
2. Respiratory Failure: As an ARDS patient, he is at risk for progressive respiratory failure due to impaired gas exchange and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: Given his history of Legionella pneumonia, there is a possibility of ongoing infection leading to sepsis, especially considering his immunocompromised state from ARDS.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and ARDS increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as DVT and PE.
5. Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Severe ARDS can progress to MODS, involving dysfunction of multiple organ systems including the lungs, kidneys, liver, and cardiovascular system.
6. Autopsy Considerations: Given the patient's deteriorating condition and DNR status, there may be a need for discussions regarding autopsy"

   Code status: Comfort measures only
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HIV and pneumonia caused by Legionella. The patient has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The patient also has a ring-enhancing lesion, which requires further investigation.

The patient is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) and is receiving morphine for pain relief. The patient has had a chest tube placed and it was removed today.

In terms of medical complications that can arise, given the patient's condition and diagnosis, potential complications may include worsening ARDS leading to respiratory failure, progression of DIC resulting in bleeding or clotting disorders, further neurological deterioration due to PRES, and the possibility of the ring-enhancing lesion being indicative of a more serious underlying condition such as a brain abscess or malignancy.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, coagulation profile, neurological function, and any changes in the ring-enhancing lesion on imaging studies. Additionally, appropriate management of pain and comfort measures should continue to be prioritized."

","The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and other medical conditions. The patient has a history of sinus bradycardia and is currently on morphine sulfate infusion for pain management. 

Vital signs show a stable blood pressure ranging from 130/66 to 154/80 mmHg, heart rate between 51 and 69 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient's weight has increased from 97.8 kg at admission to 103.5 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 794 mL, with 606 mL through the gastrointestinal tract and 187 mL through intravenous fluids. The total output includes 2,970 mL of urine and 94 mL of NG output. This results in a fluid balance deficit of 2,176 mL.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Other lab results show elevated troponin-T and D-dimer levels, indicating possible cardiac injury and clotting abnormalities.

The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and pain management medications. The patient's"

   will discuss today whether they would like to have a repeat neurologic
   assessment in order to determine whether repeat imaging would assist in
   determining the immediate prognosis. This would help the family decide
   on whether hospice may be a more suitable option for them.
   Family would not like to pursue further neuro evaluation and would like
   to bring patient home with hospice services. Patient
s pain regimen
   will need to be either transitioned to oral regimen or a PICC line will
   need to be placed. Also S&S evaluation will be obtained to fit patient
   with a cap for tracheostomy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HIV, who presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia caused by Legionella, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acrocyanosis, digital ischemia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on MRI, and a ring-enhancing lesion. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to comfort measures only (CMO) status. The family has decided against further neurologic evaluation and prefers to take the patient home with hospice services. The patient's pain regimen will be transitioned to an oral regimen, and a cap will be fitted for tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: Due to ARDS and pneumonia, the patient is at risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial.
2. Sepsis: With the presence of pneumonia and DIC, there is a potential for sepsis. Regular monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
3. Bleeding Disorders: DIC can lead to abnormal bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters such as PT/INR and PTT is necessary to assess bleeding risk.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but close monitoring is still required to detect any sudden drops in blood pressure.
5. Hypoxemia: Given the patient's low oxygen saturation of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HIV, currently admitted to the ICU with hypoxia. He has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia caused by Legionella, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acrocyanosis, digital ischemia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on MRI, and a possible ring-enhancing lesion. The patient's family has made the decision for comfort measures only (CMO) and does not wish for further aggressive treatment. The patient is currently comfortable on morphine and had a chest tube removed yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: Given the patient's ARDS and pneumonia, there is a risk of worsening respiratory function, leading to further hypoxia and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The presence of pneumonia and DIC increases the risk of systemic infection and sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobility in the ICU and history of HIV may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Complications related to PRES: PRES is associated with neurological symptoms and can lead to complications such as seizures, altered mental status, or stroke.
5. Infection control: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and presence of pneumonia, there"
