   24 yo F with ESRD, malignant HTN, started PD earlier this week,
   presented with N/V/D, abd pain, and hypertensive urgency.
   # Nausea/Vomitting/Diarrhea/Abd Pain: Abd pain increasing, N/V/D
   resolving. DDx: Infection: c. diff colitis (Cx pending), peritonitis
   (PD catheter in place and source of infxn), viral gastroenteritis, SBP
   (unlikely as PD fluid Cx shows NGTD and without leukocytosis); and
   Ischemia: h/o thrombotic events and SLE vasculitis (ischemia unlikely
   given low lactate).
   - Appreciate surgery recs.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Serial Abd Exams
   - F/u Stool Studies
   - Continue Flagyl empirically
   - Will guaiac stoolsx3

   - Dilaudid for pain management
   - Re-assess peritoneal dialysis fluid today to re-assess PD-induced
   peritonitis.
   # Hypertensive urgency: O/N SBP <150 after started on PO meds
   yesterday, however, SBP increased this morning [**2-11**] pt did not take PO
   meds last night and [**2-11**] increased abd pain.
   -          Continue labetalol gtt. consider placing pt back on PO meds
   if pt can tolerate. SBP goal of <150.
   -          Pain control with Dilaudid

","The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, who presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

From the progress note, the patient has several medical complications that need attention:

1. Abdominal Pain: The patient has increasing abdominal pain, especially with oral intake. The pain is present in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), right lower quadrant (RLQ), and midline. The patient experiences relief from Dilaudid (hydromorphone) IV. Serial abdominal exams are being performed, and stool studies will be followed up.

2. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with a peak of 220 systolic blood pressure this morning. The patient did not take oral medications last night, which may have contributed to the increase in blood pressure. The current treatment involves labetalol infusion, and the goal is to maintain the blood pressure below 150 systolic.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are decreasing, with a current value of 130 mEq/L. This could be due to gastrointestinal losses and chronic renal failure (CRF). IV fluids have been discontinued, and electrolytes will be rechecked tomorrow.

4. ESRD: The patient has likely secondary ESRD, possibly due to systemic lupus erythematosus"

","The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, and peritoneal dialysis (PD) presentation. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. Her current condition includes severe gastric wall edema, multifocal small bowel wall thickening, large ascites, and unchanged appearance of hypodensity in the right liver lobe.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea/Abdominal Pain: The abdominal pain is increasing, while nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are resolving. Differential diagnoses include infection (such as Clostridium difficile colitis, peritonitis due to PD catheter infection), viral gastroenteritis, septic shock (unlikely given PD fluid culture showing no growth and absence of leukocytosis), and ischemia (unlikely given low lactate levels). The patient should continue with supportive care, serial abdominal exams, follow-up stool studies, continue Flagyl empirically, guaiac stool tests three times, and consider heparin gtt for treatment of possible thrombotic ischemia.

2. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure has increased this morning despite being on oral medications. She did not take her oral medications last night.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, and peritoneal dialysis (PD) who presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. She has been experiencing increasing abdominal pain, which is relieved by Dilaudid (hydromorphone). Her blood pressure has been fluctuating, reaching a high of 220 systolic this morning. The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 21.5% and decreased bicarbonate levels. She also has hyponatremia and hypocalcemia. The patient's medical history includes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a history of thrombosis. She is currently receiving treatment for her conditions and is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to her immunocompromised state from ESRD and the use of PD. The pending UCx and PD fluid Cx results may provide further information on this.
2. Ischemia: The patient's relative hypotension on [**11-11**] could suggest possible ischemia. Additionally, there is concern for a new thrombotic event.
3. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's elevated blood pressure poses a risk for hypertensive emergency, which can lead to organ damage if not promptly managed.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has recently started peritoneal dialysis (PD). Her abdominal pain has been increasing, and she has rebound tenderness in multiple quadrants. Her blood pressure has been fluctuating, with a recent spike to 220/135 mmHg. She is also experiencing hyponatremia, anemia, and metabolic acidosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an increased risk of infection due to her immunocompromised state from ESRD and SLE. Cultures are pending to rule out infections such as Clostridium difficile colitis, peritonitis, or pyelonephritis.
2. Ischemia: The patient's relative hypotension on [**11-11**] raises the possibility of ischemia. This could be caused by a new thrombotic event or relative hypotension due to SLE vasculitis.
3. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, including a significant increase to 220/135 mmHg. This could lead to complications such as intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, and a recent start of peritoneal dialysis (PD). She presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is currently on prednisone. Her vital signs show an elevated blood pressure of up to 220 mmHg, but otherwise stable parameters. The CT scan of the abdomen reveals large ascites, severe gastric wall edema, and multifocal small bowel wall thickening. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's anemia is likely due to decreased oral intake and diarrhea.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemia: The patient's relative hypotension on [**11-11**] may indicate reduced blood flow to certain organs, potentially leading to ischemia.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. Differential diagnoses include Clostridium difficile colitis, peritonitis, pyelonephritis, or viral gastroenteritis.
3. Thrombotic event: Given the patient's history of thrombosis, there is a risk of another thrombotic event occurring.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is low, indicating metabolic acidosis, which may be exacerbated by ongoing"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, and peritoneal dialysis (PD) who presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. The patient also has a history of thrombotic events and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) vasculitis.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, anemia, decreased bicarbonate, hypocalcemia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal large ascites, severe gastric wall edema with multifocal small bowel wall thickening, and hypodensity in the right liver lobe.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Infection: The patient has symptoms consistent with gastrointestinal infection, such as Clostridium difficile colitis. The pending culture results will help confirm this diagnosis.

2. Peritonitis: The patient's PD catheter may be the source of infection, leading to peritonitis. The PD fluid culture shows no growth of bacteria, but it is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection.

3. Ischemia: The patient's history of thrombotic events and SLE vasculitis raises the possibility of ischemic bowel disease. However, the low lactate levels suggest that ischemia is unlikely at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, who presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. She has been on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for a few days and has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient's symptoms include increasing abdominal pain, relief with Dilaudid, hypotension, and hypertension. Her laboratory results show hyponatremia, anemia, decreased bicarbonate, hypocalcemia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's condition is stable, and she is receiving supportive care, including pain management with Dilaudid, continuing PD, monitoring fluid balance, and rechecking electrolytes. Further diagnostic tests and treatments are planned based on the patient's response to current management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient may be at risk for peritonitis due to the PD catheter in place. The PD fluid culture shows no growth, but other sources of infection should also be considered.
2. Ischemia: There is a history of thrombotic events and SLE vasculitis, but ischemia seems unlikely given the low lactate levels.
3. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, and it is important to maintain it below 150 mmHg.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is hypertensive urgency and abdominal pain. The patient is unable to take oral medications, so they are being administered intravenously. The patient also has nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which could be due to viral gastroenteritis or other infections. Empirical treatment for C. difficile is being given, and tests are awaiting results. There is concern about possible involvement of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as well. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. They are also on prophylactic heparin for venous thromboses, unable to tolerate CPAP for obstructive sleep apnea, and require pain management. The patient's acid-base balance should be monitored, and pulmonary hypertension follow-up is needed. The patient's nutritional status is currently nil per os (NPO)."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 52-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock secondary to acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome). The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. He presents with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.

Upon admission, the patient was started on IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was also placed on bowel rest and NPO (nothing by mouth). The patient's initial laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.3 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 8.0 mg/dL, and signs of coagulopathy with a prolonged PT/INR of 16.8 and PTT of 150.0.

Repeat laboratory results from 10/15/2141 showed improvement in the patient's leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 6.4, but his lactate level remained elevated at 1.3 mmol/L. His coagulopathy did not improve with a continued prolonged PT/INR of 16.8 and PTT of 150.0. The patient's hemoglobin level dropped to 7.4 g/dL, and his platelet count decreased to 108 K/uL.

The patient's vital signs were relatively stable with a temperature of 36.9 C (98.4 F), heart rate of 82 bpm,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are still resolving. Differential diagnosis includes infection (Clostridium difficile colitis or viral gastroenteritis), ischemia (thrombotic event, malignant hypertension, or SLE vasculitis), and SLE enteritis. Surgery and rheumatology recommendations will be followed, and a gastrointestinal consult will be obtained to consider esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy for biopsy and visualization.

2. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure has been controlled, with a goal of keeping systolic blood pressure below 160. Labetalol infusion has been stopped, and medications such as labetalol, nifedipine, and clonidine will continue.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are decreasing, and potential etiologies include gastrointestinal losses and chronic renal failure. Intravenous fluids will be discontinued, and electrolytes will be rechecked tomorrow.

4. ESRD: The patient has estimated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. The patient has been on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for approximately two weeks and is currently on hemodialysis due to her inability to tolerate PD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient may be at risk for infections due to her immunocompromised state from SLE and ESRD. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood counts, and specific cultures should be performed if there are any signs or symptoms of infection.
2. Thrombotic Events: Given the patient's history of multiple thrombotic events, it is important to monitor for any new signs or symptoms of thrombosis, such as limb pain, swelling, or changes in coloration.
3. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent hypertensive urgency or emergency. Adjustments in medication and lifestyle modifications should be made accordingly.
4. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient's abdominal pain, positive stool guaiac, and history of SLE raise concerns for possible gastrointestinal involvement of SLE, including vasculitis. Further evaluation with endoscopy and biopsy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, and a recent peritoneal dialysis (PD) initiation. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. Her abdominal pain is increasing, while nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are resolving. The differential diagnosis includes infection (Clostridium difficile colitis, peritonitis), ischemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) vasculitis. The patient has been given supportive care, including pain management with dilaudid, and her PD fluid is being reassessed for possible peritonitis. She is also on empiric antibiotics and will have stool studies repeated. 

Hypertensive urgency is being treated with labetalol, and the goal is to maintain systolic blood pressure below 150. Hyponatremia is suspected due to gastrointestinal losses and chronic renal failure. IV fluids have been discontinued, and electrolytes will be rechecked tomorrow. ESRD is likely secondary to SLE, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 8 mL/min. Peritoneal dialysis is planned if the patient can tolerate it. Anemia is present with a hemoglobin level of 35.0 g/dL and normocytic cells. This is attributed to autoimmune hemolytic anemia (ACD) and chronic renal failure. A blood transfusion"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea/Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain has improved, and the symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are resolving. There is a trace positive stool guaiac, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Differential diagnoses include infection (such as Clostridium difficile colitis or viral gastroenteritis), ischemia (microthrombosis, malignant hypertension, or SLE vasculitis), and SLE enteritis. The plan includes consulting surgery for possible endoscopy and colonoscopy to assess for bowel biopsy/visualization, continuing supportive care and serial abdominal exams, following up on stool studies, and following rheumatology-SLE studies.

2. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and the goal is to maintain it below 150 systolic. The plan includes continuing oral medications (labetalol, nifedipine, and clonidine) and starting aliskiren. Hydralazine is held"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. 

Medical recommendations include:
1. GI consult for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy for bowel visualization and biopsy as needed.
2. Continue infectious work-up including stool studies, evaluation for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis or viral gastroenteritis.
3. Empiric antibiotic coverage for enteric pathogens.
4. Further evaluation for falling hematocrit and platelet, including reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, PF4 antibody, iron studies, vitamin B12, folate, stool guaiac.
5. Check anticardiolipin IgG, anticardiolipin IgM, and anti-beta2-glycoprotein.
6. If possible, perform a lupus anticoagulant assay by reversing heparin.
7. Check titers of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and levels of CH50, C3, and C4.
8. If the patient refuses oral prednisone 4 mg daily, provide equivalent intravenous (IV) dose of Solu-Medrol 4 mg daily to prevent symptoms related to adrenal insufficiency.

Surgical recommendations include bowel rest and nasogastric tube (NGT) lavage if hematocrit drops.
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 145/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has mild left upper extremity swelling but reports it as normal and has no pain or loss of function.

Lab results show elevated creatinine levels, low hemoglobin, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal liver function tests. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 8 mL/min. The patient's calcium level is low at 6.4 mg/dL, and she has metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: C. diff colitis or viral gastroenteritis.
2. Ischemia: microthrombosis, malignant hypertension, or SLE vasculitis.
3. SLE enteritis.
4. Hypertensive urgency: SBP >150.
5. Anemia: GI bleed, hemolysis, and ACD.
6. Hypocalcemia.
7. Metabolic acidosis.
8. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. The abdominal pain is increasing, while nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are resolving.

The patient's medical team is considering several potential complications and conditions, including:

1. Infection: There is a possibility of Clostridium difficile colitis (C. diff), peritonitis related to peritoneal dialysis (PD), viral gastroenteritis, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The team is waiting for stool studies and monitoring the patient's condition.

2. Ischemia: The patient has a history of thrombotic events and SLE vasculitis. However, ischemia seems unlikely given the low lactate levels.

3. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated despite being on oral medications. The medical team is continuing labetalol infusions and considering placing the patient back on oral medications if she can tolerate them.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are decreasing. Possible causes include gastrointestinal losses and chronic renal failure (CRF). The medical team is discontinuing intravenous fluids and will recheck electrolytes tomorrow.

5. ESRD: The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with hypertensive urgency and abdominal pain. She has a history of renal disease, hypertension, and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been unable to take her oral medications, resulting in uncontrolled hypertension. She also presents with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with a concern for viral gastroenteritis or other infections. The patient is being treated empirically for C. difficile while awaiting test results. She has undergone peritoneal dialysis and has shown improvement in pain control. The patient's current medications include prednisone, heparin, and dilaudid IV, with plans to convert her pain regimen to oral. She is also on a renal diet and receives prophylactic treatment for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's uncontrolled hypertension can lead to complications such as intracranial hemorrhage, aortic dissection, or hypertensive encephalopathy.
2. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms: These symptoms may indicate an underlying gastrointestinal condition, such as viral gastroenteritis, bacterial infection, or inflammatory bowel disease. If left untreated, it could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or sepsis.
3. Renal disease: The patient's pre-existing renal disease increases the risk of acute kidney injury or worsening renal function, which can be exacerbated by factors such as hypotension, dehydration, or certain medications.
4. Venous thromboses: As the patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin, there is a risk of bleeding complications. Monitoring the patient's coagulation parameters and ensuring appropriate dosing of anticoagulant medication is crucial.
5. Pulmonary hypertension: Although not currently an active concern, the patient may require follow-up for potential evaluation and management of pulmonary hypertension, which can be a long-term complication of chronic lung disease or other underlying conditions.
6. Infection: Given the patient's recent antibiotic exposure and presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, including C. difficile colitis. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.
7. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels need close monitoring due to her renal disease, gastrointestinal symptoms, and ongoing fluid management in the ICU.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 85-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency and abdominal pain. The patient has been seen by rheumatology and attempted peritoneal dialysis overnight. Currently, the patient has one PIV midline placed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 147/94 mmHg and a heart rate of 87 bpm. The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.25, indicating acidosis.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished general appearance, normal heart sounds, and tenderness improved in the abdomen. The patient has trace edema in both extremities and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement with normal tone.

Laboratory results show an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 47 mg/dL and creatinine level of 7.9. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is slightly elevated at 6.4 K/uL, while platelet count is within normal range at 134. Other lab results, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,777 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with hypertensive urgency and abdominal pain. She has a history of renal disease, lupus, and previous antibiotic exposure. She is currently in the ICU and has been undergoing various treatments and evaluations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
2. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal issues: The cause of the abdominal pain and symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea is unclear. It could be due to viral gastroenteritis, infection, or even lupus involvement. Empirical treatment for C. diff is being given while awaiting test results. Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.
3. Potential peritonitis: The patient is undergoing peritoneal dialysis, and there is a concern for peritonitis. Serial exams and fluid analysis will help exclude this condition.
4. OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea): The patient is unable to tolerate autoset, and outpatient follow-up is needed for further evaluation and management.
5. Pain management: The patient is experiencing pain, and efforts are being made to convert her pain regimen from IV to oral medications.
6. Lupus involvement: Lupus may play a role in her abdominal process, and rheumatology consultation has been requested to assess this possibility.
7. Venous thromboses:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. The patient has been receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) for approximately two weeks and is currently on PD with intermittent hemodialysis (HD). Her blood pressure remains uncontrolled, and she has a history of venous thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to her immunocompromised state from ESRD and SLE. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or changes in vital signs, is important.
2. Ischemia: The patient's history of thrombotic events and malignant hypertension puts her at risk for ischemia, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. Monitoring for signs of bowel ischemia, such as abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, is crucial.
3. Hypertensive urgency: Despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications, the patient's blood pressure remains elevated. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting medication dosages may be necessary to achieve blood pressure control.
4. Anemia: The patient has a decreasing hematocrit (HCT) level, indicating anemia. Further evaluation of etiologies, including GI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. The patient has a history of thrombotic events and is currently on warfarin therapy. She is also diagnosed with anemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and hyponatremia. The patient's current medications include heparin gtt for possible thrombotic ischemia, labetalol, nifedipine, clonidine, aliskiren, and prednisone. She is being treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 8 mL/min.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to SLE and chronic renal failure increases the risk of infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections and respiratory infections.
2. Thrombotic events: The patient's history of multiple thrombotic events and use of warfarin indicate a risk for further thrombosis, potentially leading to complications such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She is currently in the ICU for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. These symptoms could be due to an infection such as Clostridium difficile colitis or viral gastroenteritis. Further investigation is needed, including stool samples for infectious workup.
2. Ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain may also be caused by ischemia, which can result from microthrombosis, malignant hypertension, or SLE vasculitis. Further evaluation is required to determine the exact cause.
3. SLE enteritis: Given the patient's history of SLE, SLE enteritis should be considered as a potential cause of her GI symptoms.
4. Thrombotic events: The patient has a history of multiple thrombotic events and is currently on warfarin therapy. However, her INR levels have been variable, and there is a concern for potential thrombotic ischemia. Heparin gtt has been started to treat possible thrombotic ischemia, and warfar"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. She has been receiving supportive care and has shown improvement in her symptoms. However, she still requires further evaluation and management for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's recent use of antibiotics (metronidazole) and the presence of diarrhea may increase the risk of infection. Clostridium difficile colitis should be considered as a differential diagnosis.
2. Ischemia: The patient's low lactate levels suggest that ischemia is unlikely. However, the possibility of microthrombosis, malignant hypertension, or SLE vasculitis causing ischemia should be considered.
3. SLE enteritis: Given the patient's history of SLE, it is important to consider SLE enteritis as a potential etiology for her gastrointestinal symptoms.
4. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate ongoing uncontrolled hypertension. Appropriate management strategies need to be continued to achieve target blood pressure levels.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable hemoglobin levels but with a decreasing hematocrit. Etiologies of anemia include GI bleed, hemolysis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 24-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with hypertensive urgency.
- She has persistent abdominal pain, worsening hypertension, and is unable to take her oral medications due to allergies.
- She has been on various medications including heparin, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and other ICU medications.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure.
- She has received fluid resuscitation and is producing urine.
- The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels and low potassium levels.
- She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and renal disease.
- The assessment includes hypertensive urgency, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
- The plan involves managing hypertension with labetalol, treating empirically for C. diff, ruling out peritonitis in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid, addressing pain management, consulting rheumatology for SLE involvement, and discussing long-term anticoagulation and pulmonary hypertension follow-up.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's high blood pressure could lead to end-organ damage if not controlled promptly.
2. Infection: The presence of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea raises concerns for potential infections such as viral gastroenteritis or Clostridium difficile (C. diff).
3. Kidney injury: The elevated creatinine levels indicate possible"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease) on PD (Peritoneal Dialysis), malignant hypertension, SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/abdominal pain, hypertensive urgency, anemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's current medications include warfarin, prednisone, calcium carbonate, calcitriol, and various hypertensive medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of c. diff colitis or viral gastroenteritis, which can be exacerbated by immunosuppressive medications like prednisone.
2. Ischemia: The patient may be at risk for microthrombosis, malignant hypertension, or SLE vasculitis leading to ischemia in the gastrointestinal tract.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has positive guaiac positive stool, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed, which can be caused by conditions such as peptic ulcer disease or gastritis.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms may suggest pancreatitis, which can be caused by medications like prednisone or underlying conditions like SLE.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's estimated GFR is 8 mL/min, indicating severe renal impairment. It is important"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, previous superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/119 mmHg to 120/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea could be indicative of an infectious etiology such as Clostridium difficile colitis or viral gastroenteritis. The presence of guaiac-positive stool samples suggests a possible gastrointestinal bleed as well.
2. Ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated troponin levels raise concern for possible ischemia due to microthrombosis, malignant hypertension, or SLE vasculitis.
3. SLE Flare: The patient's history of SLE and current symptoms raise the possibility of an SLE flare contributing to her gastrointestinal symptoms.
4. Thrombotic Events: Given the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/119 mmHg to 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 21.4% to 24.5%. She has received a blood transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Her platelet count is 134,000/mm³. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (7.9 mg/dL), troponin T (0.08 ng/mL), lactic acid (0.6 mmol/L), and decreased levels of calcium (6.4 mg/dL), potassium (3.6 mEq/L), bicarbonate (12 mEq/L), and albumin (3.6 g/dL). The patient is currently on multiple medications including warfarin, morphine, aliskiren, hydralazine, nifedipine, clonidine, and calcium gluconate. She is scheduled for an urgent endoscopy today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with the presence of guaiac positive stools, suggest a possible gastrointestinal bleed. This could be due to conditions such as c. diff colitis, viral gastroenteritis, ischemia, or SLE vasculitis. Close monitoring of stool guaiacs and further stool studies are recommended.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently elevated, reaching a maximum of 200 systolic blood pressure. This puts her at risk for hypertensive crisis, which can lead to end-organ damage. Appropriate antihypertensive medications and close blood pressure monitoring are necessary.
3. Thrombotic events: The patient has a history of multiple thrombotic events, and she is currently on warfarin therapy. However, her INR is subtherapeutic at 1.2, indicating inadequate anticoagulation. Heparin IV gtt has been started, and warfarin will be held today due to an upcoming gastrointestinal procedure.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's recent venous blood gas (VBG) suggests metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. Her bicarbonate level remains low at 12 mEq/L. Sodium bicarbonate will be administered to correct the acidosis after addressing her hypocalcemia"

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped to 18 and was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), resulting in a Hct of 24. The patient has been kept NPO (nothing by mouth) since midnight and the heparin infusion was stopped at 5am. A gastrointestinal (GI) scope is planned for the morning, and the patient will receive desmopressin (DDAVP) before the procedure. The patient has allergies to penicillins and Percocet (oral oxycodone Hcl/acetaminophen), causing a rash.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/119 mmHg to 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,018 mL and output of 1,100 mL, with a total fluid balance of +918 mL.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 106 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 6.6 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (B"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions including anemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and venous thrombosis. She is currently on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and is also receiving intravenous (IV) fluids and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which could potentially be due to an infection such as Clostridium difficile colitis or viral gastroenteritis. Additionally, stool samples have been acquired for infectious workup.
2. Ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain could also be attributed to ischemia caused by microthrombosis, malignant hypertension, or SLE vasculitis.
3. SLE Flare-up: Given the patient's history of SLE, her current symptoms could indicate a flare-up of the disease, which may manifest as gastrointestinal involvement.
4. Thrombotic Events: The patient has a history of multiple thrombotic events, and there is a concern for further thrombotic complications, especially since she is on warfarin therapy.
5. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's uncontrolled blood pressure could lead to hypertensive urgency or even emergency if not managed promptly.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a recent history of metabolic acidosis, which requires correction with bicarbonate supplementation.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia can be attributed to several factors including gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
8. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium levels need to be corrected with appropriate supplementation.
9. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient's inability to tolerate CPAP suggests underlying OSA, which may require further evaluation and management.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple complications including anemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. She is currently undergoing treatment for these conditions and is awaiting further tests and procedures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain and positive guaiac-positive stool suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to various causes such as infection, ischemia, or inflammation.
2. Thrombotic Events: Given the patient's history of multiple thrombotic events, there is a risk of further thrombosis, which could lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
3. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's elevated blood pressure readings indicate uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to hypertensive crisis if not managed promptly.
4. Infection: The patient's symptoms of fever, leukocytosis, and positive stool culture suggest the possibility of infection, particularly Clostridium difficile colitis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated if necessary.
5. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a chief complaint of hypertension and abdominal pain. She has been unable to tolerate oral medications and is currently receiving IV medications. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/72 mmHg to 242/134 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium, as well as elevated white blood cell count. The patient's physical examination reveals no focal neurologic deficits, distended abdomen, and clear HEENT exam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure readings are significantly elevated, indicating a hypertensive urgency. If left untreated, this can lead to end-organ damage.
2. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain, along with her inability to tolerate oral medications, raises concerns for a possible gastrointestinal bleed. Further investigation, such as an EGD push enteroscopy, is recommended to evaluate for this possibility.
3. Ischemic bowel: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may indicate an ischemic bowel, which is a serious condition"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is admitted with hypertension and abdominal pain. They have received IV labetalol, were made NPO after midnight, and planned for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). They also received D5W with bicarbonate and one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient has allergies to penicillins and Percocet (oxycodone Hcl/acetaminophen), which causes itching. The last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole on 10/17/2141 at 8:00 PM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/72 mmHg to 242/134 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,018 mL and output of 1,100 mL.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 102 K/uL, platelet count of 90 mg/dL, sodium of 7.9 mg/dL, potassium of 17 mEq/L, chloride of 107 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 39 mg/dL, BUN of 137 mEq/L, glucose of 23.4%, calcium of 2.9 K/uL, magnesium of 39 mg/dL, and phosphorus of 6.8 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently high, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. This could lead to complications such as organ damage or failure.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function. This could be due to hypotension or other underlying conditions.

3. Infection: The patient's leukocyte count is slightly elevated, which may indicate an infection. Additionally, the presence of prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP suggests a risk for infections in the ICU.

4. Fluid overload: The fluid balance shows an intake exceeding the output, indicating a potential fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema or heart failure.

5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's sodium, potassium, and chloride levels are abnormal. These imbalances can affect various bodily functions and require careful management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a chief complaint of hypertension and abdominal pain. She has been unable to take her oral medications and is experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's vital signs show high blood pressure, but other parameters are within normal range. The patient has been on IV medications and fluids, including labetalol for hypertension, D5W with bicarb, and morphine sulfate for pain. She has received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient has a history of lupus and is currently being treated with prednisone. She also has known obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, which can lead to complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy, heart failure, or renal damage if not managed properly.
2. Ischemic vs. infectious etiology: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be due to an infectious or ischemic cause. Further evaluation through procedures like enteroscopy and biopsy will help determine the underlying cause.
3. Anemia: The patient's HCT levels are lower than baseline, indicating possible anemia. Monitoring and management of anemia should be considered.
4. Venous thromboses: As the patient is unable to take oral medications, she is at risk for developing venous thromboses, such as deep vein"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with hypertensive urgency, likely caused by her inability to take oral medications. She has also been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient underwent an endoscopy and was found to have normal appearing small bowel on follow-up path. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/74mmHg. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a central venous line placed. Her laboratory results show anemia and elevated liver enzymes. She is being treated with morphine for pain control and prednisone for suspected lupus. Heparin has been initiated for venous thromboses, and she will need follow-up for pulmonary hypertension. The patient's nutritional needs are being met with a renal diet, and her blood glucose levels are being monitored. She is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's inability to take oral medications may contribute to elevated blood pressure levels. It is important to monitor her blood pressure closely and adjust medications accordingly.

2. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea: Ischemic bowel disease should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment.

3. Anemia: The patient's low"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with hypertension urgency and underwent an endoscopy procedure. They experienced a transient episode of uncontrolled blood pressure after the procedure, but it was managed with intravenous hydralazine and oral medications. The patient's allergies include penicillins and Percocet, causing a rash. They have been receiving heparin sodium infusions and other ICU medications. The patient's medical, social, and family history remain unchanged, except for the noted allergies and recent events. Review of systems is unchanged from admission.

Vital signs show stable blood pressure within the normal range, with a heart rate of 88 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Neurological examination is also not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Kidney function appears to be impaired with elevated creatinine levels. Liver function tests are within normal limits, but there are elevated levels of amylase and lipase. Electrolyte levels are mostly within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. Cardiac biomarkers are within normal limits.

The patient's blood glucose levels have been stable and within normal range. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and various electrolytes,"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo F with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx two weeks ago),
   malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events (on
   warfarin) presented with N/V/D, abd pain, and hypertensive urgency, now
   re-transferred to the ICU for malignant hypertension.
   .
   # Hypertensive urgency: Currently resolved. Pt
s SBP had decreased to
   120
s during day on [**10-18**] without labetalol gtt. Pt did spike to as high
   as 260 on the floor after callout, but by the time of my exam pt is
   140/80. Likely did not wait long enogh for floor meds to take effect.
   Other contributors to hypertension include volume overload due to lack
   of recent dialysis, uncontrolled pain/nausea leading to sympathetic
   release, med non-compliance/cheeking

   # Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea/Abd Pain: Abd pain was improved with
   Morphine.  DDx includes infection/gastroenteritis, ischemia from
   microthrombosis, malignant HTN, SLE vasculitis/SLE enteritis, and
   pancreatitis (especially PD induced)
   -- continue morphine per previous dosing, 4-8mg IV q6PRN.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She was started on peritoneal dialysis (PD) about two weeks ago.

The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypertensive urgency. She was re-transferred to the ICU for malignant hypertension. Her blood pressure has been managed with medications including aliskiren, hydralazine, nifedipine, and clonidine orally. The blood pressure goal is to keep the systolic below 160.

The patient also has symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The pain has been controlled with morphine. Differential diagnoses include infection, ischemia from microthrombosis, malignant hypertension, SLE vasculitis/SLE enteritis, and pancreatitis (especially PD-induced). Stool studies have ruled out Clostridium difficile infection. Rheumatology/SLE studies, liver function tests, and amylase levels should be followed up.

The patient has ESRD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 8 mL/min. PD will continue when possible per renal recommendations, and calcitriol will be continued.

The patient has anemia, likely due to occult gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, or chronic"

   ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
   pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional
   left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
   function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is a
   mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. A mid-cavitary
   gradient is identified with cavity obliteration during systole. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
   regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
   velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
   hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
   The effusion appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic
   signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent
   in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-9-21**], the
   pericardial effusion has increased in size with the most accumulation
   posterior to the LV.
   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo F with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx two weeks ago),
   malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events (on
   warfarin) presented with N/V/D, abd pain, and hypertensive urgency, now
   re-transferred to the ICU for malignant hypertension.
   .
   # Hypertensive urgency: Pt has had issues with consistently taking her
   BP meds. When she does, it appears that her pressures are appropriately
   controlled.  Pain may be contributing to her HTN. Her abd pain has been
   improving.
   -- continue home regimen of aliskerin, hydralazine, nifedipine and
   clonidine PO
   -- 1:1 nursing observation of po med therapy
   -- prn Labetalol gtt with SBP goal of <160, unlikely to need this
   -- PD today
   -- pain and nausea control as below
   .
   # Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea/Abd Pain: Abd pain has generally improved,
   and pt now comfortably. Pain responds well to Morphine.  DDx includes
   infection/gastroenteritis, ischemia from microthrombosis, malignant
   HTN, SLE vasculitis/SLE enteritis, and pancreatitis (especially PD
   induced). Her pain is associated with her PD session. Stool studies
   negative. Rheum consult does not think SLE is cause of abd pain. CT-abd
   showed no signs of ischemic bowel and EGD showed only some esophagitis.
   -- continue morphine per previous dosing, 4-8mg IV q6PRN.
   -- trendre-check LFTs and amylase
   .
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.
   -- continue PD when possible per renal
   -- Continue Calcitriol
   .
   # Anemia:  s/p 1unit pRBCs in ICU with appropriate bump (baseline in
   low-mid 20s). Etiologies include occult GI bleed (guaiac pos stool, abd
   pain), hemolysis, ACD [**2-11**] CRF. EGD showed erosion at the GE junction.
   -- s/p SB Enteroscopy without obvious source
   -- [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   -- epogen per renal recs
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Improved s/p recent NaHCO3 infusion per renal
   recs. Recent VBG suggests Metabolic Acidosis with respiratory
   compensation.
   -- renal recs
   -- trend HCO3, repeat VBG
   .
   # H/O Venous Thrombosis: warfarin 2mg qd at home. INR 1.2 on arrival,
   last INR 1.4
   -- trend INR
   -- Coumadin 2mg today
   .
   # SLE:  Possible etiology of GI symptoms includes vasculitis though
   rheum does not think her GI issues are [**2-11**] to lupus.
   -- f/u SLE studies.
   -- Appreciate Rheum c/s.
   -- cont. prednisone 4mg home dose

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient has a history of malignant hypertension and is currently experiencing high blood pressure. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.

2. Infection: The patient is undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), which increases the risk of infections. Infections can occur in the PD catheter, abdomen, or other parts of the body. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, abdominal pain, or changes in vital signs, is important.

3. Gastrointestinal (GI) issues: The patient has symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms could be caused by various conditions, including infection, ischemia from microthrombosis, malignant hypertension, SLE vasculitis/SLE enteritis, or pancreatitis. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the exact cause and provide appropriate treatment.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. This may be due to occult GI bleeding, hemolysis, or chronic kidney disease. It is essential to identify the underlying cause and treat it accordingly to address the anemia.

5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypertension (HTN). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications, including Heparin Sodium, Morphine Sulfate, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112-125/66-81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, fluctuating between 36.3 and 36.7 degrees Celsius.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and lactate, as well as slightly low levels of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). Other lab values, including white blood cell count (WBC), glucose, electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), kidney function tests (KFTs), and cardiac markers, are mostly within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. Imaging studies, such as an ultrasound and cardiac echo, have been performed but no specific findings are mentioned in the progress note.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being managed in the ICU with close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Summary of Information:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a chief complaint of hypertension. She has a history of penicillin allergy and takes oral medications for her condition. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypertensive urgency, likely caused by her inability to take her oral medications. She also presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient has anemia and requires a blood transfusion. She is also experiencing pain and is on morphine IV for pain management. Additionally, the patient has a history of lupus and is being treated with prednisone. She is currently receiving heparin for venous thromboses and will require follow-up for pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: If not properly managed, the patient may develop complications related to high blood pressure such as cardiac issues, stroke, or kidney damage.
2. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea: These symptoms could indicate an underlying gastrointestinal issue, possibly ischemic bowel disease. If left untreated, it could lead to severe complications like bowel perforation or necrosis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be monitored closely, and appropriate management should be implemented to prevent further complications.
4. Pain: The patient is on morphine IV for pain control, but long-term use of opioids can lead to dependency and other complications.
5. Lupus: The patient's lupus should be carefully managed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman admitted with hypertensive urgency, likely due to her inability to take her oral medications. She also has symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 112 to 125 mmHg over the past 24 hours. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her respiratory rate is within normal limits. The patient has a history of lupus, for which she is receiving prednisone treatment. She is currently on heparin for venous thromboses and morphine IV for pain control. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia and elevated liver enzymes. She has been on peritoneal dialysis since admission. The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were evaluated with an EGD push enteroscopy, which showed a normal appearing small bowel. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary hypertension, for which follow-up is recommended. The patient is on a renal diet and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
2. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea: These symptoms may indicate an underlying gastrointestinal issue. If left untreated, it could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx two weeks
   ago), malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events
   (on warfarin) who initially presented with abdominal pain and nausea
   and has been sent back to the MICU with hypertensive urgency.
   # Hypertensive urgency:
   Currently resolved.  Pt
s SBP had decreased to 120s during day on [**10-18**]
   without labetalol gtt.  Pt did spike to as high as 260 on the floor
   after callout, but upon admission to MICU, BP is 127/68 (I confirmed
   manually at 138/70).  Likely did not wait long enogh for floor meds to
   take effect.  Other contributors to hypertension include volume load
   with peritoneal dialysis, abdominal pain, and medication
   non-compliance.
   -- continue home regimen of aliskerin, hydralazine, nifedipine and
   clonidine PO
   -- continue nifedipine, appears to work very well for her
   -- 1:1 nursing observation of po med therapy
   -- prn Labetalol gtt with SBP goal of <160, unlikely to need this
   -- PD today
   -- pain and nausea control as below
   # Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea/Abd Pain:
   Abd pain continues to be of unclear etiology.  Lactates have been
   normal and infectious work-up negative.  Small bowel enteroscopy not
   revealing, although final pathology still pending.
   -- continue morphine per previous dosing, 4-8mg IV q6PRN.
   -- f/u pathology report
   -- heparin gtt for treatment of ? thrombotic ischemia; resume warfarin
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.
   -- continue PD when possible per renal
   -- patient will likely need HD as she may not be getting sufficient
   dialysis with PD
   -- Continue Calcitriol
   -- appreciate renal recs
   # Anemia:  s/p 1unit pRBCs in ICU with appropriate bump (baseline in
   low-mid 20s). Etiologies include occult GI bleed (guaiac pos stool, abd
   pain), hemolysis, ACD [**2-11**] CRF.
   -- s/p SB Enteroscopy without obvious source
   -- daily Hct; active type and screen
   -- epogen per renal recs
   # Metabolic Acidosis:
   Appears to have chronic anion gap metabolic acidosis.  No evidence of
   elevated lactate.  ? whether this could be due to chronic kidney
   disease with underdialysis because of poor ability to tolerate PD.
   -- renal recs
   -- trend HCO3
   # H/O Venous Thrombosis: warfarin 2mg qd at home; has been
   subtherapeutic in hospital
   -- Heparin IV gtt now, warfarin resumed
   -- trend INR
   # SLE:
   -- continue prednisone 4mg home dose
   # OSA: pt unable to tolerate CPAP, not an active inpatient issue.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, a history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She was initially admitted with abdominal pain and nausea and has now been sent back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypertensive urgency. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 179/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals a pleasant, alert patient sitting up in bed without distress. The patient has a prosthetic eye and an abnormal systolic murmur. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and other abnormalities, indicating kidney dysfunction. The patient is on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and warfarin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, indicating ongoing hypertension. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. ESRD: The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 8 mL/min, indicating severe kidney dysfunction. This puts the patient at risk for further complications related to fluid and electrolyte imbalance, acid-base disturbances, and anemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx two weeks
   ago), malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events
   (on warfarin) who initially presented with abdominal pain and nausea
   and has been sent back to the MICU with hypertensive urgency.
   # Hypertensive urgency:
   Currently resolved.  Pt
s SBP had decreased to 120s during day on [**10-18**]
   without labetalol gtt.  Pt did spike to as high as 260 on the floor
   after callout, but upon admission to MICU, BP is 127/68 (I confirmed
   manually at 138/70).  Likely did not wait long enogh for floor meds to
   take effect.  Other contributors to hypertension include volume load
   with peritoneal dialysis, abdominal pain, and medication
   non-compliance.
   -- continue home regimen of aliskerin, hydralazine, nifedipine and
   clonidine PO
   -- continue nifedipine, appears to work very well for her
   -- 1:1 nursing observation of po med therapy
   -- prn Labetalol gtt with SBP goal of <160, unlikely to need this
   -- PD today
   -- pain and nausea control as below
   # Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea/Abd Pain:
   Abd pain continues to be of unclear etiology.  Lactates have been
   normal and infectious work-up negative.  Small bowel enteroscopy not
   revealing, although final pathology still pending.
   -- continue morphine per previous dosing, 4-8mg IV q6PRN.
   -- f/u pathology report
   -- heparin gtt for treatment of ? thrombotic ischemia; resume warfarin
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.
   -- continue PD when possible per renal
   -- patient will likely need HD as she may not be getting sufficient
   dialysis with PD
   -- Continue Calcitriol
   -- appreciate renal recs
   # Anemia:  s/p 1unit pRBCs in ICU with appropriate bump (baseline in
   low-mid 20s). Etiologies include occult GI bleed (guaiac pos stool, abd
   pain), hemolysis, ACD [**2-11**] CRF.
   -- s/p SB Enteroscopy without obvious source
   -- daily Hct; active type and screen
   -- epogen per renal recs
   # Metabolic Acidosis:
   Appears to have chronic anion gap metabolic acidosis.  No evidence of
   elevated lactate.  ? whether this could be due to chronic kidney
   disease with underdialysis because of poor ability to tolerate PD.
   -- renal recs
   -- trend HCO3
   # H/O Venous Thrombosis: warfarin 2mg qd at home; has been
   subtherapeutic in hospital
   -- Heparin IV gtt now, warfarin resumed
   -- trend INR
   # SLE:
   -- continue prednisone 4mg home dose
   # OSA: pt unable to tolerate CPAP, not an active inpatient issue.
   -- F/u with outside PCP for OSA [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u.
   # FEN:
   -- Regular diet. IVF to KVO. Replete lytes prn.
   # ACCESS:
   -- PD cath, PIVx1, mid-line
   # PPx:
   -- Heparin gtt.
   # CODE:
   -- FULL
   # COMMUNICATION:
   -- patient, mother [**Name (NI) 4948**] [**Name (NI) **] (works at [**Hospital1 54**]).
   # Dispo
   -- ICU for now, but likely c/o to floor if BPs remain stable

   On this day I examined and was present for the key portions of the
   services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5951**]
s note above and agree
   with the findings and plan of care.  I would add that over the past 8
   hrs there has been substantial improvement in BP control, though with
   abdominal pain (which seems at least in part related to her PD)
   [**Known firstname 4965**]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] can rise sharply.  Unfortunately neither Dilaudid nor
   Morphine orally seem to help her pain.  We will thus try low dose
   fentanyl patch as well as increasing her lopressor, to get even better
   BP control.   Overall she looks and feels well, and will be transferred
   to the floor later today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, a history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She initially presented with abdominal pain and nausea and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypertensive urgency. Her current medications include nifedipine CR 120mg PO daily, Toprol XL 200mg PO daily, hydralazine 50mg PO TID, clonidine patch, and aliskiren 300mg PO daily. She also has a fentanyl patch for pain control and will receive an extra dose of Toprol XL 100mg PO daily, increasing to 300mg tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency/Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite medication adjustments. There is a risk of end-organ damage if not controlled promptly.

2. Abdominal Pain: The cause of the abdominal pain is unclear, and further investigation is needed. Potential causes include peritonitis, bowel ischemia, or other intra-abdominal conditions.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD, and her estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 8mL/min. She is currently on peritoneal dialysis (PD), but may require hemodial"

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx three weeks
   ago), malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events
   (on warfarin) who initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and
   nausea and has been sent back to the MICU with hypertensive urgency.
   # Hypertensive urgency:  Uncontrolled BP overnight with SBP max 260
   for 24 hrs, appears to be associated with PD and abdominal pain. Pt
   responded to labetalol gtt and nifedipime, labetalol gtt currently
   held. Increased toprol XL from 200mg to 300mg PO qday yesterday.
   -- Will d/w Renal (emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3006**] regarding adding additional BP
   medications and past trials of anti-hypertensives. Considering
   minoxidil, ACE inhibitors, and increase in nifedipime.
   -- Considering Renal U/S. Will d/w Renal
   -- Anti-hypertensives now consist of: Nifedipime CR 120mg PO Daily,
   Toprol XL 300mg PO Daily, Hydralazine 50mg PO TID, Clonidine Patch,
   Aliskiren 300mg PO Daily.
   -- 1:1 nursing observation of po med therapy
   -- prn Labetalol gtt with SBP goal of <160
   -- PD today per renal
   -- pain and nausea control as below
   # Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea/Abd Pain:  Abd pain continues to be of
   unclear etiology.  Lactates have been normal and infectious work-up
   negative.  Small bowel enteroscopy negative for abnormal findings.
   Sexual history taken (listed above).
   -- Currently has Fentanyl Patch to provide better baseline pain
   -- Start Morphine Sulfate IR 30-45 mg PO Q6H:PRN; standing order for
   Morphine 2-4mg IV q4PRN.
   -- Consider further Gyn work-up given abdominal pain etiology continues
   to remain unclear (h/o vaginal bleeding and pain related to
cysts
 per
   patient).
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.
   -- continue PD when possible per renal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypertensive urgency and abdominal pain.

The patient's medical history and current conditions pose several potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure has been uncontrolled overnight with a maximum systolic blood pressure of 260 mmHg. This is a serious concern as it can lead to end-organ damage and requires immediate medical intervention.

2. Malignant hypertension: The patient has a history of malignant hypertension, which is a severe form of high blood pressure that can rapidly progress to hypertensive emergency if not managed properly. It can cause damage to vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, and brain.

3. ESRD: The patient has ESRD due to SLE, which requires renal replacement therapy. She is currently undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), but may require hemodialysis (HD) due to insufficient dialysis with PD.

4. SLE: The patient has a history of SLE, an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and systems in the body. It can cause various complications, including renal involvement, cardiovascular problems, and increased risk of infections.

   24yo woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx two weeks
   ago), malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events
   (on warfarin) who initially presented with abdominal pain and nausea
   and has been sent back to the MICU with hypertensive urgency.
   # Hypertensive urgency:  Improved BP control overnight with SBP max
   190s for 24 hrs, and 160s overnight. Asymptomatic.
   -- Anti-hypertensives now consist of: Nifedipime CR 120mg PO Daily,
   Toprol XL 200mg PO Daily, Hydralazine 50mg PO TID, Clonidine Patch,
   Aliskiren 300mg PO Daily.
   -- Will provide extra dose of Toprol XL 100 mg PO Daily, and start
   Toprol XL 300mg tomorrow
   -- continue home regimen of aliskerin, hydralazine, nifedipine and
   clonidine PO
   -- 1:1 nursing observation of po med therapy
   -- prn Labetalol gtt with SBP goal of <160, unlikely to need this
   -- PD today
   -- pain and nausea control as below
   # Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea/Abd Pain: Controlled overnight.  Abd pain
   continues to be of unclear etiology.  Lactates have been normal and
   infectious work-up negative.  Small bowel enteroscopy not revealing,
   although final pathology still pending.  Sexual history taken (listed
   above)
   -- Will dose pt for Fentanyl Patch to provide better baseline pain
   control
   -- Continue morphine per previous dosing, 2-4mg IV q4PRN.
   -- Consider further Gyn work-up given abdominal pain etiology continues
   to remain unclear
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.
   -- continue PD when possible per renal
   -- patient will likely need HD as she may not be getting sufficient
   dialysis with PD
   -- Continue Calcitriol
   -- appreciate renal recs
   # Anemia:  Hct Stable at 27.3

She was initially admitted with abdominal pain and nausea and has now been sent back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with hypertensive urgency.

The patient's current medical complications and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, reaching levels in the 190s and 160s. This is a concern as it can lead to organ damage if not managed properly. The patient is currently on multiple anti-hypertensive medications, including nifedipine CR, topranolol XL, hydralazine, clonidine patch, and aliskiren.

2. Abdominal pain: The patient initially presented with abdominal pain, which continues to be of unclear etiology. Infectious work-up has been negative, and small bowel enteroscopy did not reveal any findings. The cause of the abdominal pain needs further investigation, and a gynecological work-up is being considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient has a history of hypertension and allergies to penicillins and Percocet. Over the past 24 hours, the patient experienced episodes of high blood pressure, for which hydralazine, labetalol, and nifedipine were given. The patient also had an episode of nausea and vomiting during peritoneal dialysis, for which zofran was administered. The patient completed four cycles of peritoneal dialysis but did not complete the final cycle due to abdominal discomfort. The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/65 mmHg to 256/147 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he is receiving respiratory support.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels have been consistently elevated, ranging from 7.0-8.3 mg/dL. Blood glucose levels have been relatively stable, ranging from 84-118 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), amylase, lipase, and lactate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 24-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events.
- She presented initially with abdominal pain and nausea and has been admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with hypertensive urgency.
- Her current medications include nifedipine CR 120mg PO daily, toprol XL 200mg PO daily, hydralazine 50mg PO TID, clonidine patch, aliskiren 300mg PO daily, and warfarin 2mg qd at home.
- The patient's blood pressure has been controlled overnight, with a maximum systolic blood pressure of 260mmHg.
- She continues to experience abdominal pain of unclear etiology, despite negative infectious work-up and small bowel enteroscopy.
- Fentanyl patch and morphine IV q4PRN have been prescribed for pain management.
- Further gynecological work-up is being considered given the patient's history of vaginal bleeding and pain related to ovarian cysts.
- The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 8mL/min, and she will likely require hemodialysis (HD) in addition to peritoneal dialysis (PD).
- Anemia management includes daily Hct monitoring, active type and screen"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea and was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypertensive urgency. 

The patient responded to labetalol gtt and nifedipine for hypertension but her blood pressure remains uncontrolled. She is currently on a combination of anti-hypertensive medications including nifedipine CR, toprol XL, hydralazine, clonidine patch, and aliskiren. 

Further evaluation is planned, including a renal ultrasound and consultation with a nephrologist to optimize her anti-hypertensive regimen. 

The patient's abdominal pain continues to be of unclear etiology, with negative infectious work-up and small bowel enteroscopy. A sexual history was taken due to the patient's history of vaginal bleeding and pain related to ovarian cysts.

The patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 8 mL/min, indicating severe renal impairment. She is currently undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), but may require hemodialysis (HD) as she may not be receiving sufficient dialysis with PD.

Her hemoglobin concentration is stable at 26.9%, and she will receive"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note above and agree
   with the findings and plan of care.  I would add the following:
   Ms [**Known lastname 406**] continues to have very wide swings in BP with frankly still
malignantly
 elevate BP
s at times.  These seem to be more in the
   evening and perhaps more when her PD fluid is dwelling.  We will
   discuss with renal today her HTN so that we can come to a concerted
   plan, and what new meds to consider (?minoxidil).
   We will try reverting to morphine orally, but in higher dose, hoping to
   better control her pain.
   She is snoring today, even when awake.  Despite her claustrophobia, she
   needs to try CPAP again, initially for very short intervals, to get
   used to the mask.

   (on warfarin) who initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and
   nausea and hypertensive urgency.
   # Hypertensive urgency:  Uncontrolled BP overnight with SBP max 190
   usually her HTN is associated with PD and abdominal pain. Pt responded
   to labetalol gtt, labetalol gtt currently off.
   -- D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3006**] regarding outpatient oral hydralazine sliding
   scale; will consider sliding scale. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3006**] will visit today for
   additional input.
   -- Considering Renal U/S although, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3006**], suspicion is low.
   -- Anti-hypertensives now consist of: Nifedipime CR 120mg PO Daily,
   Toprol XL 300mg PO Daily, Hydralazine 50mg PO TID, Clonidine Patch,
   Aliskiren 300mg PO Daily.
   -- 1:1 nursing observation of po med therapy

   #Chest Pain: Currently no pain and hemodynamically stable. No changes
   on serial EKGs, initial enzymes negative. In setting of gastroccult pos
   emesis before pain. Pt given GI cocktail with relief from pain. Most
   likely etiology includes GERD and PUD with possible bleeding ulcer,
   however, still considering Angina or ACS (given risk factors).
   -Continue to rule out ACS with serial enzymes
   -Consider increasing pantoprozole 40mg PO qday to [**Hospital1 **]
   #Emesis: Continued to have occult pos emesis yesterday, hemodynamically
   stable, UGIB considered and warfarin held. Etiologies include PUD with
   active bleeding, gastritis, [**Doctor First Name 1856**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear, esophageal erosion,
   pancreatitis.
   --- Will continue to follow HCT and vital signs to monitor for UGIB.
   n        Will d/w GI regarding possible EGD if HCT drops
   --- Consider increase in ppi as listed above
   # Nausea/Diarrhea/Abd Pain:  Lower abd pain continues to be of unclear
   etiology.  Lactates have been normal and infectious work-up negative.
   Small bowel enteroscopy negative for abnormal findings. Working
   diagnosis include microthrombic small bowel ischemia, ovarian cyst.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and hypertensive urgency.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment with labetalol. The goal is to maintain the systolic blood pressure below 160. The patient is on a combination of medications including nifedipine CR, toprol XL, hydralazine, clonidine patch, and aliskiren. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive therapy are necessary.

2. Chest pain: The patient experienced chest pain, which was relieved with a GI cocktail. Possible etiologies include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), angina, or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Serial cardiac enzymes are being monitored to rule out ACS.

3. Emesis: The patient continues to have occult positive emesis, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Etiologies include PUD with active bleeding, gastritis, Mallory-Weiss tear, esophageal erosion, or pancreatitis. The patient's hemodynamic stability should be closely monitored, and"

   PGY2 addendum:
   Agree with MSIV assessment/plan as detailed above.  Briefly, 24F with
   SLE, ESRD on PD, HTN, SVC syndrome; admit with abdominal pain and HTN
   urgency.  Current issues include Hct drop and concern for active UGIB
   with ?hematemesis yesterday.  GI aware, plan for scope in AM if
   continues to be stable.  Minimal PO/NPO today.   [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  Transfuse 2
   units and recheck this evening.  BP currently in 120s on above regimen,
   ?lower due to GI bleeding.  Continue antihypertensives (may switch to
   home regimen); consider increasing PD fluid concentration to get more
   fluid off (6L positive LOS).  Retrial of CPAP if tolerated.  Will
   monitor in MICU for now
 watching BP and hematocrits.
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to SLE, malignant hypertension, and previous superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx three weeks
   ago), malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events
   (on warfarin) who initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and
   nausea and hypertensive urgency
   #Anemia: HCT 26
20 O/N in setting of hematemesis and epigastric pain.
   Etiologies including UGIB from PUD or gastritis (given history of
   chronic prednisone use, previous CT findings of gastric wall edema, and
   possible uremic bleeding) or possible LGIB from ischemia (although
   negative stool guaiac, negative lactates); 1 PIV-20gauge placed in
   addition to midline; 2units pRBC ordered for transfusion; d/w GI, no
   scope for now as patient ate this am. Hemodynamically stable (not
   tachycardic) now although possible relative decreased BP.
   -F/u GI for formal recs with re to possible scope tomorrow. EGD vs
   colonoscopy? If colonoscopy, need prep.
   -NPO for now
   -Repeat HCT at 5pm after 2units of pRBCs; transfuse to keep HCT >25.
   -Epogen MWF
   # Hypertensive urgency:  Uncontrolled BP overnight with SBP max 190
   usually her HTN is associated with PD and abdominal pain. Pt responded
   to labetalol gtt, labetalol gtt currently off; Nifedipine given early.
   Current low BP possibly secondary to medication or decreased
   intravascular blood volume secondary to GIB. Current BP meds:
   Nifedipime CR 120mg PO Daily, Toprol XL 300mg PO Daily, Hydralazine
   50mg PO TID, Clonidine Patch, Aliskiren 300mg PO Daily.
   -- D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3006**] regarding outpatient oral hydralazine sliding scale
   (SS: If SBP>170, take 25 mg po hydralazine as needed, every 20 minutes,
   until her bps improve improves.)
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5991**],  Will switch patient back to all home
   antihypertensive medications: nifedipine SR 60mg qday, labetalol 900mg
   TID, hydralazine 50mg q8hr (will write for scale), clonidine 0.3mg/24hr
   patch qwed, aliskiren 150mg [**Hospital1 **].
   -- 1:1 nursing observation of po med therapy
   -- PD x4 each day: Will increase PD fill volume to 1.25.
   -- pain and nausea control as below
   #Chest Pain: Currently no pain and hemodynamically stable. No changes
   on serial EKGs, initial enzymes negative. In setting of gastroccult pos
   emesis before pain. Pt given GI cocktail with relief from pain. Most
   likely etiology includes GERD and PUD with possible bleeding ulcer,
   however, still considering Angina or ACS (given risk factors).
   -Continue to rule out ACS with serial enzymes
   -Consider increasing pantoprozole 40mg PO qday to [**Hospital1 **]
   # Nausea/Diarrhea/Abd Pain:  Lower abd pain continues to be of unclear
   etiology.  Lactates have been normal and infectious work-up negative.
   Small bowel enteroscopy negative for abnormal findings. No new issues.
   -- Currently has MSIR 30-45 mg PO Q6H:PRN; standing order for Morphine
   2-4mg IV q4PRN.
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  s/p PDx4 yesterday. Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.
   -- continue PD per renal recs as above.
   -- patient will likely need HD as she may not be getting sufficient
   dialysis with PD; however, still refuses HD.
   -- appreciate renal recs
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Chronic anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Bicarb of
   23 now.
   -- renal recs
   -- trend HCO3
   #hypocalcemia: Currently, calcium improved at 7.9 although still low.
   Anticipate decrease Ca with transfusion
   -Will check Calcium daily and provide calcium gluconate 4mg IV PRN
   -Continue calcitriol
   # H/O Venous Thrombosis: INR now subtherapeutic at 1.9. Held coumadin
   yesterday and today with re to possible UGIB.
   -- Hold Coumadin until HCT stabilizes/post-GI scope
   -- D/C Heparin IV gtt
   -- trend INR
   # SLE:
   -- Cont prednisone 4mg home dose
   # OSA: pt unable to tolerate CPAP secondary to claustrophobia.
   Hypertensive episodes may be related to OSA.
   -- Will have respiratory therapy visit patient today and encourage
   small trials of CPAP to get patient used to mask.
   # FEN:
   -- NPO for possible GI scope. IVF to KVO. Replete lytes prn.
   # ACCESS:
   -- PD cath, PIV-20x1, mid-line on right
   # PPx: Coumadin,
   # CODE: FULL
   # COMMUNICATION: Patient, mother [**Name (NI) 4948**] [**Name (NI) **] (works at [**Hospital1 54**]).
   # Dispo: MICU for now to monitor BP and HCT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and hypertensive urgency.

Current Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia: HCT 26% due to hematemesis and epigastric pain. Possible etiologies include upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or gastritis, or lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) from ischemia. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is being monitored for hemodynamic stability.
2. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite medication. Labetalol was given initially, but its current status is unknown. Nifedipine has been started. The patient's current low blood pressure may be secondary to medication or decreased intravascular blood volume due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
3. Chest pain: The patient experienced chest pain last night, which was relieved with a GI cocktail. No changes on serial EKGs, and initial enzymes were negative. Possible etiologies include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and PUD with a possible bleeding ulcer. Angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is still being considered"

   nausea and has been sent back to the MICU with hypertensive urgency.
   # Hypertensive urgency:  Uncontrolled BP overnight with SBP max 260
   for 24 hrs, appears to be associated with PD and abdominal pain. Pt
   responded to labetalol gtt and nifedipime, labetalol gtt currently
   held. Increased toprol XL from 200mg to 300mg PO qday yesterday.

   -- Currently has Fentanyl Patch to provide better baseline pain
   -- Start Morphine Sulfate IR 30-45 mg PO Q6H:PRN; standing order for
   Morphine 2-4mg IV q4PRN.
   -- Consider further Gyn work-up given abdominal pain etiology continues
   to remain unclear (h/o vaginal bleeding and pain related to
cysts
 per
   patient).
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.
   -- continue PD when possible per renal

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, history of superior vena cava syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea and has been sent back to the MICU with hypertensive urgency. The patient's current condition includes uncontrolled blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She has been started on labetalol and nifedipine, with labetalol temporarily held. Topped XL dosage has been increased to 300mg per day. The plan is to consider adding additional antihypertensive medications and perform a renal ultrasound. The patient's ongoing issues include unclear abdominal pain etiology, anemia, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, history of venous thrombosis, and sleep apnea. She is currently on peritoneal dialysis and will likely need hemodialysis as well. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment, which can lead to organ damage if not controlled promptly.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's vomiting and abdominal pain could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which is a serious condition requiring immediate attention.

   24yo woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx three weeks
   ago), malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events
   (on warfarin) who initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and
   nausea and has been sent back to the MICU with hypertensive urgency.
   # Hypertensive urgency:  Uncontrolled BP overnight with SBP max 260
   for 24 hrs, appears to be associated with PD and abdominal pain. Pt
   responded to labetalol gtt and nifedipime, labetalol gtt currently
   held. Increased toprol XL from 200mg to 300mg PO qday yesterday.

   unclear etiology.  Lactates have been normal and infectious work-up
   negative.  Small bowel enteroscopy negative for abnormal findings.
   Sexual history taken (listed above).
   -- Currently has Fentanyl Patch to provide better baseline pain
   -- Start Morphine Sulfate IR 30-45 mg PO Q6H:PRN; standing order for
   Morphine 2-4mg IV q4PRN.
   -- Consider further Gyn work-up given abdominal pain etiology continues
   to remain unclear (h/o vaginal bleeding and pain related to
cysts
 per
   patient).
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.
   -- continue PD when possible per renal
   -- patient will likely need HD as she may not be getting sufficient
   dialysis with PD

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, a history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events. She initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea and has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypertensive urgency.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's uncontrolled blood pressure (SBP max 260 for 24 hours) is associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) and abdominal pain. She responded to labetalol and nifedipine but has had an increase in toprol XL. Further evaluation and management of her blood pressure is required.

2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain continues to be of unclear etiology. Infectious work-up has been negative, and small bowel enteroscopy did not reveal any abnormal findings. Further investigation and pain control measures are needed.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has chronic anion gap metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate level of 17. Renal recommendations should be followed, and bicarbonate levels should be trended.

4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is low at 7.4. Ionized calcium should be obtained, and calcium gluconate should be provided IV as needed. Calc"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypertensive urgency.
   HYPERTENSION -- challenging to treat, but improved on current regimen.
   Now off iv meds.  Tolerating longer acting agents, allowing
   consolidated regimen.  Suspect emesis likely contributes to challenges
   controlling BP with oral medications.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for GI bleed.  GI consulted, pending
   EGD.  Continue to monitor serial Hct, maintain >21.  Transfuse.
   s/p THROMBOTIC COMPLICATIONS -- s/p coumadin (holding).  Hope to resume
   once current GI evaluation complete.
   RENAL FAILURE -- currently with PD,but tolerating only intermittently
   (abd discomfort).  Only receiving total 16 hrs PD.  Hopefully can
   increase duration or percentage of dialysate to remove more fluid
   (consider alternating 2.5% and 4%).
   CHEST PAIN -- chest pain syndrome, unlikely caridac in origin.  Suspect
   related to GI tract such as reflux.
   ABD PAIN -- not surgical abd.  [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PD, but no evidence
   for peritonitis or PD catheter associated infection.
   SLE -- continue prednisone.
   OSA -- prior trial of CPAP --> poorly tolerated due to clostrophobia.
   Hope to resume trials with alternate forms of mask.  Control of OSA may
   improve control of HTN.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical issues. The patient has been diagnosed with hypertensive urgency, anemia, renal failure, chest pain, and abdominal pain. The patient's blood pressure has improved with the current regimen, but it remains challenging to control due to emesis. The patient's anemia is progressive, and there are concerns for gastrointestinal bleeding. Renal failure is present, and the patient is currently undergoing peritoneal dialysis but is only tolerating it intermittently. The cause of chest pain is suspected to be related to the gastrointestinal tract, possibly reflux. Abdominal pain is not believed to be surgical in nature. The patient also has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's condition requires ICU care, and they are currently receiving appropriate treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:
1. Uncontrolled hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure poses a risk for further complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The progressive anemia and concerns for GI bleed indicate a potential complication that could lead to hypotension and shock if not promptly addressed.
3. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's renal function is compromised, and if not managed properly, it could worsen, leading to further kidney damage or the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypertensive urgency.
   HYPERTENSION -- challenging to treat, but improved on current regimen.
   Now off iv meds.  Tolerating longer acting agents, allowing
   consolidated regimen.  Suspect emesis likely contributes to challenges
   controlling BP with oral medications.
   ANEMIA -- progressive.  Concern for GI bleed.  GI consulted, pending
   EGD.  Continue to monitor serial Hct, maintain >21.  Transfuse.
   s/p THROMBOTIC COMPLICATIONS -- s/p coumadin (holding).  Hope to resume
   once current GI evaluation complete.
   RENAL FAILURE -- currently with PD,but tolerating only intermittently
   (abd discomfort).  Only receiving total 16 hrs PD.  Hopefully can
   increase duration or percentage of dialysate to remove more fluid
   (consider alternating 2.5% and 4%).
   CHEST PAIN -- chest pain syndrome, unlikely caridac in origin.  Suspect
   related to GI tract such as reflux.
   ABD PAIN -- not surgical abd.  [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PD, but no evidence
   for peritonitis or PD catheter associated infection.
   SLE -- continue prednisone.
   OSA -- prior trial of CPAP --> poorly tolerated due to clostrophobia.
   Hope to resume trials with alternate forms of mask.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with hypertensive urgency and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has experienced episodes of chest discomfort associated with nausea, but ECG and Troponin levels were within normal limits. The patient's blood pressure has improved with the current regimen, and they are no longer on IV labetalol.

The patient is tolerating peritoneal dialysis reasonably well, although there is some discomfort. They are also tolerating longer-acting agents, allowing for a consolidated regimen. It is suspected that vomiting may contribute to the challenges in controlling blood pressure with oral medications.

The patient has progressive anemia, and there is concern for gastrointestinal bleeding. GI consultation has been requested, pending esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Serial hematocrit levels will be monitored, and the patient's hemoglobin will be maintained above 21%. Blood transfusion may be necessary.

The patient has had thrombotic complications in the past and is currently on Coumadin (warfarin). However, Coumadin is being held due to an upcoming gastrointestinal evaluation. It is hoped to resume Coumadin once the evaluation is complete.

The patient has renal failure and is currently undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). They are tolerating PD intermittently, with abdominal discomfort. Only 16 hours of PD have been tolerated so far. It is hoped to increase the duration or percentage of dialysate to remove more fluid, possibly by alternating between "

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), malignant hypertension, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented initially with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and hypertensive urgency. She is currently in the ICU for close monitoring of her blood pressure and hematocrit levels.

Current Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) was increased from 20% to 26% after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
2. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite starting a new antihypertensive regimen, including nicardipine, labetalol, hydralazine, clonidine, and aliskiren. The dose of hydralazine may be decreased if the blood pressure is well-controlled.
3. Fever: The patient has a fever with a maximum temperature of 102°F. Possible etiologies include infection (UTI, PNA, gastroenteritis), SLE, transfusion reaction, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Blood, urine, and PD cultures were sent, and further investigation is needed.
4. Chest pain: The patient experienced mild epigastric/midsternal pain last night, which was relieved by a GI cocktail"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of high blood pressure. The patient's medical history includes penicillin allergy and rash from Percocet. He is currently on several medications including pantoprazole and has had infusions of blood products. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 185/121 to 108/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels (8.3 on 10/24) suggest possible kidney dysfunction, potentially due to hypoperfusion or pre-existing kidney disease.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in sodium (116 mg/dL), potassium (4.7 mEq/L), and chloride (23 mEq/L) levels, which can affect various bodily functions and require correction.
4. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT and PTT, along with low fibrinogen level, suggest a bleeding tendency that needs to be managed appropriately.
5. Infection:"

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo woman with ESRD secondary to SLE (started PD approx three weeks
   ago), malignant HTN, h/o SVC syndrome, and multiple thrombotic events
   (on warfarin) who initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and
   nausea and hypertensive urgency
   #Anemia: HCT 26
20 O/N in setting of hematemesis and epigastric pain.
   Etiologies including UGIB from PUD or gastritis (given history of
   chronic prednisone use, previous CT findings of gastric wall edema, and
   possible uremic bleeding) or possible LGIB from ischemia (although
   negative stool guaiac, negative lactates); 1 PIV-20gauge placed in
   addition to midline; 2units pRBC ordered for transfusion; d/w GI, no
   scope for now as patient ate this am. Hemodynamically stable (not
   tachycardic) now although possible relative decreased BP.
   -F/u GI for formal recs with re to possible scope tomorrow. EGD vs
   colonoscopy? If colonoscopy, need prep.
   -NPO for now
   -Repeat HCT at 5pm after 2units of pRBCs; transfuse to keep HCT >25.
   -Epogen MWF
   # Hypertensive urgency:  Uncontrolled BP overnight with SBP max 190
   usually her HTN is associated with PD and abdominal pain. Pt responded
   to labetalol gtt, labetalol gtt currently off; Nifedipine given early.
   Current low BP possibly secondary to medication or decreased
   intravascular blood volume secondary to GIB. Current BP meds:
   Nifedipime CR 120mg PO Daily, Toprol XL 300mg PO Daily, Hydralazine
   50mg PO TID, Clonidine Patch, Aliskiren 300mg PO Daily.
   -- D/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3006**] regarding outpatient oral hydralazine sliding scale
   (SS: If SBP>170, take 25 mg po hydralazine as needed, every 20 minutes,
   until her bps improve improves.)
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5991**],  Will switch patient back to all home
   antihypertensive medications: nifedipine SR 60mg qday, labetalol 900mg
   TID, hydralazine 50mg q8hr (will write for scale), clonidine 0.3mg/24hr
   patch qwed, aliskiren 150mg [**Hospital1 **].
   -- 1:1 nursing observation of po med therapy
   -- PD x4 each day: Will increase PD fill volume to 1.25.
   -- pain and nausea control as below
   #Chest Pain: Currently no pain and hemodynamically stable. No changes
   on serial EKGs, initial enzymes negative. In setting of gastroccult pos
   emesis before pain. Pt given GI cocktail with relief from pain. Most
   likely etiology includes GERD and PUD with possible bleeding ulcer,
   however, still considering Angina or ACS (given risk factors).
   -Continue to rule out ACS with serial enzymes
   -Consider increasing pantoprozole 40mg PO qday to [**Hospital1 **]
   # Nausea/Diarrhea/Abd Pain:  Lower abd pain continues to be of unclear
   etiology.  Lactates have been normal and infectious work-up negative.
   Small bowel enteroscopy negative for abnormal findings. No new issues.
   -- Currently has MSIR 30-45 mg PO Q6H:PRN; standing order for Morphine
   2-4mg IV q4PRN.
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  s/p PDx4 yesterday. Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.
   -- continue PD per renal recs as above.
   -- patient will likely need HD as she may not be getting sufficient
   dialysis with PD; however, still refuses HD.
   -- appreciate renal recs
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Chronic anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Bicarb of
   23 now.
   -- renal recs
   -- trend HCO3
   #hypocalcemia: Currently, calcium improved at 7.9 although still low.
   Anticipate decrease Ca with transfusion
   -Will check Calcium daily and provide calcium gluconate 4mg IV PRN
   -Continue calcitriol
   # H/O Venous Thrombosis: INR now subtherapeutic at 1.9. Held coumadin
   yesterday and today with re to possible UGIB.
   -- Hold Coumadin until HCT stabilizes/post-GI scope
   -- D/C Heparin IV gtt
   -- trend INR
   # SLE:
   -- Cont prednisone 4mg home dose
   # OSA: pt unable to tolerate CPAP secondary to claustrophobia.
   Hypertensive episodes may be related to OSA.
   -- Will have respiratory therapy visit patient today and encourage
   small trials of CPAP to get patient used to mask.
   # FEN:
   -- NPO for possible GI scope. IVF to KVO. Replete lytes prn.
   # ACCESS:
   -- PD cath, PIV-20x1, mid-line on right

   PGY2 addendum:
   Agree with MSIV assessment/plan as detailed above.  Briefly, 24F with
   SLE, ESRD on PD, HTN, SVC syndrome; admit with abdominal pain and HTN
   urgency.  Current issues include Hct drop and concern for active UGIB
   with ?hematemesis yesterday.  GI aware, plan for scope in AM if
   continues to be stable.  Minimal PO/NPO today.   [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  Transfuse 2
   units and recheck this evening.  BP currently in 120s on above regimen,
   ?lower due to GI bleeding.  Continue antihypertensives (may switch to
   home regimen); consider increasing PD fluid concentration to get more
   fluid off (6L positive LOS).  Retrial of CPAP if tolerated.  Will
   monitor in MICU for now
 watching BP and hematocrits.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to SLE, malignant hypertension, and SVC syndrome. She presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and hypertensive urgency. The patient's current issues include a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) and concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with possible hematemesis yesterday. She is currently hemodynamically stable but with controlled blood pressure on antihypertensive medications. The plan is to perform a gastrointestinal (GI) scope tomorrow if she continues to be stable and to transfuse 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and recheck her Hct in the evening. She will continue with PD and may need hemodialysis (HD) as she may not be getting sufficient dialysis with PD. The patient also has metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and a history of venous thrombosis. Her anticoagulation therapy has been held due to possible UGIB, and her INR is subtherapeutic at 1.9. She will have respiratory therapy visit her today to encourage small trials of CPAP to get used to the mask. The patient's access includes PD catheter, PIV-20 gauge, and midline on the right. She is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for monitoring of blood pressure"

   (on warfarin) who initially presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and
   nausea and hypertensive urgency.
   #Anemia: Repeat HCT s/p 2u pRBCs increased HCT 20
26. Etiologies
   including UGIB from PUD or gastritis (given history of chronic
   prednisone use, previous CT findings of gastric wall edema, and
   possible uremic bleeding) or possible LGIB from ischemia (although
   negative stool guaiac, negative lactates); 1 PIV-20gauge placed in
   addition to midline. Hemodynamically stable.
   -Appreciate GI recs, will d/w GI re possible EGD today or tomorrow.
   -NPO for procedure; if procedure is tomorrow, will make NPO at midnight
   - Will continue to follow serial HCTs (will check at 5pm).

   -- 1:1 nursing observation of po med therapy
   -- PD x4 each day using 1.2L over 4hrs per PD.
   -- pain and nausea control as below
   #Fever: Tmax this am to 102. Etiologies include infection (UTI, PNA,
   gastroenteritis with resulting bacteremia), SLE, transfusion rxn
   (unlikely given length of time between fever and end of transfusion),
   or SVT/DVT (history of thrombosis with current sub-therapeutic INR).
   -Blood, Urine, and PD cultures sent (along with PD cell count). Will
   follow up results.
   -Acetaminophen 25-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN
   #Chest Pain: Mild epigastric/midsternal pain last night with reflux,
   given GI cocktail with relief from pain. Ruled out MI yesterday. Pt.
   Most likely etiology includes GERD and PUD with possible bleeding
   ulcer, however, still considering Angina or ACS (given risk factors).
   -pantoprozole 40mg PO qday to [**Hospital1 **]
   -GI cocktail PRN
   # Nausea/Diarrhea/Abd Pain:  Resolving. Initial lower abd pain
   continues to be of unclear etiology.  Lactates have been normal and
   infectious work-up negative.  Small bowel enteroscopy negative for
   abnormal findings. No new issues.
   -- Currently has MSIR 30-45 mg PO Q6H:PRN.
   # ESRD: [**2-11**] SLE.  Estimated GFR is 8mL/min.

   PGY2 addendum:
   Agree with MSIV assessment/plan as detailed above.  Briefly, 24F with
   SLE, ESRD on PD, HTN, SVC syndrome; admit with abdominal pain and HTN
   urgency.  Current issues include Hct drop and concern for active UGIB
   with ?hematemesis yesterday.  GI aware, plan for scope in AM if
   continues to be stable.  Minimal PO/NPO today.   [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  Transfuse 2
   units and recheck this evening.  BP currently in 120s on above regimen,
   ?lower due to GI bleeding.  Continue antihypertensives (may switch to
   home regimen); consider increasing PD fluid concentration to get more
   fluid off (6L positive LOS).  Retrial of CPAP if tolerated.  Will
   monitor in MICU for now
 watching BP and hematocrits.
","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to SLE, malignant hypertension, and multiple thrombotic events. She was admitted with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and hypertensive urgency. The patient is currently undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been on warfarin for her thrombotic events. She presents with anemia and a recent drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). There is concern for ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to possible peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, as well as lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) from ischemia. The patient's fever is attributed to various etiologies, including infection, SLE, transfusion reaction, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient's history of chronic prednisone use, previous CT findings of gastric wall edema, and possible uremic bleeding raise concerns about ongoing UGIB. Pantoprazole has been initiated to reduce gastric acid secretion, and a gastrointestinal (GI) scope is planned to identify the source of bleeding.

2. LGIB: Although stool guaiac is negative, the patient may still have LGIB due to ischemia. This possibility should be considered, and further investigation is warranted."

   PGY2 addendum:
   Agree with MSIV assessment/plan as detailed above.  Briefly, 24F with
   SLE, ESRD on PD, HTN, SVC syndrome; admit with abdominal pain and HTN
   urgency.  Current issues include Hct drop and concern for active UGIB
   with ?hematemesis yesterday.  GI aware, plan for scope in AM if
   continues to be stable.  Minimal PO/NPO today.   [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  Transfuse 2
   units and recheck this evening.  BP currently in 120s on above regimen,
   ?lower due to GI bleeding.  Continue antihypertensives (may switch to
   home regimen); consider increasing PD fluid concentration to get more
   fluid off (6L positive LOS).  Retrial of CPAP if tolerated.  Will
   monitor in MICU for now
 watching BP and hematocrits.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old woman with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to SLE, malignant hypertension, and multiple thrombotic events. She presented initially with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea, along with hypertensive urgency. The patient is currently on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been experiencing several complications.

The patient's current issues include anemia, hypotensive episodes, epigastric/midsternal discomfort with reflux, possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) or lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), and hypertension. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and low hemoglobin levels.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. UGIB: The patient has a history of chronic prednisone use, previous CT findings of gastric wall edema, and possible uremic bleeding. These factors increase the risk of UGIB. Pantoprazole has been prescribed to reduce gastric acid production and decrease the risk of bleeding ulcers.

2. LGIB: Although the stool guaiac test was negative, ischemia could still be a possible cause of LGIB. Further evaluation may be necessary to confirm or rule out this condition.

3. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure has been high, with a maximum systolic blood pressure of 180 mm"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypertensive urgency.
   HYPERTENSION -- improving control.  Now on oral meds.  Monitor BP.
   Continue Clonidine, Latetolol, Nicardipine, Hydralazine prn to maintain
   SBP <170 mmHg.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to gradual blood loss on background of ACD.  s/p
   transfusion.  Hct stable.  Continue erythropoetin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending GI evaluation.
   FEVER -- removed from blood transfusion.  Monitor for new infection.
   Consider medication related.  Evaluation in progress (blood, urine,
   sputum, stool cultures, C. diff, LFTs)
   SLE -- stable.  Continue steroids (Prednisone 4mg).
   SVC syndrome/DVT -- remote.  Continue coumadin, monitor INR
   OSA -- continue trial of CPAP with different mask.

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is admitted to the ICU with malignant hypertension and hypertensive urgency. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9 C (102 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 150/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has been off IV infusion for BP control but remains on oral medications. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells for low hematocrit due to presumed slow gastrointestinal blood loss. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is pending for GI evaluation.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, rash from Percocet, and itching from oral antibiotics. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except where noted.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, no overweight/obesity, thinness, anxiety, diaphoresis, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, no poor dentition, no endotracheal or nasogastric tubes, no cervical lymphadenopathy, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin without rash or jaundice, attentive neurologic status with purposeful movements, and normal muscle tone.

Laboratory values show elevated white blood"
