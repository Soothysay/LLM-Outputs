   Disposition:
","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and multiple myeloma. He presented to the hospital after an unwitnessed fall, which may have been due to syncope. He was found to have a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, for which he is awaiting endoscopy.

The patient's current condition includes the following medical complications:

1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient has evidence of upper GI bleeding, as indicated by the presence of coffee grounds in the nasogastric (NG) lavage. His initial Hct was 43, and on admission, it was 29. The goal is to maintain his Hct above 25%. He has received a transfusion and is being monitored closely.

2. Syncope: The patient likely experienced a vasovagal syncope, possibly related to volume depletion from the GI bleed. A head CT was performed, which showed no abnormalities.

3. Parkinson's Disease: The patient has Parkinson's disease and is being treated with donepezil and Namenda. The medications are given in the morning after the endoscopy.

4. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which needs to be closely monitored due to the recent GI bleed. Lasix and antihypertensive medications are being held off at this time.

5. CHF: The patient"

He presented after an unwitnessed fall, concerning for syncope, and was found to have a hematocrit drop and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 129/73 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's main concerns include upper GI bleed, syncope, Parkinson's disease, CHF, hypertension, acute kidney injury (ARF), coagulopathy, hematuria, leukocytosis, hypothyroidism, and potential multiple myeloma relapse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has an ongoing upper GI bleed, which can lead to continued blood loss and potential hypotension.
2. Syncope: The patient experienced a syncope episode, likely vasovagal due to volume depletion from GI bleeding.
3. Parkinson's disease: The patient has Parkinson's disease, which may lead to complications such as immobility and increased risk of falls.
4. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, and there are concerns about fluid overload given his current condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 year old male w/Parkinson after unwitnessed fall, w/subsequent GI
   hemorrhage/acute blood loss anemia/hypotension
   1. GI hemorrhage/hypotension: limited NG lavage on floor w/coffee grds,
   1 additional episode of melana here. Source likely upper GI (gastritis,
   PUD, etc.). On IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], transfuse 1 unit pTBC, serial Hct's, type
   and cross. Gi consulted and will scope tomorrow.
   2. Dizziness with possible syncope: leading possibilies include
   hypovolemic/orthostatic given upper GI bleed, vs. vagal as he was
   straining to have a BM. On telemetry to monitor for arrhythmia. TIA/CVA
   less likely given lack of focal neuro s/sx and unchanged head CT.
   3. Parkinson's: oral meds held pending EGD. has 1:1 sitter.
   4 hypotension: Currently improved, now hypertensive after fluid
   resuscitiation. Given ongoing GI bleed and no prior hx of HTN, no
   treatment for now.
   5. CHF: specifics unknown. Does not overtly appear fluid overloaded but
   will watch as he may require lasix if he becomes dyspneic.
   6. ARF: Baseline Cr 1.1, now increased. Suspect due to pre-renal
   azotemia & high BUN is likely from GI bleed. Will recheck w/further
   resuscitation
   7. Coagulopathy: Could represent limited nutrition - albumin is 3,
   which may be artificially high/concentrated as he appears hypvolemic.
   DIC panel pending, though suspicion low.
   8. Leukocytosis: no obvious evidence of infxn otherwise. Cultures
   pending.
   9. right lung nodule, C-spine abnormalities: further imaging
   (potentially outpt) when stable
   88 year old male w/Parkinson admitted last night after unwitnessed
   fall, w/subsequent GI hemorrhage/acute blood loss anemia/hypotension

   UPRBC/ On IV PPI [**Hospital1 **],  serial Hct's, type and cross. Gi consulted and
   will possibly scope tomorrow.
   2. Dizziness with possible syncope: leading possibilies include

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with Parkinson's disease and congestive heart failure who presented to the ICU with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, acute blood loss anemia, and hypotension. The patient experienced an unwitnessed fall while on the toilet, leading to dizziness and a possible syncopal episode. He was found by his wife on the bathroom floor and was subsequently taken to the emergency department.

Upon arrival in the ED, the patient's blood pressure was in the 80s, and he had an ECG that showed nonspecific changes. In the ED, his blood pressure improved to the 100s after receiving approximately 1 liter of normal saline. The patient's hemoglobin concentration fell from 29 in the ED to 24.5, with a baseline of 43 from several years ago. He received a unit of packed red blood cells as an ordered transfusion.

Currently, the patient is hemodynamically stable without any chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 78 bpm (72-110 bpm), blood pressure of 129/73 mmHg (104/54 mmHg), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (18-32 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with Parkinson's disease who presented with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, acute blood loss anemia, and hypotension. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. The patient's hemodynamic status and hematocrit levels have stabilized. However, he continues to experience melena, indicating ongoing GI bleeding. The plan is to scope the patient on Tuesday to identify the source of bleeding and perform endoscopic treatment if necessary. The patient is currently taking clear liquids orally but seems to be aspirating, which may require a switch to enteral feeding. Other notable findings include leukocytosis with a possible aspiration pneumonia on chest X-ray, hematuria that is improving with bladder wash, dizziness with possible syncope, and an increase in creatinine levels suggestive of acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's Parkinson's disease medication should be resumed, and further investigations such as a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and CT chest are pending to evaluate for congestive heart failure (CHF) and a right lung nodule, respectively. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be discussed for disposition later today if stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's ongoing melena indicates that there may still be active bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. This could lead to further blood loss, hypotension, and anemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU with GI bleed, acute blood loss anemia, and hypotension after an unwitnessed fall. The patient's hemodynamic status and hematocrit levels have stabilized. However, there are several ongoing concerns and potential complications to consider.

1. GI Hemorrhage/Hypotension: The patient continues to experience melena, indicating ongoing bleeding. A scope is planned for Tuesday, but the patient has a Zenker diverticulum which may complicate the procedure. The patient's hematocrit should be closely monitored, and he is currently on IV pantoprazole (PPI) to reduce acid production in the stomach. The patient is tolerating oral intake but seems to be aspirating, so thick liquids may need to be restricted.

2. Leukocytosis/Question of Aspiration: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infection or aspiration. The absence of fever suggests that infection is less likely. The presence of a reticular infiltrate in the left lower lobe (LLL) of the lungs on the chest X-ray raises concerns about aspiration pneumonitis. Further investigation is needed, including checking urine analysis (UA) and sputum culture results.

3. Dizziness with Possible Syncope: The patient experienced dizziness and possible syncope, potentially due to hypovolemia/orthost"

   Compared to the prior studies there is interval worsening of the
   interstitial
   opacities in perihilar areas as well as towards the periphery of the
   lungs and
   lower lobes, finding consistent with worsening pulmonary edema although
   widespread infection especially viral or mycoplasma cannot be excluded.
   There is also worsening in bibasal retrocardiac opacities which might
   represent
   atelectasis. No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated as well as
   there is no pneumothorax. The previously demonstrated right upper lobe
   nodule is not seen on the current study most likely representing
   summation of shadows.

   Compared to the prior studies there is interval worsening of the
   interstitial
   opacities in perihilar areas as well as towards the periphery of the
   lungs and
   lower lobes, finding consistent with worsening pulmonary edema although
   widespread infection especially viral or mycoplasma cannot be excluded.
   There is also worsening in bibasal retrocardiac opacities which might
   represent
   atelectasis. No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated as well as
   there is no pneumothorax. The previously demonstrated right upper lobe
   nodule is not seen on the current study most likely representing
   summation of shadows.

He has a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, awaiting endoscopy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has melena, which indicates upper GI bleeding. Continued monitoring and management of the bleeding site is necessary.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which is being addressed with D5W replacement. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.

3. Syncope: The patient likely experienced a vasovagal syncope due to volume depletion from GI bleeding. Monitoring and management of blood pressure and volume status is important.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. Trending down without antibiotics suggests a possible non-infectious cause. Further evaluation of urine and sputum cultures is needed.

5. Parkinson's disease: The patient is being treated with donepezil and Namenda for Parkinson's disease. These medications should continue as per the physician's orders.

6. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure. Close monitoring is necessary, especially considering the recent GI bleeding. Lasix and antihypertensives may need to be considered once the bleeding is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU with acute blood loss anemia and hypotension following an unwitnessed fall. The patient has been experiencing melena, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. His hemodynamic parameters are stable, but he requires ongoing resuscitation with intravenous fluids. 

The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, suggesting a possible infection or aspiration pneumonia. A chest X-ray shows a possible infiltrate in the left lower lobe, which needs further evaluation. 

The patient's Foley catheter is draining clear urine, and his vital signs are stable. However, he is at risk for aspiration due to his Zenker diverticulum. 

The patient's dizziness and possible syncope may be related to hypovolemia or orthostatic hypotension, but other causes such as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) are less likely given the lack of focal neurological symptoms and unchanged head CT. 

The patient also has hematuria, which is improving with bladder wash. His platelets are trending down, and he requires monitoring for further complications. 

In addition to his current conditions, the patient has a history of Parkinson's disease and possible chronic heart failure. He has mild hypernatremia and his renal function is deteriorating, with an increasing creatinine level. 

The patient's coagulation profile is stable,"

The patient is an 88-year-old male with Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, acute blood loss anemia, and hypotension. The patient had an unwitnessed fall and subsequently developed melena, indicating upper GI bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been decreasing despite no active bleeding observed. The patient is currently on intravenous pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs remain stable with a blood pressure of 125/71 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient's temperature is within normal limits at 36.4°C.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,185 mL and an output of 1,580 mL, indicating a positive fluid balance of 605 mL. The patient received a total of 1,975 mL of intravenous fluids.

Laboratory results show a low white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.3 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.2%, and platelet count of 116 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated at 130 mg/dL and 1.5 mg/dL, respectively. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's disease who presented to the ICU after experiencing an unwitnessed fall, resulting in a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and acute blood loss anemia. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, but the hematocrit (Hct) level has decreased further without active bleeding. The patient has been receiving intravenous pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has been on a thickened liquid diet. The patient's leukocytosis has resolved, and hypernatremia has improved. There are concerns regarding possible aspiration due to a Zenker diverticulum. The patient's dizziness with possible syncope may be related to hypovolemia or orthostatic hypotension from the upper GI bleed or vagal response during defecation. The patient's Foley catheter insertion may have caused hematuria, which is improving with bladder wash. The patient's baseline creatinine level has improved. The patient's coagulation status is stable, and there are no signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's right lung nodule needs further evaluation with a CT chest. The patient's Parkinson's disease medications should be resumed, and confusion at baseline should be monitored. The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute renal failure (ARF) need further assessment. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's dementia, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and multiple myeloma. The patient presented after an unwitnessed fall concerning for syncope and was found to have a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The family declined endoscopy, and the patient continues to require transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient has ongoing upper GI bleeding, as evidenced by the presence of coffee grounds in the nasogastric (NG) lavage. The patient's Hct baseline was 43 in [**2104**], and they have already received one unit of transfusion for a Hct < 25. The goal is to maintain a Hct > 25. Further evaluation with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is needed, and the family needs to be rediscussed regarding this procedure.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels were normalized this morning. The patient is holding intravenous fluids (IVF) due to respiratory discomfort overnight. Trending electrolytes is recommended.

3. Syncope: The patient likely experienced vasovagal syncope due to volume depletion from GI bleeding. A head computed tomography (CT) scan was performed and showed no abnormalities. Telemetry monitoring is ongoing, and the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of Parkinson's dementia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypothyroidism. He presented after an unwitnessed fall concerning for syncope, subsequently found to have a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGB). The family declined endoscopy, and no transfusions have been given since yesterday morning. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI Bleed: The patient has a history of UGB with positive coffee grounds in the nasogastric (NG) lavage. His baseline Hct was 43 in [**2104**], but it has dropped to 29.7 currently. The patient received a blood transfusion yesterday for Hct < 25 and is now hemodynamically stable. The goal for the patient's Hct should be >25. Awaiting gastrointestinal consultation for further evaluation and management.

2. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, as evidenced by the increased volume overload on chest X-ray after hydration. There is also a murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient received lasix yesterday with blood products. Assess clinically and repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) ordered.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have normalized this morning. Holding intravenous fluids due to respiratory discomfort overnight. Trend"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently comfortable in the ICU. There has been no bleeding overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate within normal range, blood pressure slightly low but within acceptable limits, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but not receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of scattered basilar crackles in the respiratory system. The physical examination reveals a systolic murmur, III/VI in intensity, and trace edema in both lower extremities. The patient is unable to stand due to their condition. Neurological examination shows that the patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli, but motor tone and assessment could not be performed.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 K/uL, and slightly decreased platelet count of 116 K/uL. Kidney function is within normal range with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. Other lab results show normal electrolyte levels, except for a slightly low calcium level of 7.1 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, syncope, congestive heart failure, coagulopathy, Parkinson's disease, hematuria, and anemia secondary to blood loss"
