","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with paraplegia, chronic stage VI decubitus ulcer, osteomyelitis, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to neurogenic bladder and chronic Foley placement. The patient presented with fever and hypotension, which were initially attributed to septic shock. However, the hypotension resolved with fluid resuscitation, and no clear source of infection has been identified. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. The patient has been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with fever and hypotension, suggesting a possible severe infection leading to septic shock. Although the hypotension has resolved, it is crucial to continue monitoring the patient closely for any signs of deterioration.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.9 to 1.5, indicating potential renal dysfunction. This could be due to pre-renal azotemia resulting from dehydration or an ongoing infection.
3. Chronic Sacral Decubitus Ulcer/Osteomyelitis: The patient has a stage 4 decubitus ulcer with associated osteomyelitis. Proper wound care and antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent further complications, including potential spread of infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of paraplegia, chronic stage VI decubitus ulcer, and osteomyelitis. He presents with fever and hypotension, which are indicative of septic shock. The patient has received a total of 8 liters of normal saline and his blood pressure is now stable with a central venous pressure (CVP) around 7-8 mmHg. Blood cultures have shown gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a possible infection from the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The PICC line is being pulled as a potential source of infection. Surveillance cultures will continue, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed to rule out endocarditis if there are persistently positive blood cultures or fevers.

The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on room air, and his respiratory support is minimal. He has a wound infection with 2+ polys on Gram stain, negative glucose, and is pending further microbiology results. Blood cultures and urine cultures are also pending.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and lactate levels. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, indicating renal impairment. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium (K+). Other"

   addition he has a R PICC line which was cultured here as well (initial

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with paraplegia, chronic stage VI decubitus ulcer, and osteomyelitis. He presented with fever and hypotension after being off antibiotics from a nursing home. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation. His vital signs are stable, with a CVP around 7-8 mmHg. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. The patient's wound looks extensive but clean, and there is no evidence of pneumonia on the chest X-ray. He has a right PICC line, which was cultured.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient presented with fever and hypotension, which is consistent with sepsis. He responded to fluid resuscitation, indicating septic shock. The source of infection is still being investigated, with blood cultures and urine cultures pending.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient developed pre-renal azotemia, as indicated by a creatinine level of 1.5 (up from 0.9). This is likely due to dehydration and possibly related to sepsis.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased from baseline 6 to 10, suggesting an inflammatory response or infection.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 25.6 g/d"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with paraplegia, chronic stage VI decubitus ulcer, and osteomyelitis. He has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to neurogenic bladder and chronic Foley placement. The patient presents with fever and hypotension, which responded to fluid resuscitation. Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a possible source of infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/66 to 147/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm on ECG. Physical examination reveals crackles in the left base of the lungs and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis Shock: The patient's initial hypotension responded to fluid resuscitation, and current blood pressure is stable. Blood cultures indicate gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a potential source of infection. It is recommended to pull the PICC line as a likely source of infection and continue surveillance cultures. A trans-thoracic echo (TTE) should be performed to rule out endocarditis, and if persistently positive blood cultures or fevers occur, a trans-esophageal echo (TEE) may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of paraplegia, chronic stage VI decubitus ulcer, and osteomyelitis. He presents with fever and hypotension after being off antibiotics from a nursing home. The patient has recurrent urinary tract infections due to neurogenic bladder and chronic Foley placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia with hypotension, indicating the possibility of sepsis. He is being treated for this condition.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and is receiving prophylaxis with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin.
3. Pressure Ulcers: The patient has a chronic stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer. Proper wound care and nutritional support are needed to prevent further complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease. Iron studies show anemia of chronic disease, and his B12 and folate levels are normal.
5. Neurogenic Bladder: The patient has a neurogenic bladder, which increases the risk of urinary tract infections. Foley catheter changes are necessary to prevent infection.
6. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression with venlafaxine.
7. Osteomyelitis: The patient has osteomyelitis of the sacrum. Antibiotics and wound care are ongoing to treat"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no known drug allergies. They have been admitted to the ICU due to hypotension. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged except for the noted events below.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, which was started on June 28th at 8:24 AM and stopped at 2:00 PM. A trans-thoracic echo was performed on June 28th at 10:00 AM. Blood cultures were taken on June 29th at 2:54 AM.

The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium for thrombosis and has been on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected MRSA infection. Their vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 95/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 2,260 mL, output of 2,500 mL, and a negative balance of 240 mL since midnight.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, warm skin,"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 95/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and heparin sodium. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as low platelet count. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and they are being treated for MRSA. The patient's nutritional status is described as full, and they are on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has a Presep catheter in place and is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and they are expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
