   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a previous case of Clostridium difficile infection (c.diff). He presents with fluid overload after missing several dialysis sessions. The patient's initial condition included hyperkalemia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). However, his symptoms have improved after a dialysis session overnight, and his mental status has returned to baseline.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 135/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 13.4 g/dL, white blood cell count of 212 K/uL, blood glucose level of 87 mg/dL, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 10.2 mg/dL. The patient also has an elevated BUN level of 40.5% and a slightly elevated phosphorus level of 4.4 mg/dL. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, calcium, magnesium, and"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile (c.diff). He presented with fluid overload after missing several dialysis sessions. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR) and diabetes mellitus (DM).

On the 24-hour flow sheet, the patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. His temperature is within normal range at 36.6°C. The patient is well-nourished and thin in appearance. There are no signs of endotracheal or nasogastric tubes.

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the right base, suggesting a possible pulmonary edema or effusion. The patient's abdomen is soft with bowel sounds present and mild tenderness. There is no edema in his extremities. The skin is warm and without rash or jaundice. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, oriented, and purposeful with no signs of sedation or paralysis.

Laboratory results show an elevated serum creatinine level of 10.2 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment. Hemoglobin is at 13.4 g/d"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyperkalemia. The patient experienced intermittent episodes of chest pain yesterday, described as substernal pressure without radiation, diaphoresis, or nausea. Nitroglycerin was given but had little effect. Repeat EKGs showed no change. The patient also had small loose bowel movements but no abdominal pain overnight. The patient's allergies include morphine, which causes itching. Antibiotics were last administered on [**2155-8-17**] 12:20 AM. Infusions and other ICU medications are mentioned but not specified. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the chest pain. Flowsheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen with a SpO2 of 100%. ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings and lab results indicate hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine), electrolyte imbalances, and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging studies are also mentioned but not described. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, respiratory infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), grade 4 diastolic heart failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), severe depression, and crack cocaine use. The patient presents with hyperkalemia at a level of 7.4 and atrial fibrillation with RVR in the setting of missing dialysis for the past week. He has a long history of missing dialysis sessions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 7.4, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, increasing the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
3. Altered mental status: The patient may have a decreased level of consciousness, possibly due to recent cocaine use, uremia, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's body is experiencing an imbalance in acid-base levels, which can be caused by renal failure and lactic acidosis.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient requires hemodialysis due to end-stage renal disease, and non-compliance with dialysis sessions can lead to further complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia. He presented with multiple episodes of chest discomfort yesterday, but his ECG did not show any ischemic changes. The patient's potassium levels have improved, and he is hemodynamically stable with good oxygen saturation on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

24-hour events include:
- EKG showing no ischemic changes.
- Allergies to morphine, which causes itching.
- Infusions of various medications.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for chest discomfort.
- Vital signs are within normal range, with a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 700 mL and output of 2,110 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,410 mL.
- Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, normal cardiovascular system, crackles in the left base of the chest, and no cyanosis or clubbing.
- Neurologic assessment shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Lab results indicate:
- Hemoglobin: 13.9 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 5.7 K/uL
- Creatinine: 10.2 mg/dL
- Blood urea nitrogen: 40.9 mg/dL
- Glucose: 73 mg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hyperkalemia. He has experienced episodes of watery, yellowish diarrhea overnight and epigastric pain that was mostly relieved with Maalox and Tylenol. The patient has a history of morphine allergy and received antibiotics. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F), blood pressure ranging from 132/98 to 124/79 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 68.9 kg.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of potassium (K+) at 27 K/uL, low sodium (Na+) at 139 mg/dL, high chloride (Cl-) at 98 mEq/L, low bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 6.0 mEq/L, and low hemoglobin (Hb) at 10.2 g/dL. Other lab values include elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 5.7, decreased hematocrit (Hct) at 40.5, decreased platelet count (Plt) at 212, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 10.2, and low magnesium (Mg++) at 2.1 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hyperkalemia: The elevated potassium levels can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory distress.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's episodes of watery, yellowish diarrhea may indicate an underlying gastrointestinal infection or condition, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Epigastric pain: The patient's epigastric pain may suggest an underlying abdominal issue such as gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, which can worsen if left untreated.
4. Allergy to morphine: The patient's known allergy to morphine should be taken into consideration when selecting medications or interventions to avoid an allergic reaction.
5. Elevated creatinine levels: The high creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which can result in the accumulation of waste products in the body and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Low magnesium levels: The low magnesium levels can lead to muscle cramps, irregular heart rhythms, and respiratory problems.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note and potential medical complications based on the provided information. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and management of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan:
   Assessment: 57yo M with a h/o systolic (EF 20-25) and grade 4 diastolic
   heart failure, ESRD [**2-15**] DM on HD, atrial fibrillation with RVR, severe
   depression, crack cocaine use presents with hyperkalemia to 7.4 and
   atrial fibrillation with RVR to 150s in setting of missing dialysis for
   the past week, of note patient with long history of missing dialysis
   sessions
   .
   Plan:
   # Hyperkalemia
   Secondary to ESRD and missing dialysis, treated with 2 grams calcium
   gluconate, dextrose, IV regular insulin, 30g kayexalate, bicarbonate in
   the emergency room. Last K+ at 2200 was 6.3 after treatment.
   - Renal on board. Pt to get HD again this a.m.
   - Continue to hold lisinopril
   - F/u on pending a.m. lytes
   - Recheck K+ at after HD
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation
   Has history pf afib RVR, component of volume overload causing atrial
   stretch, acidosis and uremia also exacerbating, ? compliance with
   medications. Rate controlled.
   - Continue home Labetalol
   - prn IV labetalol
   - HD to remove volume, goal 1-2 liters during HD
   .
   #Chest pain
   Pt continues to have same chronic chest pain unrelieved by nitro.
   Reproducible on palpation of lateral chest wall. Slightly improved with
   Maalox.
   -          Continue Maalox PRN, PPI
   -           Will try Ibuprofen for pain
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial [**2-15**] recent cocaine use,
   uremia. Appears to be back to baseline.
   - Blood culture x2
   - non focal neuro exam, no indication for head imaging given with
   stimulation he is appropriate and moving all extremities
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Anion gap metabolic acidosis
   On admission, secondary to renal failure and mildly elevated lactic
   acid level also contributing. AG improved.
   - Pt to get HD today.
   .
   # ESRD on HD
   - HD today. [**Month (only) 60**]  resume TThSat schedule. F/u on Renal recs.
   - On home cinacalcet and sevelamer
   - Continue to avoid nephrotoxins.
   .
   # CAD
   - On Aspirin, labetalol, hold ACE
   - Pt continues to have chronic chest pain.
   .
   # C. difficile colitis
   - continue treatment with flagyl
   .
   # DM II
   - Humalog sliding scale, hold NPH given poor PO intake and history of
   hypoglycemia
   .
   # HTN: stable.
   - Continuing home Labetalol, Lisinopri held for now.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia
   [**2-15**] [**Name (NI) 2118**], PTH 414 on [**7-22**]
   - continue phos binder and cinacalcet
   .
   # Depression
   Place back on home meds (Zoloft)
   .
   # FEN: renal/cardiac heart healthy diet, low K+
   .
   # Access- PIV, right sided EJ and fistula
   .
   # PPx:  PPI, pneumoboots

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%), grade 4 diastolic heart failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM) on hemodialysis (HD), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), severe depression, and crack cocaine use. He presents with hyperkalemia to 7.4 and atrial fibrillation with RVR in the setting of missing dialysis for the past week. The patient has a long history of missing dialysis sessions.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/98 to 124/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, mild bibasilar crackles in the lungs, soft and normoactive bowel sounds, and 2+ pedal pulses without edema or pneumoboots.

Laboratory results show potassium levels of 7.4, sodium levels of 139 mg/dL, chloride levels of 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate levels of 27 mEq/L, BUN of 40.9 g/dL, creatinine levels of 8.1 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 73 to 139 mg/dL, and a white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL. Other lab results include a platelet count of 212 K/uL, troponin-T levels of 0.38, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's medical conditions include hyperkalemia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, altered mental status, anion gap metabolic acidosis, ESRD on HD, coronary artery disease (CAD), C. difficile colitis, DM II, hypertension (HTN), hypercalcemia, depression, and malnutrition. The patient is currently being treated with various medications such as calcium gluconate, insulin, kayexalate, bicarbonate, lisinopril, labetalol, PPI, cinacalcet, sevelamer, and Zoloft.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening hyperkalemia, cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation and RVR, further deterioration of renal function, worsening anion gap metabolic acidosis, complications related to ESRD and HD, exacerbation of CAD, worsening C. difficile colitis, poorly controlled DM II, uncontrolled HTN, and potential nutritional deficiencies."
