   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From family
   history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day. This could
   be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be exacerbated by
   patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could hypothesize that
   patient took additional narcotics which depressed his already-tenuous
   respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA
   arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on admit not
   necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - treat other issues as below
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now (? heparin allergy)
   .
   # ACcess: R IJ CVL, right radial arterial line
   .
   # CODE: full, discussed with family
   .
   # COMM: with patient and family. Son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4273**] is HCP ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4276**], Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4277**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrioventricular block, and tuberculosis. The patient presented to the hospital status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The circumstances surrounding the arrest are unclear, but it may be related to chronic hypercarbia and the use of multiple narcotic pain medications. Other possible etiologies such as cardiac event, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary embolism, or hypothermia are less likely.

The patient's hypotension upon arrival to the ICU could be due to profound acidosis during resuscitation or hypothermia. Pressors were quickly weaned off upon arrival to the ICU. The patient also had leukocytosis and bandemia, which could indicate an underlying infectious source, most likely pneumonia given the infiltrates seen on chest CT. Cardiac function is preserved at this time, so cardiac shock is less suspected.

The patient has multiple pulmonary issues, including sleep apnea (obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias. He also takes multiple narcotics and other medications, which could contribute to altered mental status and exacerbate hypoventilation.

Renal insufficiency is present, with an unclear baseline creatinine level. The patient's blood pressure is currently stable without the need for pressors, but it was previously unstable. The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From family
   history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day. This could
   be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be exacerbated by
   patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could hypothesize that
   patient took additional narcotics which depressed his already-tenuous
   respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA
   arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on admit not
   necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - treat other issues as below
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now (? heparin allergy)
   .
   # ACcess: R IJ CVL, left radial arterial line
   .
   # CODE: full, discussed with family
   .
   # COMM: with patient and family. Son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4273**] is HCP ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4276**], Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4277**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrioventricular replacement (AVR) x2, and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) who presented status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 121/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological status is altered with minimal responses and no corneal reflex. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, shock, renal insufficiency, elevated cardiac enzymes, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic pain, and fecal incontinence. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and will continue to be monitored closely for any changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Shock: The patient has experienced hypotension and required multiple pressors. There is a concern for ongoing shock, possibly due to sepsis or an underlying infectious source.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From family
   history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day. This could
   be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be exacerbated by
   patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could hypothesize that
   patient took additional narcotics which depressed his already-tenuous
   respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA
   arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on admit not
   necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - treat other issues as below
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now (? heparin allergy)
   .
   # ACcess: R IJ CVL, right radial arterial line

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrioventricular replacement valve surgery twice, and tuberculosis of the bone. He presented status post PEA arrest. The circumstances surrounding the arrest are unclear, but it may have been due to hypercarbia exacerbated by multiple narcotic pain medications. Another possibility is a cardiac event, although the EKG on admission does not necessarily indicate a myocardial infarction. Other etiologies such as electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary embolism, or hypothermia are less likely given the lab and scan results. The patient's neurologic status following this event is uncertain.

The patient's hypotension on arrival could be related to profound acidosis during resuscitation or hypothermia. Following aggressive intravenous fluids in the emergency department, pressors were quickly weaned off on arrival to the ICU. This hypotension could also be due to an underlying infectious source, with infiltrates seen on chest CT being the most obvious source. The patient's cardiac function is preserved at this time, so there is less suspicion for cardiac shock.

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, and the precipitant is unclear.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, will
   keep on vent with plan to diurese today, wean in Am tomorrow with
   extubation on [**12-22**]
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting - obtained
   - send sputum culture
 if available
   - add on urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-21**]
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   will eval for baseline renal fxn
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - pressures remain stable off pressors
   - this AM pt had misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will interrogate in AM
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will start Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started Labetalol and Hydral
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrioventricular replacement (AVR) twice, and tuberculous meningitis (TBM) status post tracheal stent. He presented with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multiple pulmonary issues, including sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, recurrent pneumonias, and the use of narcotics and other medications that could contribute to altered mental status and hypoventilation. The ventilator settings need to be adjusted based on the arterial blood gas (ABG) results. The plan is to wean him off the ventilator tomorrow morning with extubation scheduled for [**12-22**].

2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear. It would be helpful to obtain records from his primary care physician or the healthcare provider over the weekend. The creatinine level is improving with intravenous fluids (IVF) and resuscitation. The plan is to trend creatinine, avoid nephrotoxins, obtain records from the primary care physician, and evaluate for baseline renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, severe obstructive sleep apnea, chronic renal failure, and tracheobronchomalacia with tracheal stenting. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic pain. He is intubated and sedated, but follows simple commands. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.3°F, blood pressure of 150/65 mmHg, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias. These factors contribute to his current respiratory failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off sedation. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, and the underlying cause is unclear. Possible etiologies include cardiac events, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary embolism, or hypothermia. Further evaluation"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, will
   keep on vent with plan to diurese today, wean in Am tomorrow with
   extubation on [**12-22**]
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting - obtained
   - send sputum culture
 if available
   - add on urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-21**]
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   will eval for baseline renal fxn
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - pressures remain stable off pressors
   - this AM pt had misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will interrogate in AM
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will start Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started Labetalol and Hydral
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now

   # ACcess: Right IJ CVL, Right radial arterial line

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrioventricular block, and tuberculosis who presented status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He has multiple pulmonary issues, including sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, recurrent pneumonias, and chronic hypercarbia. He also takes multiple narcotics and other medications that could contribute to altered mental status and exacerbate hypoventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and will be weaned off gradually. There is a need to adjust ventilator settings based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results and monitor for any signs of worsening respiratory failure.
2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear, and there is a need to trend creatinine levels, avoid nephrotoxins, and obtain records from the primary care physician (PCP) to establish a recent creatinine baseline.
3. Cardiac Status: The circumstances surrounding the arrest are unclear, but it could be related to chronic hypercarbia or a cardiac event. The patient's pacemaker misfired, and an electrophysiologist (EP) will interrogate the device. Cardiac enzymes will be monitored for any acute changes.
4. Shock: The patient initially had profound hypotension on arrival but stabilized after aggressive intravenous fluid"

   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-22**]
   - adjust meds for normal renal fxn
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 sensitive renal fxn with baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - this AM pt had continued misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will re-eval
   - support respiratory failure prn
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will advance Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started correction to previous note - started Metoprolol and Hydral
   [**12-20**]
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less
   suspicion for cardiac shock. Resolved
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   - cycle CKs to peak

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrioventricular block (AVR) x2, and tuberculous meningitis (TBM) status post tracheal stent. He presents after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical issues, including respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, cardiac status concerns, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic pain, and shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multiple pulmonary issues, including sleep apnea (likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires adjustment of ventilator settings based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results.

2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear, and there is a need to obtain records from his primary care physician (PCP) to establish a recent creatinine baseline. The patient's creatinine level is currently improving with intravenous fluid resuscitation (IVF) and resuscitation.

3. Cardiac Status: The patient had a PEA arrest, and the circumstances surrounding the arrest are unclear. It could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia, exacerbated by the patient's use of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon arrival, he was found to be in cardiac arrest and subsequently resuscitated. He was intubated and admitted to the ICU for further management. Since admission, his condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, altered mental status, and an episode of hypotension requiring vasopressor support. He has received multiple antibiotics and other medications to manage his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and sputum culture will be necessary to detect any signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing DVT. Regular lower extremity assessments and consideration for prophylactic anticoagulation may be required.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of vasopressors can increase the risk of stress-related mucosal disease. Proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole have been initiated to provide gastric protection.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could progress to delirium due to ICU psychosis, medication effects, or sepsis. Frequent neurological"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, will
   keep on vent with plan to diurese y/d, with extubation on [**12-22**]
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting - obtained
   - send sputum culture
 if available
 Coag + SA
 cover with Vanc
   Cefepime until [**Last Name (un) 4361**]
   - add on urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-22**]
   - adjust meds for normal renal fxn
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 sensitive renal fxn with baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - this AM pt had continued misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will re-eval
   - support respiratory failure prn
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will advance Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started correction to previous note - started Metoprolol and Hydral
   [**12-20**]
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less
   suspicion for cardiac shock. Resolved
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now
   .
   # ACcess: Right IJ CVL, Right radial arterial line

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrioventricular block, and tuberculosis who presented status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He has multiple pulmonary issues, including sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias. The patient also takes multiple narcotics and other medications that could contribute to altered mental status and exacerbate hypoventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multiple pulmonary issues, including sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias. His altered mental status due to narcotics use can exacerbate hypoventilation, leading to respiratory failure. Adjusting ventilator settings based on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is necessary. Weaning from mechanical ventilation and extubation may be planned.

2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear. Trending creatinine levels is important to monitor renal function improvement with intravenous fluids (IVF) and resuscitation. Adjusting medications for normal renal function and avoiding nephrotoxins are recommended. Obtaining records from the primary care physician (PCP) to establish the recent creatinine baseline is necessary.

3. Cardiac Status: The circumstances surrounding the PEA arrest are unclear. The patient's use of narcotics and potential chronic hypercarbia could contribute to"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a middle-aged male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, altered mental status, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and cardiac arrest. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/55 mmHg to 171/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is mechanically ventilated using CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE if they dislodge and travel to the lungs.

   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.

   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3

The patient presents with status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is unclear, and there is an improvement in renal function with intravenous fluids (IVF) and resuscitation. Trending creatinine levels, avoiding nephrotoxins, and obtaining records from the patient's primary care physician (PCP) or coverage over the weekend will be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and tuberculosis who presented status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, recurrent pneumonias, and altered mental status. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to multiple pulmonary issues, including sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias. The patient was extubated on a face tent and is now on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) support.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, and the cause is unclear. It could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia exacerbated by narcotic pain medications or a cardiac event. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and prevent future cardiac arrests.

3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are uncertain. There is an improvement in renal function with intravenous fluids (IVF) and resuscitation. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and medications will be adjusted accordingly to avoid nephrotoxins.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, on vent
   overnight - > diuresed overnight and this AM
 extubated on [**12-23**]
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
 if available
 Coag + SA
 cover with
   Vanc/Cefepime until [**Last Name (un) 4361**]
   - urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-23**]
   - adjusted meds for improved renal fxn
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   - obtained recs from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 renal fxn baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
 EP will
   re-eval [**12-23**]
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started correction to previous note - started Metoprolol and Hydral
   [**12-20**]
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc.
   .
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less
   suspicion for cardiac shock. Resolved
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now

   exacerbate hypoventilation.

   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and cardiac arrest. On review of systems, there are no significant changes from admission except for the following:
- Respiratory support: The patient was previously on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated at 11:00 AM on 12/23/2177.
- Medications: The patient received cefipime and vancomycin antibiotics, pantoprazole (Protonix), metoprolol, and hydralazine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the previous need for invasive ventilation and acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of reintubation if the patient's condition deteriorates.
2. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or changes in vital signs, is necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate poor organ perfusion. Monitoring and appropriate management of blood pressure are crucial.
4. Diabetic complications: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, which increases the risk of complications such as hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Cardiac issues: Given the patient's history of hypertension and cardiac arrest, there is a risk of cardiac"

   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.

   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.

 renal fxn baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).

   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrioventricular replacement (AVR) x 2, and tuberculous meningitis (TBM) status post tracheal stent. The patient presented status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has multiple pulmonary issues such as sleep apnea (likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias. These factors contribute to the risk of respiratory failure. The patient was on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated on a face tent.

2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level is unclear. There is a possibility of renal insufficiency, which may be related to shock and arrest. The patient's renal function is improving with intravenous fluids (IVF) and resuscitation.

3. Cardiac status: The circumstances surrounding the arrest are unclear. The patient may have experienced a cardiac event, but the electrocardiogram (EKG) on admission does not necessarily indicate a myocardial infarction (MI). Other potential causes of the cardiac arrest include electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary embolism (PE), hypothermia, and narcotic overdose.

4. Neurologic deficits: The patient's"

   # Respiratory failure:  Resolving. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.

   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on

   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, aortic valve replacement (AVR) twice, and tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting. He presented status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
- The patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias. He also takes multiple narcotics and other medications which could contribute to altered mental status.
- The patient was extubated on [**12-23**] and obtained records regarding tracheal stenting.
- Coagulation and Staphylococcus aureus coverage with Vancomycin were initiated, awaiting sensitivities.
- The patient's sputum showed growth of only OP flora, likely just a colonizer. Therefore, the antibiotics were not changed. If spikes or clinically worsens, meropenem will be added for possible ESBL or pseudomonas.
- The patient's urine legionella antigen was negative.
- Renal insufficiency resolved, and the baseline creatinine returned to the normal range.
- The cardiac status is unclear, with possible causes including chronic hypercarbia, hypoxia, or a cardiac event. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
- Neurologic deficits are unclear due to the patient's altered mental status and prolonged time without oxygen during the arrest.
- The patient's diabetes mellitus is under better control with insulin gtt and monitoring of blood sugars q1h.
- Hypertension is being managed with antihypertensives, including metoprolol and hydralazine.
- Hypercholesterolemia will be addressed with a statin once the patient is clear to take oral medications.
- Chronic pain management will be reassessed continuously.
- Elevation of CK levels is not likely cardiac-related.
- The patient is attempting to take pills with applesauce and advance diet if tolerating pills well.
- Prophylaxis for pneumonia and stress ulcers is being provided.
- The patient has a right internal jugular central venous line (CVL) and a right radial arterial line. A PICC line is requested for discontinuation of the right IJ CVL.
- Code status is full code.
- Disposition: ICU care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, aortic valve replacement twice, and tuberculosis of the trachea who presented status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, recurrent pneumonias, and is taking multiple narcotics which could contribute to altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias. He also takes multiple narcotics that can exacerbate hypoventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory function is necessary.
2. Cardiac Status: The patient's cardiac status is unclear due to the circumstances surrounding the arrest. It is possible that the patient experienced a cardiac event leading to the PEA arrest. Continuous monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and cardiac enzymes is recommended.
3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient initially presented with renal insufficiency, but it has resolved. However, the patient may be at risk for further renal dysfunction due to factors such as hypotension and the use of nephrotoxic medications. Monitoring of renal function and avoiding nephrotoxins is important.
4. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to anoxic injury from the prolonged time without adequate oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.
   - extubated on [**12-23**], sating well on 4L
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   -Coag + SA
 cover with Vanc, awaiting sensitivities
   - [**12-23**] sputum with multiple bacteria on GS. Concerning given treatment
   with cefepime. However prelim growth of only OP flora, likely just
   colonizer. Therefore have not changed abx. If spikes or clinically
   worsens add meropenem for possible ESBL or pseudomonas. Sputum
   decreasing
   - urine legionella antigen
 negative
   -continue to diurese to improve resp status. Goal negative 1.5 L daily
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Resolved. baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per
   [**Hospital3 3928**]. Likely that creatinine will be higher in setting of
   shock and arrest, already improving with IVF and resuscitation. Now
   returned to [**Location 810**] range
   - trend creatinine
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
   re-evaled [**12-23**] shortened a sensing interval
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   -repeat echo, EF greater than 55 %, high transaoritc valve pressure
   gradiant. Largely unchanged since echo on presentation
   .
   # mental status: question of anoxic injury after down so long in field.
   Pt improving but remains slow to respond
   -trend MS

   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Was on
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension:Held antihypertensives on arrival w given pressor
   requirement. Now stabilized, restarting home reg
   - started Metoprolol and Hydral [**12-20**]
   - Restarted ACE as trial for swallowing Pills. If tolerates convert to
   previous oral BP reg
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when clear patient taking
   POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc. Not complaining of significant pain.
   ..
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, aortic valve replacement (AVR) twice, and tuberculosis (TBM) status post tracheal stent placement.
- He presented status post pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
- The patient has multiple pulmonary issues, including sleep apnea (likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias.
- He also takes multiple narcotics and other medications that could contribute to altered mental status, exacerbating hypoventilation.
- The patient was extubated on day 7 and was well-sating on 4L.
- His sputum culture showed growth of only oropharyngeal flora, which is likely just a colonizer. Therefore, no change in antibiotics has been made.
- If there is a spike or clinical worsening, meropenem will be added for possible extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or Pseudomonas.
- His urine legionella antigen was negative.
- The patient continues to be diuresed to improve respiratory status, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1.5 L daily.
- The patient's renal insufficiency has resolved, with a baseline creatinine of 0.9 to 1.1. His creatinine is already improving with IV fluid resuscitation and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, aortic valve replacement surgery twice, and tuberculosis of the trachea. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest. The patient had multiple comorbidities including sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting, recurrent pneumonias, and chronic use of narcotics.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure, but it has since resolved. The precipitant is unclear, but the patient has multiple pulmonary issues that could contribute to his condition. He is extubated and tolerating 4L of oxygen.

2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient had renal insufficiency, but it has resolved. His baseline creatinine levels were 0.9 to 1.1, and he is now returning to normal ranges. Nephrotoxins are being avoided, and his creatinine trend is being monitored.

3. Cardiac Status: The circumstances surrounding the cardiac arrest are unclear. The patient may have experienced hypercarbia due to chronic respiratory issues and narcotic use, leading to hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Other possible causes include a cardiac event, but the EKG on admission does not show any concerning findings for a myocardial infarction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause"

   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.

   # Renal insufficiency: Resolved. baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per

   shock and arrest, already improving with IVF and resuscitation. Now
   returned to [**Location 810**] range
   - trend creatinine
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, aortic valve replacement twice, and tuberculosis. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has several ongoing health issues, including respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, cardiac status, mental status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic pain, elevated CK levels, and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of multiple pulmonary issues such as sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, recurrent pneumonias, and sputum production. This increases the risk of recurrent respiratory failure.

2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are 0.9 to 1.1, indicating impaired kidney function. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function due to ongoing fluid overload, nephrotoxins, or the effects of shock and arrest.

3. Cardiac Status: The patient has a history of aortic valve replacement and an unclear precipitant for the PEA arrest. The echocardiogram shows moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with probably normal left ventricular systolic function and a high transaortic valve pressure gradient. This suggests possible ongoing cardiac issues, including the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

4. Mental Status: The patient's mental"
