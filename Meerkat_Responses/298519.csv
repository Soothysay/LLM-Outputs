","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of poorly controlled asthma, presenting with respiratory distress. The patient's presentation is atypical for asthma and includes symptoms such as increased respiratory distress, less prominent wheezing, increased arterial-alveolar gradient, and eosinophilia. The differential diagnosis includes infectious sources like strongyloides, abpa, atypical mycobacteria, pcp pna, viral pna, vascular causes including pulmonary embolism, and parenchymal disorders including interstitial lung disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's atypical presentation for asthma exacerbation with increased Aa gradient and peripheral eosinophilia suggests a possible respiratory failure. Further evaluation is required, including checking for strongyloides, performing a PE protocol CT to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, DIP, and occult infection, administering alb/atrovent as needed, and conducting sputum culture.

2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient may also have symptoms of a UTI, which should be assessed by checking urine analysis.

ICU Care:
The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, central venous access through a 20-gauge line, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, stress ulcer prevention with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of poorly controlled asthma who presented with respiratory distress. She was transferred overnight from another hospital unit due to persistent hypoxemia. The patient has been on NIPPV but is now off it. She has allergies to ketorolac, propranolol, and wheezing. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as prednisone 60. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dyspnea. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 109/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200. 

Physical examination shows that the patient is well-nourished with normal eyes/conjunctiva, head/ears/nose/throat, lymphatic system, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory/chest, abdominal, extremities, and skin. Neurological examination was not performed. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and total CO2 levels. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging reveals no infiltrate on chest X-ray.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of poorly controlled asthma. She presented with respiratory distress and was transferred overnight from another hospital unit. She has been off NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) and is currently experiencing hypoxemia. The patient has allergies to ketorolac, propranolol, and wheezing. She is on prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications including prednisone 60.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of asthma, polysubstance abuse, and depression. She is currently admitted to the ICU for an asthma exacerbation. She has been receiving treatment with steroids and bronchodilators, but her condition declined overnight. The patient has been screened for strongyloides antibody and stool test, and a CTA was completed, which showed no pulmonary embolism. However, there are ground-glass opacities in the upper and lower lobes, suggesting an ongoing infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure around 95/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is alert and oriented, but her peripheral pulses are not assessed. Her white blood cell count is elevated at 18.1 K/uL, and her platelet count is slightly low at 385 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function are within normal range. She tested negative for urine toxins, except for methadone. The patient's chest X-ray shows chronic airway disease. The assessment includes hypoxia, asthma exacerbation, and polysubstance abuse/depression. The plan includes weaning off heparin as tolerated, continuing steroids, stacked nebulizers, and obtaining a chest X-ray in the morning"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of substance abuse, asthma, presenting with respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU and is critically ill. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. 

The patient received Ativan for withdrawal symptoms and has allergies to ketorolac, propranolol, and wheezing. The last dose of antibiotics was given on an unspecified date. She is currently receiving various medications including Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, Advair, Celexa, Prednisone, Trileptal, Clonidine, Valium, and Ativan.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 105 bpm (normal range: 66-116 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 101/45 mmHg to 141/73 mmHg (normal range: 82/45-138/88 mmHg), respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. She is receiving supplemental oxygen and her ABG results show a pH of 7.26"

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 9101**] with the ICU team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3012**], whose
   note from today reflects my input.  Treated overnight for withdrawal.
   CT shows some bronchial wall thickening and GGO in a relatively unusual
   pattern.  Remains afebrile and no further episodes of major hypoxemia.
   Assessment and Plan
   42-year-old woman with respiratory distress in the setting of a history
   of asthma and substance abuse.  She has had episodes of severe
   hypoxemia along with wheezing, though these appear to have abated.  The
   hypoxemia seemed to be an unusual presentation for asthma, so we have
   pursued additional testing:
   1) CT excludes PE adequately in this circumstance
   2) CT has clear GGO that may be consistent with infection, COP, or
   other causes
   3) Complete lack of fever makes influenza unlikely
   4) Timing of when she was on steroids (in relationship to her
   eosinophilia) is not completely clear.  The attenuation today argues
   that the report of being on steroids at admission may have been
   inaccurate.
   We will
   - follow up cultures and serologies
   - continue to treat withdrawal (benzodiazepine and opiate)
   - call out to floor
   - ask pulmonary consult team to follow on the floor (?echo with bubble
   to exclude PFO, ?bronch if unimproved)
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3012**]

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of substance abuse and asthma.
- She presents with respiratory failure, which may be due to an asthma exacerbation, organizing pneumonia, or inhalation injury.
- The patient is also experiencing withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepine and opiate abuse.
- She has been treated for withdrawal and is receiving medication for her symptoms.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/45 mmHg to 141/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of asthma and current respiratory failure, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as bronchospasm, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The presence of bronchial wall thickening and ground-glass opacities (GGO) on the CT scan suggests a possible infection, which can lead to pneumonia or other infectious complications.
3. Withdrawal Symptoms: The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepine and opiate abuse. If not managed properly, these symptoms can progress and lead to"
