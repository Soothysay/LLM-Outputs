   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 18yo F with tylenol [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH for possible
   liver transplant.
   # Tylenol OD: LFTs increasing at OSH so was transferred for possible
   liver transplant in anticipation of the labs getting worse given the
   time course of her presentation and the delay in getting NAC. Per the
   Rumack-[**Doctor First Name 1998**] Nomogram she is in the level of probable hepatotoxicity
   based on the APAP level when she presented (119) at 16 hours
   post-ingestion. LFTs improved today.
   - Cte NAC at 325mg/hr until LFTs normalize and clinically stable
   - APAP<10 so no need to follow daily levels
   - Follow Q6H LFTs and lytes as APAP OD can precipitate ARF .
   - F/u hep serologies, HIV
   - Serial neuro exams to eval for encephalopathy
   - F/u liver, transplant, psych recs; transplant SW made aware
   # Psych: Has h/o cutting and was followed by therapist and psychiatrist
   in the past although denies any diagnosis. Was evaluated by the
   psychiatric service at the OSH who felt she had PTSD [**12-31**] the fire and
   was not actually suicidal. The patient seems to have poor insight into
   her actions and its unclear exactly why she took the tylenol although
   she did it exactly one month after the fire so it's likely this
   overdose is related to that event.
   - F/u psych recs
   - Suicidal precautions until psych evaluation
   - SW consult as well for substance abuse (marijuana in urine) and to
   set up with therapist in [**State 395**]
   - Will contact patient's PCP for collateral info on Monday
   # Asthma: Patient has h/o asthma as well as FHx of ""abnormal bronchi""
   in mom and grandparents. Has been smoking since Age 6 and takes
   singulair, flovent, and albuterol at home. When first presented had
   some respiratory distress which rapidly resolved.
   - D/c singulair as hepatically cleared
   - Cont Flovent, albuterol
   - O2 as needed. Currently on RA
   # Pelvic Pain: Unclear etiology. Suspect gas pain. Patient refused
   laxatives and stool softeners. Exam non-concerning.
   - F/U abdominal exams
   - Consider KUB if pain persists or worsens
   - Bowel regimen if she will take it

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for possible liver transplant due to a suspected Tylenol overdose. Her liver function tests (LFTs) have been worsening, but showed improvement today. The patient is currently on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion, which is continued until LFTs normalize and she becomes clinically stable. The APAP level is below 10, so daily levels will no longer be followed. The patient also has a history of asthma, PTSD related to a fire incident, and marijuana use in her urine. She has pelvic pain with an unclear etiology, and her abdominal exam is non-concerning. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is receiving appropriate ICU care including nutrition and prophylaxis measures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's worsening LFTs indicate ongoing liver damage, which can progress to hepatic failure if not managed properly.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of asthma and respiratory distress upon presentation. This could lead to acute respiratory failure if her asthma is not well-controlled.
3. Infection: The patient is in the ICU, where she is at an increased risk of developing infections due to invasive lines and procedures.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's APAP overdose can also affect the kidneys, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or renal failure.
5. Encephalopathy:"

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female who was transferred to the ICU for possible liver transplant due to a suspected Tylenol overdose. She has a history of asthma and substance abuse (marijuana in urine). The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are significantly elevated, indicating probable hepatotoxicity based on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been started at 325mg/hr until LFTs normalize. The patient is also being monitored for potential encephalopathy and follow-up on hep serologies, HIV, and psychiatric evaluation is recommended. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute liver failure: The patient's elevated LFTs and history of Tylenol overdose suggest the possibility of acute liver failure, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the elevated LFTs, the patient is at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status, confusion, and potentially coma.
3. Infection: Immunosuppressive therapy required for liver transplantation increases the risk of infections, such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, or urinary tract infections.
4. Renal failure: Acute liver failure can lead to acute kidney injury due to decreased renal perfusion or complications from sepsis.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of asthma and respiratory distress"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is a Tylenol overdose with evolving hepatotoxicity. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/67 mmHg to 148/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is alert and able to sit up in bed. Physical examination reveals an enlarged left pupil, bradycardia, bilateral chest tube placement, soft abdomen without right upper quadrant tenderness, and no edema in the extremities. Neurological examination shows intact airway reflexes with no asterixis.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine level, decreased total CO2, normal glucose level, prolonged PT/INR, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), normal calcium and magnesium levels, and decreased phosphate level.

Assessment and plan include the patient's history of asthma and psychiatric disease, acute toxic hepatitis due to Tylenol overdose, and the need for ongoing IV N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion. The patient requires frequent monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation profile. A sitter is needed due to the patient's psychiatric history, and social worker and psychiatric consultation are also"

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of Tylenol overdose and evolving hepatotoxicity. The patient's medical history includes asthma, psychiatric disease (including schizophrenia and personality disorders), and a history of alcohol use. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 128/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has been intubated. 

Lab results show elevated levels of AST (2370 U/L) and ALT (1135 U/L), indicating liver injury. The PT/INR is also elevated at 3.4, which suggests impaired blood clotting function. Other lab results include leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 154 K/uL, and an elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient has received IV fluids and blood products. They have been monitored closely with frequent vital sign checks, hemodynamic monitoring, and fluid balance tracking. The patient's renal output and urine output have been noted. The patient's nasogastric tube output has been monitored as well.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient presented with a tylenol overdose and evolving hepatotoxicity. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 128/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals left pupil dilation, right gaze deviation, and mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and abnormal coagulation profile (PTT and INR). The patient has a history of asthma and psychiatric disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatotoxicity: The patient's liver function tests indicate acute toxic hepatitis, likely due to the Tylenol overdose. This can lead to complications such as liver failure, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy.
2. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of psychiatric disease, there is a potential risk of respiratory compromise due to sedation or poor airway protection.
3. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections, particularly pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing blood clots, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented with appropriate prophylaxis.
5. Renal dysfunction: Acute kidney injury may occur due to hypoperfusion or nephrotoxic"

   Assessment and Plan
   18yo F with tylenol [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH for possible liver
   transplant.
   # Tylenol OD: LFTs increasing at OSH so was transferred for possible
   liver transplant in anticipation of the labs getting worse given the
   time course of her presentation and the delay in getting NAC. Per the
   Rumack-[**Doctor First Name 1998**] Nomogram she was in the level of probable hepatotoxicity
   based on the APAP level when she presented (119) at 16 hours
   post-ingestion. LFTs and coags continue to worsen despite appropriate
   NAC dosing here.
   - Follow Q6H LFTs, follow Q12H lytes as can precipitate ARF (this am Cr
   was 0.6)
   - Labs for liver transplant work-up sent per Liver recs
   - CXR, abdominal U/S with Doppler, T&S x 2, HIV ordered per Transplant
   Surgery recs
   - F/u any add
l recs per Liver and Transplant Surgery
   # Psych: Has h/o cutting and was followed by therapist and psychiatrist
   in the past although denies any diagnosis. Was evaluated by the
   psychiatric service at the OSH who felt she had PTSD [**12-31**] the fire and
   was not actually suicidal. Has h/o substance abuse (marijuana in
   urine).
   - Section 12 per psych; cont 1:1 sitter
   - Appreciate psych and SW eval; f/u recs
   - Will contact patient's PCP for collateral info
   # Asthma: Patient has h/o asthma as well as FHx of ""abnormal bronchi""
   in mom and grandparents. Has been smoking since age 6 and takes
   singulair, flovent, and albuterol at home. When first presented had
   some respiratory distress which rapidly resolved. Had another episode
   overnight responding to nebs.
   - Cont flovent, albuterol
   - Singulair held as hepatically cleared
   - Nicotine patch PRN ->does not want one currently

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 18-year-old female with a history of Tylenol overdose and potential liver transplant. The patient's current condition includes worsening liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation profile despite appropriate N-acetylcysteine (NAC) dosing. The patient also has a history of psychiatric issues, including cutting behavior and a previous diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Additionally, the patient has a history of asthma and substance abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of asthma and recent episodes of respiratory distress may lead to acute respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: With the significant elevation in liver enzymes and coagulation profile, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy developing due to liver dysfunction.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The worsening renal function indicated by the elevated BUN and creatinine levels could progress to hepatorenal syndrome, a form of kidney failure secondary to severe liver disease.

4. Infection: Immunosuppression due to liver dysfunction increases the risk of infections, particularly in the ICU setting.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of medications like H2 blockers for stress ulcers poses a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old female with a history of Tylenol overdose, presenting with symptoms of liver failure. She was transferred from another hospital for possible liver transplant. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) have been increasing and coagulation profile is worsening despite appropriate dosing of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The patient's condition is deteriorating rapidly, with nausea, vomiting, elevated liver enzymes, and an increased international normalized ratio (INR). The patient also has a history of asthma and smoking, and she is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the elevated INR and worsening liver function, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and coma.
2. Coagulopathy: The high INR indicates a risk of bleeding due to impaired blood clotting. This can manifest as spontaneous bleeding or prolonged bleeding from minor injuries.
3. Hepatitis: The liver damage may result in hepatitis, characterized by inflammation of the liver. Symptoms may include jaundice, abdominal pain, and fatigue.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation suggest a possibility of ARDS, which can occur in the setting of severe illness or injury.
5. Sepsis: Due to the compromised immune system caused by liver failure, the patient is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of liver failure and Tylenol overdose. The patient reported numbness and tingling throughout her body, chest discomfort, and mild shortness of breath. The EKG showed a junctional rhythm. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6 C, heart rate of 45 bpm, blood pressure of 112/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed an alert patient sitting up in bed, left pupil size of 5 mm, right pupil size of 3 mm, and right lateral gaze deviation. There were no murmurs heard during the cardiovascular examination, and the patient had bilateral chest crepitations. The abdomen was soft with mild right upper quadrant tenderness. No edema was observed during the extremity examination, and the neurologic examination showed the patient to be awake and oriented, with no asterixis.

Laboratory results indicated a low white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels were within normal range. The arterial blood gas showed hypoxemia.

The assessment and plan include bradycardia, history of asthma, and acute toxic hepatitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The potential medical complications that can arise"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 36-year-old female with a chief complaint of liver failure and Tylenol overdose. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently critically ill. The patient's medical history includes asthma, psychiatric disease (including schizophrenia and personality disorders), and acute toxic hepatitis (including alcoholic and acetaminophen-induced).

24-hour events include the patient reporting numbness and tingling throughout her body, as well as chest discomfort and mild shortness of breath. An EKG showed junctional rhythm. The patient's rising bilirubin and liver function tests overnight are concerning for worsening hepatotoxicity.

The patient has no known drug allergies. She has been receiving various medications, including famotidine (Pepcid), and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 45 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/67 to 99/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her temperature is slightly low at 35.6 degrees Celsius.

The patient's physical examination reveals a left pupil that is larger than the right, along with right lateral gaze deviation. There is no evidence of edema. Neurological examination shows no asterixis.

Laboratory results indicate abnormal liver enzymes, elevated lactate levels, low albumin, and significantly elevated LDH. Imaging studies show liver dysfunction.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes brad"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of asthma, psychiatric disease, and acute toxic hepatitis. She was admitted to the ICU due to severe liver injury, altered mental status, and coagulopathy. Her condition has been improving, with improving liver function tests (LFTs) and mental status by the evening of [**2137-5-20**]. Her ultrasound (USG) and trans-thoracic echo (TTE) results were normal. She continues to be monitored closely with frequent checks on her mental status, frequent blood glucose monitoring, and continued N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy. An ethics consult is recommended to assist in decision-making regarding liver transplantation due to unclear self-care abilities post-transplant. Allergy screening is also planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could progress to hepatic encephalopathy if her liver function deteriorates further.
2. Infection: Given her immunocompromised state, the patient is at increased risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, indicating an increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential to prevent bleeding complications.

   liver transplant in anticipation of the labs getting worse given the
   time course of her presentation and the delay in getting NAC. Per the
   Rumack-[**Doctor First Name 1998**] Nomogram she was in the level of probable hepatotoxicity
   based on the APAP level when she presented (119) at 16 hours
   post-ingestion. LFTs and coags now improving.
   - likely passed the acute phase of hepatoxicity given LFT trend (peak
   LFTs 11:40 AM, [**2137-5-20**]

The patient, an 18-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU for possible liver transplant due to a suspected Tylenol overdose. Upon admission, her liver function tests (LFTs) were increasing, indicating probable hepatotoxicity. She received N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to prevent liver damage. Currently, her LFTs and coagulation profile are improving. She has shown improvement in her mental status as well.

The patient has a history of cutting and was previously followed by a therapist and psychiatrist. She was evaluated by psychiatric services and diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to a fire incident. She denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation. Substance abuse history includes marijuana use.

She also has a history of asthma, with a family history of ""abnormal bronchi"" in her mother and grandparents. She smokes and takes Singular, Flovent, and Albuterol at home. She experienced respiratory distress upon presentation and had another episode overnight, responding to nebulizers. She will continue on Flovent and Albuterol, and Singulair is temporarily withheld due to hepatic clearance.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 40s to 70s. Her blood glucose levels are within the normal range. She is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female who was transferred from the outside hospital for a possible liver transplant due to a Tylenol overdose. She presented with increasing liver function tests (LFTs) at the outside hospital, indicating probable hepatotoxicity based on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram. The patient's condition appears to be improving, with improving LFTs and coagulation profile. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 124/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. She has a history of cutting, PTSD, substance abuse (marijuana in urine), asthma, and a family history of ""abnormal bronchi"" in her mother and grandparents. She smokes cigarettes and uses inhalers for asthma. The patient's mental status has improved, and she denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatotoxicity: The patient's history of Tylenol overdose suggests the possibility of ongoing liver damage. Close monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation profile is essential.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of asthma and recent respiratory distress episodes. Monitoring for any signs of respiratory compromise and providing appropriate bronchodilators as needed is important.
3. Infection: Given the patient's immunocom"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 18-year-old female who presented to the hospital with a possible liver transplant due to a Tylenol overdose. She was transferred from another hospital where her liver function tests (LFTs) were increasing, indicating acute hepatic failure. The patient's acetaminophen (Tylenol) level was 119 at 16 hours post-ingestion, which placed her in the probable hepatotoxicity range according to the Rumack-Matthew nomogram. Her LFTs and coagulation profile have improved since then.

The patient's mental status has also improved, and she denies any concerns at the moment. She is asking about advancing her clear liquid diet. The results of her recent ultrasound, trans-thoracic echo, and chest X-ray are all normal.

The patient's blood work shows improving liver enzymes, normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low calcium level. Her kidney function is normal based on her creatinine level.

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient's condition appears to be improving, with improving LFTs and coagulation profile.
2. She will continue to be monitored closely for any changes in her liver function.
3. She will receive further evaluation for liver transplant eligibility.
4. Psychiatric evaluation reveals a history of cutting, substance abuse, and potential PTSD.

","Summary:
The patient is an 18-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for possible liver transplant due to a Tylenol overdose. She presented with acute hepatic failure, but her liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation profile are now improving. The patient's blood glucose levels are well-controlled, and she is being monitored for hypoglycemia. Her mental status has also improved. She has a history of cutting and substance abuse but denies any diagnosis. She is being evaluated by the psychiatric service and will require long-term care planning. The patient's asthma is being managed with inhalers, and smoking cessation counseling has been provided. She is currently stable with a heart rate ranging from 40s to 70s and is asymptomatic. The patient's condition is improving, and she may be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of asthma, which can exacerbate during times of stress or infection. Monitoring her respiratory status and ensuring proper management of her asthma is crucial to prevent acute respiratory failure.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although the patient's mental status has improved, there is still a risk for hepatic encephalopathy due to her liver dysfunction. Regular monitoring of neurologic status and prompt treatment if symptoms arise is important.
3. Hepatitis Rebound: After N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment, there is a possibility"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of psychiatric disease, including schizophrenia and personality disorders, asthma, and acute toxic hepatitis (including alcoholic, acetaminophen, etc.). She is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Key findings and assessments from the note include:

1. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 48 bpm (Sinus Bradycardia), blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.
2. The patient has mild left upper quadrant tenderness on abdominal examination.
3. Neurological examination reveals asterixis, but the rest of the exam is nonfocal.
4. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels, low albumin, and abnormal coagulation profile (PT/PTT/INR). Other lab values such as white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes are within normal ranges.
5. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and other medications including famotidine (Pepcid).
6. The patient's mental status has improved, and she denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.
7. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring, including frequent checks of mental status, liver function tests, and blood glucose levels.
