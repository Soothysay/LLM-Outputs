","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary embolism (PE), and bacteremia. He presented with chest pain and was started on heparin sodium infusion. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/56 mmHg to 117/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a CPAP mask. Fluid balance shows an intake of 523 mL and output of 300 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 523 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and normal troponin T levels. The patient is on various medications including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination were not assessed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE, which is a potential complication that can arise from deep vein thrombosis (DVT). PE can lead to impaired oxygenation and respiratory distress.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of bacteremia, indicating the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. This can"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # CP: per patient, this is similar to previous.  Her EKG shows some
   anterior changes that are nonspecific.  Given her consistent
   presentation with previous CP, doubt myocardial ischemia/injury.
   However, she has risk factors such as very high BMI, so will r/o x 3.
   Her first set was negative.
   - ROMI
   - tele
   .
   # positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers, these cultures may not be real.  However, treatment is
   reasonable until we have data to the contrary and will cover with
   linezolid until we have negative cultures.
   - linezolid
   - blood cultures
   - ECHO for endocarditis
   - urine cultures
   - repeat CXR

   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # CP: per patient, this is similar to previous.  Her EKG shows some
   anterior changes that are nonspecific.  Given her consistent
   presentation with previous CP, doubt myocardial ischemia/injury.
   However, she has risk factors such as very high BMI, so will r/o x 3.
   Her first two sets were negative.
   - ROMI
   - tele
   .
   # positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers, these cultures may not be real.  However, treatment is
   reasonable until we have data to the contrary and will cover with
   linezolid until we have negative cultures.
   - linezolid
   - blood cultures
   - ECHO for endocarditis
   - urine cultures
   - repeat CXR
   .
   # facial erythema: unclear if this is cellulitis vs bruise.  She denies
   trauma to that area of her face.  She does however have a history of
   cellulitis, therefore will treat for now.
   - Linezolid as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was discharged against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1 and presented with chest pain, recent fevers, and documented bacteremia. The patient's current symptoms include chest pain and dyspnea on exertion (DOE). She is on mechanical ventilation in the ICU and has been treated with bipap, CPAP, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial ischemia/injury: The patient's EKG shows some anterior changes that are nonspecific. Although the physician doubts myocardial ischemia/injury based on the consistent presentation, they will rule out myocardial ischemia three times due to the patient's risk factors such as very high BMI.

2. Endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures for staphylococcus simulans and enterococcus, with the latter being resistant to vancomycin. Treatment is being covered with linezolid until negative cultures are obtained, and an echocardiogram for endocarditis is planned.

3. Cellulitis: The patient has facial erythema, which may be cellulitis or a bruise. Given her history of cellulitis, treatment with linezolid is being initiated.

   and had staph species and enterococcus in blood in the setting of PICC
   catheter and was treated with Vanco-->Daptomycin but patient refused
   antibiotics at that time.  Patient then left AMA and was sent to ICU
   after patient arrived to [**Hospital1 19**] [**Hospital Ward Name **] via. Taxi.
   Respiratory Failure--Acute and Chronic failure with obesity
   hypoventilation and diagnosis of reactive airways disease
   -BIPAP worn O/N without exception
   -Treated wtih BIPAP 8/8 which has been well tolerated and should
   continue as settings during sleep and PRN during the day
   -OOB to chair

   -No complaints of dyspnea
   -Bronchodilators
   Bacteremia--Based on known sensitivities patient treated with
   -Linezolid
   -Follow up cultures sent and will review for any positive cultures
   -ECHO this morning which will be limited in quality but will continue
   with antibiotics for 2 week course at minimum
   Cellulitis
Exam with limited findings of cellulitis this morning on
   detailed exam of facial skin.  Will continue to monitor
   Chest Pain-
   -Patient with no evidence of recurrent chest pain overnight
   -ECG reassuring
   -CK's negative
   -Given patient with pain similar in character to that known previous
   patient likely has stable atypical chest pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # CP: per patient, this is similar to previous.  Her EKG shows some
   anterior changes that are nonspecific.  Given her consistent
   presentation with previous CP, doubt myocardial ischemia/injury.
   However, she has risk factors such as very high BMI, so checked 3 sets
   of CE, all were negative.
   -tele while in ED
   .
   # positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to [**Hospital1 3608**] and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers, these cultures may not be real.  Now patient has 2
   cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Echo
   showed no endocarditis, but was limited study.  CXR w/no infiltrate. No
   obvious source for infection
   - continue [**Month/Year (2) 3608**]
   - blood cultures for sensitivities
   - follow fevers, wbc, blood cultures -> if needed, repeat TTE or check
   TEE to r/o endocarditis
   - urine cultures
   .
   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult
   appreciated.
   - team meating: SW, psych, medicine today
   - taper celexa; 40mg today, none tomorrow
   - geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation. Max 40mg/day. Check EKG for QTc
   prolongation.  Aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - check depakote trough
   - psych continued involvement (other recs included crushing meds in
   applesauce, searching belongings for meds in light of prior coding on
   floor due to possible ingestion).
   # hx PE: INR subtherapeutic.  Coumadin was being held for possible
   insertion of PICC at Shattock.  2 doses of 2mg of Coumadin given,
   patient w/sub-therapeutic INR.
   - 5mg coumadin today, re-check INR tomorrow
   - bridge with heparin
   # facial erythema: unclear if this is cellulitis vs bruise.  She denies
   trauma to that area of her face.  She does however have a history of
   cellulitis, therefore will treat for now.  Appears improved, but
   patient on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] may be cause of patient

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was previously admitted to another hospital and left against medical advice (AMA). The patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath (SOB), and has been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus simulans and Enterococcus, which is resistant to vancomycin. The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci, and she has no documented fevers at the moment.

The patient's medical history includes a history of axis I and axis II disorders, for which a psych consult has been appreciated. She is currently being treated with Geodon (ziprasidone) IM every 2 hours for agitation, tapering off citalopram, and stopping Abilify. Her respiratory support includes CPAP mask, and she is being encouraged to use BiPAP. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Endocarditis: Despite the negative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), there is a suspicion of endocarditis due to persistent positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci. A repeat TTE or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be necessary to rule out endocarditis.

2. Infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a positive blood culture for gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and approved linezolid therapy. There are concerns for serotonin syndrome due to citalopram, which is being weaned. The patient's goal oxygen saturation is set at 88-90%. Psychiatric consultation was performed, prescribing Geodon IM as needed for agitation, tapering off celexa, stopping Abilify, and pursuing emergency guardianship. The patient has been ruled out for myocardial infarction three times. Social work consult has been requested. Urine and serum toxicology screens came back negative. The patient is refusing heparin. Allergies include penicillins, Haldol (Oral), Compazine (Oral), Desipramine, Chlorpromazine, Imipramine, Zoloft (Oral), and shellfish-derived substances. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2156-12-22**] 08:50 PM.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished, overweight/obese, and not in acute distress. There is mild erythema over the left maxilla and bruising over the left superior orbit. Cardiovascular examination shows normal PMI, S1, and S2, without S3 or murmurs. Peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, with limited assessment"

   28 yo female with history of obesity and now with recurrent admission
   to ICU with respiratory failure after leaving AMA from outside
   institution.  Her capacity to tolerate BIPAP has been excellent from
   respiratory standpoint and her settings of BIPAP 8/8 have provided full
   support.  Her agitation and poor decision making capcity have led to
   need for pursuit of urgent guardianship.  Psychiatry has been an
   outstanding support for establishment of an effective treatment plan in

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of obesity and recurrent ICU admissions for respiratory failure. She left against medical advice from an outside institution. The patient has been tolerating bipap well, with settings of 8/8 providing full respiratory support. There are concerns about her agitation and poor decision-making capacity, which have led to the need for urgent guardianship. Psychiatry has been involved in establishing an effective treatment plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's history of obesity, recurrent ICU admissions, and pulmonary embolism (PE) increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Bacteremia - The presence of bacteremia can lead to systemic infection and sepsis, which can complicate respiratory failure.
3. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) - OSA can worsen respiratory failure, especially while on bipap support.
4. Poor Glycemic Control - The patient's glucose levels are low (104 mg/dL), indicating the need for close monitoring and management of blood sugar levels.
5. Coagulopathy - The prolonged PTT (50.4 seconds) and elevated INR (1.5) suggest an increased risk of bleeding.
6. Electrolyte Imbalances - The low potassium level (3.9 mEq/L) and magnesium level (1.5 mg/dL) may require correction to maintain normal electrolyte balance.
7. Fluid Balance - The patient's fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of obesity, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and requiring continued BIPAP support. She has a history of bacteremia, DVT/PE, alteration of awareness/agitation, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/53-129/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin, Coumadin, atrovent, BIPAP, and linezolid. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. Imaging shows no vegetations on echocardiogram.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already admitted with respiratory failure and requires continued BIPAP support. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the BIPAP is not effective or if the patient develops any complications such as pneumonia or worsening of underlying conditions like OSA.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT/PE, for which she is currently on Coumad"

   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # CP: per patient, this is similar to previous.  Her EKG shows some
   anterior changes that are nonspecific.  Given her consistent
   presentation with previous CP, doubt myocardial ischemia/injury.
   However, she has risk factors such as very high BMI, so checked 3 sets
   of CE, all were negative.  Now w/one episode of questionable
   ventricular tachycardia yesterday; patient sitting watching TV and
   developed a rhythmic tremor in b/l LE, stated she felt her heart was
   going to explode
 nurse went in when called and saw what looked like
   VT on the monitor. We put the patient on nasal canula oxygen and moved
   the patient to her bed and while she was moving her tremor ceased
   (because she was standing on the affected leg) and she appeared to be
   in sinus on the monitor again. EKG was checked which was no change from
   her baseline. 2 sets of CE were negative. Patients symptoms resolved.

   # positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers, these cultures may not be real.  Now patient has 2
   cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Echo
   showed no endocarditis, but was limited study.  CXR w/no infiltrate. No

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of obesity, admitted with respiratory failure requiring continued BIPAP support. She has shown an excellent response to BIPAP when tolerated. There are no significant fevers or hypotension in the setting of bacteremia. Intermittent hypoxemia has been responsive to O2 and BIPAP. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), bacteremia, chest pain, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and ineffective coping.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not tolerate BIPAP or if there is a further deterioration in oxygenation.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Peripheral Embolism (DVT/PE): The patient's history of DVT/PE increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolization to the lungs or other organs.
3. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia may lead to sepsis if the infection spreads throughout the body, potentially causing organ dysfunction and systemic inflammatory response.
4. Alteration of Awareness/Agitation: The patient's altered mental state and agitation may increase the risk of falls, self-harm, or inadequate care due to impaired decision-making abilities.
5. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient's OSA can lead to recurrent episodes of hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep, which"

   Critcally Ill with tenuous respiratory status and high grade
   bacteremia. Also intermiitent sever agitation making her care quite
   challenging.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of obesity and admitted with respiratory failure. She requires continued BIPAP support and has had an excellent response to it when tolerated. The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), bacteremia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and is currently critically ill with tenuous respiratory status and high-grade bacteremia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is described as tenuous, indicating a high risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE): The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is currently on Coumadin to prevent clot formation. However, there is still a risk of developing another DVT/PE.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not effectively treated.
4. Agitation: The patient is experiencing intermittent severe agitation, which can make her care challenging and increase the risk of injury or complications.
5. Infective Endocarditis: The patient's positive blood cultures may indicate a risk for infective endocarditis, especially if the same organism is identified repeatedly.
6. Epidural Abscess: Considering the patient's history of bacteremia and positive blood cultures, there is a concern for the development"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # CP: per patient, this is similar to previous.  Her EKG shows some
   anterior changes that are nonspecific.  Given her consistent
   presentation with previous CP, doubt myocardial ischemia/injury.
   However, she has risk factors such as very high BMI, so checked 3 sets
   of CE, all were negative.  Now w/one episode of questionable
   ventricular tachycardia [**12-24**]; patient sitting watching TV and
   developed a rhythmic tremor in b/l LE, stated she felt her heart was
   going to explode
 nurse went in when called and saw what looked like
   VT on the monitor. Patient placed on nasal canula oxygen and moved to
   her bed and while she was moving her tremor ceased (because she was
   standing on the affected leg) and she appeared to be in sinus on the
   monitor again. EKG was checked which was no change from her baseline. 2
   sets of CE were negative. Patients symptoms resolved.
   -cont. telemetry monitoring
   -consider cardiology consult
   .
   # positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers, these cultures may not be real.  Now patient has 2
   cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Echo
   showed no endocarditis, but was limited study.  CXR w/no infiltrate. No
   obvious source for infection
   - continue linezolid (day 4)
   - blood cultures for sensitivities
   - follow fevers, wbc, blood cultures
   - TEE to r/o endocarditis tomorrow
   - urine cultures
   .
   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult
   appreciated.
   - Team meating: SW, psych, medicine [**12-24**]. Team to pursue emergency
   guardianship.
   - Celexa tapered, last dose 11/17
   - geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation. Max 40mg/day. Check EKG for QTc
   prolongation.  Aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - psych continued involvement (other recs included crushing meds in
   applesauce, searching belongings for meds in light of prior coding on
   floor due to possible ingestion).
   #diarrhea: Cdiff v antibiotic side effect.  1^st C. diff negative.
   - check Cdiff twice more for 3 total
   - Will treat with immodium
   # hx PE: INR subtherapeutic.  Coumadin was being held for possible
   insertion of PICC at Shattock.  INR from this afternoon 2.7.
   - hold coumadin today
   - check INR tomorrow and restart at 1 mg daily, unless level continues

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # CP: per patient, this is similar to previous.  Her EKG shows some
   anterior changes that are nonspecific.  Given her consistent
   presentation with previous CP, doubt myocardial ischemia/injury.
   However, she has risk factors such as very high BMI, so checked 3 sets
   of CE, all were negative.  Now w/one episode of questionable
   ventricular tachycardia yesterday; patient sitting watching TV and
   developed a rhythmic tremor in b/l LE, stated she felt her heart was
   going to explode
 nurse went in when called and saw what looked like
   VT on the monitor. We put the patient on nasal canula oxygen and moved
   the patient to her bed and while she was moving her tremor ceased
   (because she was standing on the affected leg) and she appeared to be
   in sinus on the monitor again. EKG was checked which was no change from
   her baseline. 2 sets of CE were negative. Patients symptoms resolved.
   -tele while in ED
   -consider cardiology consult
   .
   # positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers, these cultures may not be real.  Now patient has 2
   cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Echo
   showed no endocarditis, but was limited study.  CXR w/no infiltrate. No
   obvious source for infection
   - continue linezolid (day 3)
   - blood cultures for sensitivities
   - follow fevers, wbc, blood cultures -> if needed, repeat TTE or check
   TEE to r/o endocarditis
   - urine cultures
   .
   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult
   appreciated.
   - Team meating: SW, psych, medicine yesterday. Team to pursue emergency
   guardianship.
   - Celexa tapered off
   - geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation. Max 40mg/day. Check EKG for QTc
   prolongation.  Aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - psych continued involvement (other recs included crushing meds in
   applesauce, searching belongings for meds in light of prior coding on
   floor due to possible ingestion).
   #diarrhea: Cdiff v antibiotic side effect
   - check Cdiff
   - if Cdiff negative, can treat with immodium
   -small bolus IVF (250cc) now
   # hx PE: INR subtherapeutic.  Coumadin was being held for possible
   insertion of PICC at Shattock.  INR therapeutic today.
   - 3mg coumadin today, re-check INR tomorrow
   - d/c heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She left against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1 and presented with fevers, recent documentation of bacteremia, and one episode of questionable ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has multiple medical complications including positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus simulans and Enterococcus, which are resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to linezolid and rifampin. She also has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, and there is a plan for a psych consult and emergency guardianship. The patient is also experiencing diarrhea, which may be due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and her INR is subtherapeutic. Other issues include sleep apnea, facial erythema, COPD/asthma, anemia, finger dislocation, and prophylaxis for stress ulcers, DVT, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on a p.o. diet as tolerated and has an 18-gauge PIV line placed on December 24th. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of obesity, admitted with respiratory failure requiring BIPAP support. She has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and bacteremia. She also has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient has shown an excellent response to BIPAP when tolerated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/53 to 123/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's physical examination reveals alertness, clear head and neck examination, decreased chest expansion bilaterally, and obesity with a non-tender abdomen. Extremities show old scars and the right fourth finger in a splint. Neurological examination is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if she does not tolerate BIPAP or oxygen therapy adequately.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE): The patient's history of DVT/PE increases the risk of further clot formation, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Bacteremia: The patient's ongoing bacteremia may lead to sepsis if not appropriately treated.
4. Right Upper Extremity (RUE) Pain: The patient's complaint"

   Disposition :
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old female admitted with respiratory failure and requiring continued BIPAP support. The patient has a history of obesity, pulmonary embolism (PE), bacteremia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/53 to 123/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on CPAP. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 178 kg, and she has a height of 68 inches.

The patient's lab results show hemoglobin at 8.5 g/dL, white blood cell count at 396 K/uL, blood glucose at 88 mg/dL, sodium at 0.6 mg/dL, potassium at 30 mEq/L, chloride at 105 mEq/L, magnesium at 4.3 mEq/L, calcium at 5 mg/dL, and phosphate at 143 mEq/L. The patient's creatinine level is 28.1% and potassium level is 4.9 K/uL.

The patient's assessment includes ineffective coping, H/O PE, H/O bacteremia, chest pain, and OSA. The plan includes continuing Atrovent, BIPAP PRN at night and naps, oxygen while awake, and out-of-bed chair exercises if possible. The patient will continue with Coumadin therapy for DVT/PE, and Linezolid will be continued for bacteremia with follow-up cultures. The patient's alteration in awareness and agitation require psychiatry support and planning, as she is not competent to make current medical decisions and will need urgent guardianship.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further episodes of hypoxemia, potential thromboembolic events, persistent bacteremia, and complications related to the patient's altered mental status."

   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # Unresponsive Episode: .
   # positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers, these cultures may not be real.  Now patient has 2
   cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Echo
   showed no endocarditis, but was limited study.  CXR w/no infiltrate. No
   obvious source for infection
   - continue linezolid (day 4)
   - blood cultures for sensitivities

   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # CP: per patient, this is similar to previous.  Her EKG shows some
   anterior changes that are nonspecific.  Given her consistent
   presentation with previous CP, doubt myocardial ischemia/injury.
   However, she has risk factors such as very high BMI, so checked 3 sets
   of CE, all were negative.  Now w/one episode of questionable
   ventricular tachycardia [**12-24**]; patient sitting watching TV and
   developed a rhythmic tremor in b/l LE, stated she felt her heart was
   going to explode
 nurse went in when called and saw what looked like
   VT on the monitor. Patient placed on nasal canula oxygen and moved to
   her bed and while she was moving her tremor ceased (because she was
   standing on the affected leg) and she appeared to be in sinus on the
   monitor again. EKG was checked which was no change from her baseline. 2
   sets of CE were negative. Patients symptoms resolved.
   -cont. telemetry monitoring
   -consider cardiology consult
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # Unresponsive Episode: Likely from hypoventilation although unclear at
   this time if this was intentional vs. unintentional.  Pt was sleeping
   without bipap; therefore risk of hypercarbia and somnolence is high.
   Painful stimulus unable to provoke a response.  Mental status changes
   likely from underlying psych diagnosis, sleep apnea, hypoventilation
   obesity syndrome, and sedating medications all contributing.
   - likely extubate today (after TEE)
   - avoiding sedating medications
   - bipap at all times while sleeping
   .
   # Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers.  Now patient has 2 cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the
   hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Echo showed no endocarditis, but was
   limited study.  CXR w/no infiltrate. LUE U/S showing partially occluded
   thrombus in cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.
   - continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**12-23**], today is day 5).  Will need to
   treat for 14 days after blood cultures negative
   - continue surveillance blood cultures daily
   - TEE to r/o endocarditis today
   - urine cultures
   .
   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult
   appreciated.
   - Team meating: SW, psych, medicine [**12-24**]. Team to pursue emergency
   guardianship.
   - Celexa tapered, last dose today
   - Geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation. Max 40mg/day. Check EKG for QTc
   prolongation.  Aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - psych continued involvement (other recs included crushing meds in
   applesauce, searching belongings for meds in light of prior coding on
   floor due to possible ingestion).
   #Diarrhea: Cdiff v antibiotic side effect.  1^st C. diff negative.
   - check Cdiff twice more for 3 total
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   - continue abx
   # hx PE: INR subtherapeutic.  Coumadin was being held for possible
   insertion of PICC at Shattock.  INR from this morning 2.6.
   - coumadin 1mg tonight, recheck in AM
   # sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   - pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger dislocation: ortho consulted; will place splint today
   -tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   -OT eval
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: Diflucan x 1 dose today.
   - closely monitor INR given interaction with Coumadin
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated when extubated
   .
   # Access: PIVs, consider PICC  later (not now b/c of positive BCx x2)

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), hypercarbic respiratory failure, and bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and left against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1. The patient presented with fevers, recent documentation of bacteremia, and an unresponsive episode likely due to hypoventilation. She has a positive blood culture for Staphylococcus simulans and Enterococcus, which is resistant to vancomycin. The patient also has a partially occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection. She has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, and psych consultation is appreciated. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and intubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT and PE, and there is a partially occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein, which could potentially lead to further clot formation and embolization to the lungs.
3. Endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures for G+ cocci, and although an echo"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo female with history of obesity and admitted with significant
   bacteremia in the setting of previous indwelling catheters but with
   persistent bactermia seen.  She did have episode of altered mental
   status and concern for for hypercarbia contributing but ABG failed to
   show findings consistent with hypercarbia.  With incapacity to
   establish a responsive state and with concern for worsening hypercarbia
   patient intubated last pm.  This does raise the question of possible
   excess sedation.
   Respiratory Failure-Primarily driven by altered mental status in the
   setting of background change in dosing of pain medications and
   anti-psychotics
   -Wean to PSV
   -Move to SBT when able
   -Will have to maintain minimization of sedating medication dosing
   -Do not see ongoing evolution of new acute pulmonary process at this
   time
   -If unable to maintain stable airway patency will have to consider
   tracheostomy if patient safety at recurrent issue
   Bacteremia-
   -TEE today
   -Will likely need further imaging for epidural collection if unable to
   maintain reassuring exam but no focal signs seen prior to intubation
   and TEE likely to be highest yield study.
   -Linezolid
   -Follow up and repeat cultures today
   -Will have to consider dental source of TEE negative
panorex today.
   Altered Mental Status-
   -Unlikely but remote chance of seizure
   -Will need to minimize dosing of sedating medications
   -Avoid narcotics as possible despite pain
   -Will need to maintain BIPAP support during any period of sleep

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of obesity and admitted with significant bacteremia in the setting of previous indwelling catheters. She experienced an episode of altered mental status and concern for hypercarbia contributing to her respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to her incapacity to establish a responsive state and worsening hypercarbia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, primarily driven by altered mental status in the setting of background change in dosing of pain medications and anti-psychotics. The patient needs to be weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and then move to spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) when able. It is crucial to maintain minimization of sedating medication dosing and ensure stable airway patency. If unable to maintain airway patency, a tracheostomy may be necessary.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has persistent bacteremia despite previous treatment. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered, and further imaging for an epidural collection will be considered if unable to maintain a reassuring exam. The patient will likely need further dental evaluation, including a panorex, to rule out any dental sources of infection.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is unlikely but remote chance of seizure. It is important to minimize dosing of sed"

   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # Unresponsive Episode: Likely from hypoventilation although unclear at
   this time if this was intentional vs. unintentional.  Pt was sleeping
   without bipap; therefore risk of hypercarbia and somnolence is high.
   Painful stimulus unable to provoke a response.  Mental status changes
   likely from underlying psych diagnosis, sleep apnea, hypoventilation
   obesity syndrome, and sedating medications all contributing.
   - likely extubate today (after TEE)
   - avoiding sedating medications
   - bipap at all times while sleeping
   .
   # Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers.  Now patient has 2 cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the
   hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Echo showed no endocarditis, but was
   limited study.  CXR w/no infiltrate. LUE U/S showing partially occluded
   thrombus in cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.
   - continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**12-23**], today is day 5).  Will need to
   treat for 14 days after blood cultures negative
   - continue surveillance blood cultures daily
   - TEE to r/o endocarditis today
   - urine cultures
   .
   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult
   appreciated.
   - Team meating: SW, psych, medicine [**12-24**]. Team to pursue emergency
   guardianship.
   - Celexa tapered, last dose today
   - Geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation. Max 40mg/day. Check EKG for QTc
   prolongation.  Aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - psych continued involvement (other recs included crushing meds in
   applesauce, searching belongings for meds in light of prior coding on
   floor due to possible ingestion).
   #Diarrhea: Cdiff v antibiotic side effect.  1^st C. diff negative.
   - check Cdiff twice more for 3 total
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   - continue abx
   # hx PE: INR subtherapeutic.  Coumadin was being held for possible
   insertion of PICC at Shattock.  INR from this morning 2.6.
   - coumadin 1mg tonight, recheck in AM
   # sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   - pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger dislocation: ortho consulted; will place splint today
   -tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   -OT eval
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: Diflucan x 1 dose today.
   - closely monitor INR given interaction with Coumadin
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated when extubated
   .
   # Access: PIVs, consider PICC  later (not now b/c of positive BCx x2)

   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers.  Now patient has 2 cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the
   hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Difficulties obtaining blood cultures as
   patient is a difficult stick.  TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or
   valvular vegetations.   Nidus of infection is unclear.  CXR w/no
   infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice (AMA) from another hospital. She was admitted with usual care (CP), recent fevers, and bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing difficulties obtaining blood cultures due to being a difficult stick. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations. There are positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus simulans and Enterococcus, with the latter being resistant to vancomycin. The bacteria are sensitive to linezolid and rifampin. The patient has two cultures in the hospital that grew Gram-positive cocci. The nidus of infection is unclear, and a dental panorex has been ordered. The patient also has a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein, which could be a potential nidus of infection. Surveillance blood cultures, follow-up LUE ultrasound, and dental panorex have been planned. The patient is being treated with linezolid for 14 days after blood cultures negative. She has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, and a psych consult is appreciated. The patient received Geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation, with a maximum of 40mg/day. Electrolyte repletion is also being aggressive. The patient has diarrhea, which is likely due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) antibiotic side effect. She will be checked for C. diff twice more, and immodium will be used to treat it. The patient has a superficial thrombus in the left upper extremity, which may serve as a nidus for infection. She is being anticoagulated with Coumadin. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, and the Coumadin dose will be increased to 1.5 mg daily. The patient has a history of sleep apnea, and BiPAP is recommended for her at all times while sleeping. She has anemia with a baseline mid to upper 20s, and serial Hct will be followed. The patient has a finger dislocation, and an ortho consult has been requested for splinting. She will not receive percocet for pain due to sedating side effects. The patient also has a vaginal yeast infection, for which she will receive Diflucan x 1 dose today. She is currently on p.o. diet as tolerated when extubated."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a significant history of chronic ventilatory failure and re-admission to the ICU due to persistent bacteremia. She is currently being treated for a bloodstream infection with Linezolid and has undergone a transesophageal echo, which showed no significant vegetations. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure and agitation. She is on BiPAP 8/8 during sleep, and psychiatry input is appreciated. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, bacteremia, chest pain, obstructive sleep apnea, and impaired skin integrity. She is currently on PO diet for nutrition, receiving systemic anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/43-116/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-33 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 178 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent bacteremia despite treatment, which raises concerns about sepsis. Close monitoring and ongoing antibiotic therapy are essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, and BiPAP support is being provided during sleep. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.

   Patient refused labs this morning.
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers.  Now patient has 2 cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the
   hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Difficulties obtaining blood cultures as
   patient is a difficult stick.  TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or
   valvular vegetations.   Nidus of infection is unclear.  CXR w/no
   infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially
   occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.  LUE
   ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex obtained yesterday, awaiting
   read.
   - continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**12-23**], today is day 7).  Will need to
   treat for 14 days after blood cultures negative
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   - f/u dental panorex
   .
   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  1^st dose of geodon given
   evening of [**12-27**].  Patient received additional geodon on [**12-28**] and
   [**12-29**].  Guardianship paperwork has been completed by the medical &
   psychiatry teams and is in the hands of the legal department.
   - Geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation. Max 40mg/day. Check EKG for QTc
   prolongation.  Aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - psych continued involvement (other recs included crushing meds in
   applesauce, searching belongings for meds in light of prior coding on
   floor due to possible ingestion).
   Events during the day: This morning after refusing to talk with the
   entire medical team on morning rounds the patient left her room and
   walked out of the unit, threatening to leave the hospital.  The medical
   team tried to talk her down, but she threatened to hurt others and to
   persist in leaving.  A code purple was called and security escorted the
   patient back to her room and the patient went back to bed.
   Around 1 pm the intern on call was called to the patient
s room by
   nursing staff because of agitation.  The patient was given a time-out
   and after 5 minutes she requested to speak with the physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   agreed to go to IR for PICC placement if the physician on call would
   call plastics regarding her hand and speak with her later in the
   evening.  This agreement was made and the patient went to IR.
   Around 5 pm the intern on call went to the patient
s room after
   multiple requests from the patient to speak with the physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   intern went to the patient
s bedside and told the patient that
   plastics
 recommendation for her hand remained the splint as they had
   told her yesterday afternoon and that a hard cast was not clinically
   indicated.  The patient became agitated again, raising her voice and
   stating that she was refusing all medical treatments including PICC
   line placement, linezolid treatment, and CPAP.  She requested to be
   transported to another hospital.  The intern reinforced her desire to
   care for the patient and deal with her medical problems and offered the
   patient a time-out, which the patient refused.  The patient then ripped
   the IV out of her hand.  The intern left the patient
s room to give her
   a chance to calm down.  The patient removed all of her monitoring,
   including O2 sat monitor and started to get out of bed.  A code purple
   was called.  Psychiatry and the psychiatric nurse and nurse supervisor
   all came.  A combination of trying to talk down the patient and
   time-outs were attempted.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3573**] from psychiatry was also
   called and informed.  He was unable to see the patient but stated that
   he was completing a draft behavioral plan in OMR.  Security was
   eventually dismissed and the psychiatric nurse and on call intern
   continued to dialogue with the patient.  The patient continued to
   refuse all medical treatments.
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3569**] became increasingly agitated and threatening and another
   code purple was called.  During this period she hit her right hand on
   the side of the bed and complained of hand pain.  Security came into
   the room and the patient became increasingly agitated.  The intern on
   call asked security to step out, examined the hand, and attempted to
   bargain with the patient regarding BiPAP and O2 sat monitoring by
   offering more pain medication, however, the patient refused.  The
   patient eventually calmed down, security was dismissed, and the
   psychiatric nurse continued to dialogue with the patient.  A code blue
   was called overhead and the intern had to leave the unit.
   Shortly after returning to the unit the intern was informed by a nurse
   that the patient was complaining of chest and abdominal pain and
   generally feeling unwell, however, the patient told the nurse that she
   was refusing EKGs and lab draws.
   While the on call intern was seeing another patient security had to be
   called again as the patient had walked out of her room and out of the
   unit into the hallway.  Nursing staff had followed the patient into the
   hallway while awaiting security arrival.  The patient physically hit 2
   of the nursing staff and spit in the face of one of the nurses.
   Security had to wheel the patient back into her room and bed.  Geodon
   10 mg IM was given.  The patient refused to lay down in bed and stop
   yelling and had to be forcibly placed in 4 point restraints for the
   safety of both the staff and the patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, DVT/PE, recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice from Hospital1. She has been experiencing recent fevers and documented bacteremia. The patient has been difficult to manage, with episodes of agitation, refusal to participate in care, and violent behavior. She has also demonstrated poor compliance with medical treatments, including not wearing her BiPAP and refusing antibiotics. The patient's medical conditions include COPD/asthma, anemia, finger subluxation, vaginal yeast infection, and prophylaxis for stress ulcers and VAP. She is currently on a p.o. diet as tolerated and requires a PICC line placement tomorrow. Her current vital signs are within normal limits, but she has been experiencing intermittent chest and abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has documented bacteremia and a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein, which may serve as a nidus for infection. She is already being treated with linezolid for the bacteremia, but there is a possibility of developing further infections due to her compromised immune system and refusal to comply with antibiotic treatment.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient has a superficial thrombus in the left upper extremity, there is still a risk of developing a DVT due to her history of D"

   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers.  Now patient has 2 cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the
   hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Difficulties obtaining blood cultures as
   patient is a difficult stick.  TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or
   valvular vegetations.   Nidus of infection is unclear.  CXR w/no
   infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially
   occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.
   Dental panorex ordered.  LUE ultrasound ordered

The patient presented with a re-subluxed finger and increasing agitation and anxiety. She accepted 20mg of PO Geodon but escalated when informed that plastic surgery would not see her that night. The patient demanded to be 4-point restrained and attempted to leave when denied. Code purple was called twice, and psychiatry was called to help. The patient was given 10mg IM Geodon and put in restraints after bargaining with psych. No deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was found through upper extremity ultrasound. A Panorex is pending, and the patient is scheduled for a PICC tomorrow and a cast for her hand. Allergies are listed, including penicillins, Haldol, Compazine, Desipramine, Chlorpromazine, Imipramine, Zoloft, and shellfish-derived products. The last dose of antibiotics was not specified. The patient is currently on infusions and other ICU medications, with changes made to her medical and family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the finger issue. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6C (99.7F), heart rate of 87 bpm with a range of 81-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/60 mmHg to 136/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute with a range of 10-39 breaths per minute,"

","The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with her usual chief complaint of difficulty breathing and left AMA from Hospital1. The patient has been experiencing recent fevers and bacteremia with positive blood cultures showing Staphylococcus simulans and Enterococcus, which is resistant to vancomycin. The bacteria are sensitive to linezolid and rifampin.

The patient has two cultures in the hospital that grew gram-positive cocci. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations. The source of infection is unclear. A chest X-ray showed no infiltrate. Urine culture was negative. Right upper extremity (RUE) ultrasound revealed a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein, which could be a potential nidus of infection. Dental panorex and left upper extremity (LUE) ultrasound are ordered.

The patient's psychosocial history includes axis I and axis II disorders. Psychiatric consultation is appreciated, and she has been given Geodon 20mg orally. The team meeting discussed emergency guardianship paperwork, and the patient is currently receiving aggressive electrolyte repletion. Psychiatric involvement continues, including recommendations such as crushing medications in applesauce and searching for hidden medications due to"

   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  1^st dose of geodon given
   evening of [**12-27**].  Patient received additional geodon on [**12-28**] and
   [**12-29**].  Guardianship paperwork has been completed by the medical &

   - Geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation. Max 40mg/day. Check EKG for QTc
   prolongation.  Aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - psych continued involvement (other recs included crushing meds in
   applesauce, searching belongings for meds in light of prior coding on

   Events during the day: This morning after refusing to talk with the
   entire medical team on morning rounds the patient left her room and
   walked out of the unit, threatening to leave the hospital.  The medical
   team tried to talk her down, but she threatened to hurt others and to
   persist in leaving.  A code purple was called and security escorted the
   patient back to her room and the patient went back to bed.
   Around 1 pm the intern on call was called to the patient
s room by
   nursing staff because of agitation.  The patient was given a time-out
   and after 5 minutes she requested to speak with the physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   agreed to go to IR for PICC placement if the physician on call would
   call plastics regarding her hand and speak with her later in the
   evening.  This agreement was made and the patient went to IR.
   Around 5 pm the intern on call went to the patient
s room after
   multiple requests from the patient to speak with the physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   intern went to the patient
s bedside and told the patient that
   plastics
 recommendation for her hand remained the splint as they had
   told her yesterday afternoon and that a hard cast was not clinically
   indicated.  The patient became agitated again, raising her voice and
   stating that she was refusing all medical treatments including PICC
   line placement, linezolid treatment, and CPAP.  She requested to be
   transported to another hospital.  The intern reinforced her desire to
   care for the patient and deal with her medical problems and offered the
   patient a time-out, which the patient refused.  The patient then ripped
   the IV out of her hand.  The intern left the patient
s room to give her
   a chance to calm down.  The patient removed all of her monitoring,
   including O2 sat monitor and started to get out of bed.  A code purple
   was called.  Psychiatry and the psychiatric nurse and nurse supervisor
   all came.  A combination of trying to talk down the patient and
   time-outs were attempted.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3573**] from psychiatry was also
   called and informed.  He was unable to see the patient but stated that
   he was completing a draft behavioral plan in OMR.  Security was
   eventually dismissed and the psychiatric nurse and on call intern
   continued to dialogue with the patient.  The patient continued to
   refuse all medical treatments.  The patient stated that she would
   rather die from bacteremia, bleeding, or lack of oxygen rather than
   accept antibiotics, PICC line placement, or BiPAP/CPAP treatments.
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3569**] became increasingly agitated and threatening and another
   code purple was called.  During this period she hit her right hand on
   the side of the bed and complained of hand pain.  Security came into
   the room and the patient became increasingly agitated.  The intern on
   call asked security to step out, examined the hand, and attempted to
   bargain with the patient regarding BiPAP and O2 sat monitoring by
   offering more pain medication, however, the patient refused.  The
   patient expressed concern regarding her hand and was reassured that
   there did not appear to be a fracture, but that the patient was too
   unstable to have further evaluation at this time.  She was offered an
   ice pack to help with pain and swelling and this was refused.  The
   patient eventually calmed down, security was dismissed, and the
   psychiatric nurse continued to dialogue with the patient.  A code blue
   was called overhead and the intern had to leave the unit.
   Shortly after returning to the unit the intern was informed by a nurse
   that the patient was complaining of chest and abdominal pain and
   generally feeling unwell, however, the patient told the nurse that she
   was refusing EKGs and lab draws.
   While the on call intern was seeing another patient security had to be
   called again as the patient had walked out of her room and out of the
   unit into the hallway.  Nursing staff had followed the patient into the
   hallway while awaiting security arrival.  The patient physically hit 2
   of the nursing staff and spit in the face of one of the nurses.
   Security had to wheel the patient back into her room and bed.  Geodon
   10 mg IM was given.  The patient refused to lay down in bed and stop
   yelling and had to be forcibly placed in 4 point restraints for the
   safety of both the staff and the patient.  The patient continued to
   refuse BiPAP and all other medical treatments.
   Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 837**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3747**] from psychiatry eventually came up to the unit to
   evaluate the patient.  She also talked with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3573**] by telephone
   regarding the patient
s current situation and it was decided that if it
   was necessary to chemically restrain the patient that benzos could be
   used and that if necessary (due to benzo use or refusal to wear BiPAP)
   intubation may be necessary.

   # Dispo: ICU
 the patient requires too much care for the general
   medical floor to handle as her psychiatric disease is not controlled
   and she routinely becomes agitated and refuses to participate in her
   care, even when it comes to potentially life-threatening issues such as
   wearing her BiPAP, taking linezolid for her bacteremia, and refusing
   lab draws to monitor her INR while on warfarin.  Her behavior
   consistently demonstrates that she is not competent to make decisions
   regarding her care.  As demonstrated over the course of the past 24
   hours, the patient is not only a threat to herself, but also to staff
   and to other patients within the ICU as the attention she demands has
   the potential to compromise the care of other patients.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, DVT/PE, recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving AMA from Hospital1. She has been admitted with recent fevers and documentation of bacteremia. The patient has multiple allergies and is currently being treated with linezolid for bacteremia. She is also on prophylactic medications such as Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, and bowel regimen. The patient has refused all medical treatments including antibiotics, PICC line placement, and BiPAP. She has become agitated and threatening, hitting her right hand on the side of the bed, and complaining of hand pain. She has also been physically aggressive towards nursing staff. She is currently in 4-point restraints due to her agitation and refusal to participate in care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has bacteremia and a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein, which may serve as a nidus for infection. She also has a history of DVT/PE and is at risk for further thromboembolic events.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure and has refused to wear BiPAP, which increases her risk for respiratory failure.
3. Agitation and Psychiatric Disturbance: The patient's psychiatric condition is not well-controlled, leading to frequent episodes of agitation and"

   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.

   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  Geodon 10 mg IM given x 2
   yesterday.  Ativan was not needed.  As patient has physically harmed
   medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) this morning, she will need to
   remain in restraints with a sitter and have security present if/when
   she comes out of restraints.  Will need to consider foley placement if
   she continues to soil herself to spite staff.

   # Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   obtained read pending.  On reviewing the medication administration
   record, the patient has only been getting one dose of linezolid per day
   for the last few days (instead of two).  This pattern is concerning for
   possible development of antibiotic resistance.   As the patient is
   refusing oral medication, will need to place a PICC line and can likely
   treat with vancomycin given culture data here.
   - PICC line placement today with initiation of vancomycin treatment.
   - If unable to get PICC placement, continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**12-23**],
   today is day 8) today.  Will need to treat for 14 days after blood
   cultures negative

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She left against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1 with complaints of fevers and bacteremia. The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders and is currently refusing necessary medical treatments, including IV access and antibiotics. She is physically harming medical team members and requires restraints with a sitter and security presence. The patient also soils herself intentionally and may need a Foley placement if this continues. 

Medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus simulans and Enterococcus, with the latter being resistant to vancomycin. There is also a possibility of a nidus of infection in the right upper extremity (RUE) due to a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein. 
2. Antibiotic resistance: The patient has only been receiving one dose of linezolid per day instead of the prescribed two, which could lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Endocarditis: Although the TEE echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations, the presence of bacteremia and possible nidus of infection raises concern for potential endocarditis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers.  Now patient has 2 cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the
   hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Difficulties obtaining blood cultures as
   patient is a difficult stick.  TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or
   valvular vegetations.   Nidus of infection is unclear.  CXR w/no
   infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially
   occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.  LUE
   ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex obtained yesterday, awaiting
   read.
   - continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**12-23**], today is day 7).  Will need to
   treat for 14 days after blood cultures negative
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   - f/u dental panorex
   .
   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  1^st dose of geodon given
   evening of [**12-27**].  Patient received additional geodon on [**12-28**] and
   [**12-29**].  Guardianship paperwork has been completed by the medical &
   psychiatry teams and is in the hands of the legal department.
   - Geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation. Max 40mg/day. Check EKG for QTc
   prolongation.  Aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - psych continued involvement (other recs included crushing meds in
   applesauce, searching belongings for meds in light of prior coding on
   floor due to possible ingestion).
   Events during the day: This morning after refusing to talk with the
   entire medical team on morning rounds the patient left her room and
   walked out of the unit, threatening to leave the hospital.  The medical
   team tried to talk her down, but she threatened to hurt others and to
   persist in leaving.  A code purple was called and security escorted the
   patient back to her room and the patient went back to bed.
   Around 1 pm the intern on call was called to the patient
s room by
   nursing staff because of agitation.  The patient was given a time-out
   and after 5 minutes she requested to speak with the physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   agreed to go to IR for PICC placement if the physician on call would
   call plastics regarding her hand and speak with her later in the
   evening.  This agreement was made and the patient went to IR.
   Around 5 pm the intern on call went to the patient
s room after
   multiple requests from the patient to speak with the physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   intern went to the patient
s bedside and told the patient that
   plastics
 recommendation for her hand remained the splint as they had
   told her yesterday afternoon and that a hard cast was not clinically
   indicated.  The patient became agitated again, raising her voice and
   stating that she was refusing all medical treatments including PICC
   line placement, linezolid treatment, and CPAP.  She requested to be
   transported to another hospital.  The intern reinforced her desire to
   care for the patient and deal with her medical problems and offered the
   patient a time-out, which the patient refused.  The patient then ripped
   the IV out of her hand.  The intern left the patient
s room to give her
   a chance to calm down.  The patient removed all of her monitoring,
   including O2 sat monitor and started to get out of bed.  A code purple
   was called.  Psychiatry and the psychiatric nurse and nurse supervisor
   all came.  A combination of trying to talk down the patient and
   time-outs were attempted.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3573**] from psychiatry was also
   called and informed.  He was unable to see the patient but stated that
   he was completing a draft behavioral plan in OMR.  Security was
   eventually dismissed and the psychiatric nurse and on call intern
   continued to dialogue with the patient.  The patient continued to
   refuse all medical treatments.  The patient stated that she would
   rather die from bacteremia, bleeding, or lack of oxygen rather than
   accept antibiotics, PICC line placement, or BiPAP/CPAP treatments.
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3569**] became increasingly agitated and threatening and another
   code purple was called.  During this period she hit her right hand on
   the side of the bed and complained of hand pain.  Security came into
   the room and the patient became increasingly agitated.  The intern on
   call asked security to step out, examined the hand, and attempted to
   bargain with the patient regarding BiPAP and O2 sat monitoring by
   offering more pain medication, however, the patient refused.  The
   patient expressed concern regarding her hand and was reassured that
   there did not appear to be a fracture, but that the patient was too
   unstable to have further evaluation at this time.  She was offered an
   ice pack to help with pain and swelling and this was refused.  The
   patient eventually calmed down, security was dismissed, and the
   psychiatric nurse continued to dialogue with the patient.  A code blue
   was called overhead and the intern had to leave the unit.
   Shortly after returning to the unit the intern was informed by a nurse
   that the patient was complaining of chest and abdominal pain and
   generally feeling unwell, however, the patient told the nurse that she
   was refusing EKGs and lab draws.
   While the on call intern was seeing another patient security had to be
   called again as the patient had walked out of her room and out of the
   unit into the hallway.  Nursing staff had followed the patient into the
   hallway while awaiting security arrival.  The patient physically hit 2
   of the nursing staff and spit in the face of one of the nurses.
   Security had to wheel the patient back into her room and bed.  Geodon
   10 mg IM was given.  The patient refused to lay down in bed and stop
   yelling and had to be forcibly placed in 4 point restraints for the
   safety of both the staff and the patient.  The patient continued to
   refuse BiPAP and all other medical treatments.
   Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 837**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3747**] from psychiatry eventually came up to the unit to
   evaluate the patient.  She also talked with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3573**] by telephone
   regarding the patient
s current situation and it was decided that if it
   was necessary to chemically restrain the patient that benzos could be
   used and that if necessary (due to benzo use or refusal to wear BiPAP)
   intubation may be necessary.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus simulans and enterococcus, which are resistant to vancomycin. The patient is currently being treated with linezolid and rifampin. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen if necessary.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein of the right upper extremity, which could potentially lead to a DVT. Anticoagulation therapy with coumadin has been initiated.

3. Sleep apnea: The patient has a history of somnolence due to hypercarbia and subsequent intubation when not using BiPAP. It is crucial for the patient to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping to prevent respiratory compromise.

4. COPD/Asthma: The patient has a history of COPD/asthma and requires nebs/inhalers for management. Ensuring proper control of her respiratory condition is essential to prevent exacerbations.

5. Anemia: The patient has a baseline hematocrit (Hct) in the mid to upper 20s. Serial Hct monitoring should be conducted to track any changes in her blood count.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resisant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  As she has no documented fevers, and she currently is
   without fevers.  Now patient has 2 cultures ([**12-22**] and [**12-23**]) in the
   hospital that grew G+ cocci.  Difficulties obtaining blood cultures as
   patient is a difficult stick.  TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or
   valvular vegetations.   Nidus of infection is unclear.  CXR w/no
   infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially
   occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.  LUE
   ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex obtained yesterday, awaiting
   read.
   - continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**12-23**], today is day 7).  Will need to
   treat for 14 days after blood cultures negative
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   - f/u dental panorex
   .
   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  1^st dose of geodon given
   evening of [**12-27**].  Patient received additional geodon on [**12-28**] and
   [**12-29**].  Guardianship paperwork has been completed by the medical &
   psychiatry teams and is in the hands of the legal department.
   - Geodon 10mg IM Q2 hour PRN agitation. Max 40mg/day. Check EKG for QTc
   prolongation.  Aggressive electrolyte repletion.
   - psych continued involvement (other recs included crushing meds in
   applesauce, searching belongings for meds in light of prior coding on
   floor due to possible ingestion).
   Events during the day: This morning after refusing to talk with the
   entire medical team on morning rounds the patient left her room and
   walked out of the unit, threatening to leave the hospital.  The medical
   team tried to talk her down, but she threatened to hurt others and to
   persist in leaving.  A code purple was called and security escorted the
   patient back to her room and the patient went back to bed.
   Around 1 pm the intern on call was called to the patient
s room by
   nursing staff because of agitation.  The patient was given a time-out
   and after 5 minutes she requested to speak with the physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   agreed to go to IR for PICC placement if the physician on call would
   call plastics regarding her hand and speak with her later in the
   evening.  This agreement was made and the patient went to IR.
   Around 5 pm the intern on call went to the patient
s room after
   multiple requests from the patient to speak with the physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   intern went to the patient
s bedside and told the patient that
   plastics
 recommendation for her hand remained the splint as they had
   told her yesterday afternoon and that a hard cast was not clinically
   indicated.  The patient became agitated again, raising her voice and
   stating that she was refusing all medical treatments including PICC
   line placement, linezolid treatment, and CPAP.  She requested to be
   transported to another hospital.  The intern reinforced her desire to
   care for the patient and deal with her medical problems and offered the
   patient a time-out, which the patient refused.  The patient then ripped
   the IV out of her hand.  The intern left the patient
s room to give her
   a chance to calm down.  The patient removed all of her monitoring,
   including O2 sat monitor and started to get out of bed.  A code purple
   was called.  Psychiatry and the psychiatric nurse and nurse supervisor
   all came.  A combination of trying to talk down the patient and
   time-outs were attempted.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3573**] from psychiatry was also
   called and informed.  He was unable to see the patient but stated that
   he was completing a draft behavioral plan in OMR.  Security was
   eventually dismissed and the psychiatric nurse and on call intern
   continued to dialogue with the patient.  The patient continued to
   refuse all medical treatments.  The patient stated that she would
   rather die from bacteremia, bleeding, or lack of oxygen rather than
   accept antibiotics, PICC line placement, or BiPAP/CPAP treatments.
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3569**] became increasingly agitated and threatening and another
   code purple was called.  During this period she hit her right hand on
   the side of the bed and complained of hand pain.  Security came into
   the room and the patient became increasingly agitated.  The intern on
   call asked security to step out, examined the hand, and attempted to
   bargain with the patient regarding BiPAP and O2 sat monitoring by
   offering more pain medication, however, the patient refused.  The
   patient expressed concern regarding her hand and was reassured that
   there did not appear to be a fracture, but that the patient was too
   unstable to have further evaluation at this time.  She was offered an
   ice pack to help with pain and swelling and this was refused.  The
   patient eventually calmed down, security was dismissed, and the
   psychiatric nurse continued to dialogue with the patient.  A code blue
   was called overhead and the intern had to leave the unit.
   Shortly after returning to the unit the intern was informed by a nurse
   that the patient was complaining of chest and abdominal pain and
   generally feeling unwell, however, the patient told the nurse that she
   was refusing EKGs and lab draws.
   While the on call intern was seeing another patient security had to be
   called again as the patient had walked out of her room and out of the
   unit into the hallway.  Nursing staff had followed the patient into the
   hallway while awaiting security arrival.  The patient physically hit 2
   of the nursing staff and spit in the face of one of the nurses.
   Security had to wheel the patient back into her room and bed.  Geodon
   10 mg IM was given.  The patient refused to lay down in bed and stop
   yelling and had to be forcibly placed in 4 point restraints for the
   safety of both the staff and the patient.  The patient continued to
   refuse BiPAP and all other medical treatments.
   Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 837**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3747**] from psychiatry eventually came up to the unit to
   evaluate the patient.  She also talked with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3573**] by telephone
   regarding the patient
s current situation and it was decided that if it
   was necessary to chemically restrain the patient that benzos could be
   used and that if necessary (due to benzo use or refusal to wear BiPAP)
   intubation may be necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She left against medical advice from Hospital1 with her usual chief complaint and was admitted to the ICU due to recent fevers and documented bacteremia.

The patient has been difficult to manage, with multiple incidents of agitation, refusal of medical treatments, and threatening behavior. She has been given Geodon IM for agitation and has had several code purples and code blues due to her behavior. She has also ripped out her IV and removed her monitoring devices.

Medical Complications:
1. Positive blood cultures: The patient has documented bacteremia with Staph simulans and enterococcus, which is resistant to vancomycin. The bacteria are sensitive to linezolid and rifampin.
2. Thrombus in cephalic vein: A partially occluded thrombus was found in the patient's right upper extremity cephalic vein, which could be a potential nidus for infection.
3. Chest pain and abdominal pain: The patient complained of chest and abdominal pain, but refused EKGs and lab draws.
4. Diarrhea: The patient had diarrhea, initially thought to be Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, but subsequent tests were negative. Another stool test is pending.
5. Sleep apnea: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo female with significant respiratory failure in the setting of
   obesity hypoventilation and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She has
   reasonable stability of ventilatory support with BIPAP 8/8
   demonstrating good effect in terms of maintaining ventilation and
   oxygenation.  She has had continued spitting at and attacking of staff
   throughout her time last night--this represents an unacceptable level
   of threat and violence making the environment unsafe for staff
   attempting to provide medial care to the staff.  In addition, it has
   made our capacity to maintain medical care for her unaccaptable with
   physical refusal of care.  We do, however, have guardianship [**Name2 (NI) 3765**]
   on an emergency basis and will continue to provide necessary medical
   care in an environment that allows adequate medical care and a safe
   environment for out care staff of nurses and physicians.
   1)Endocarditis-
   -Will follow up blood cultures to establish the evidence for a
   persistenc or absence of persistent bacteremia
   -Will continue Linezolid at current dosing
   -Encouragingly we have seen an absence of fevers
   -Will check dental panorex film today
   -Patient refusing antibiotics today--will have to clarify patient
   current legal status/compentence
   2)Bipolar Disorder-
   -Continue with Geodon dosing
   -Will continue to have standing sitter to continue and security for any
   time she is out of restraints
   -Psychiatry will provide support in team meeting this afternoon with
   guidance on the alternative interventions they have to offer
   -Will clarify with legal the status of her guardianship to consider
   placment of IV catheter against her will.
   -Sedation as needed
   3)DVT-
   -Comadin to continue
   -INR needed but blood draw refused
   -Will need blood draw to titrate therapy

She is currently on BIPAP 8/8, which seems to be maintaining her ventilation and oxygenation. However, the patient has been displaying violent behavior, attacking staff members, and spitting at them. This behavior poses a threat to both the patient and the medical staff, making it difficult to provide adequate care.

The patient has a history of endocarditis, bipolar disorder, and DVT. She is currently refusing antibiotics, and her legal status and competence need to be clarified. She is also refusing blood draws, which is necessary for monitoring her INR levels to titrate her anticoagulant therapy. The patient's impaired skin integrity and fungal infection require attention, as well as her pain control, ineffective coping strategies, and chronic obstructive sleep apnea.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) management need to be addressed. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently admitted to the ICU."

   Continues to complain of L shoulder pain, burning at PICC line site
   Team meeting with psych, pt is requesting a copy of treatment plan
   Coumadin dose increased to 3mg qday
   Dental to see pt in AM
   At 6:30 AM this morning, pt was noted to be unresponsive by nursing.  A
   resident, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3794**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1872**], went to evaluate patient.  She was not
   responding to verbal stimuli and not responding to nailbed pressure or
   sternal rub.  When assessing muscle tone, arm had some tone, not
   completely flaccid.  When dropping her arm, it did not fall limply.
   Discussion in the room was centered around a particular nurse ( a
   favorite of hers)  not being able to care for Ms. [**Known lastname **] if she was
   unresponsive today.  After 1-2 minutes, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3795**] on her own.
   She complained of some confusion and asked which hospital she was in.
   She was otherwise hemodynamically stable with O2 sats in the 90s.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   # Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  Geodon 10 mg IM given x 2
   yesterday.  Ativan was not needed.  As patient has physically harmed
   medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) this morning, she will need to
   remain in restraints with a sitter and have security present if/when
   she comes out of restraints.  Will need to consider foley placement if
   she continues to soil herself to spite staff.
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department;
   attempting to contact them regarding progress.
   - Needs EKG & electrolytes today after receiving Geodon last night.
   - Will review past psych recommendations and discuss in team meeting
   today.  Some recommendations (med crushing, no silverware) have not
   been routinely followed.  Need to be consistent with patient and will
   post treatment plan for all staff to review before participating in
   patient
s care.
   # Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   obtained read pending.  On reviewing the medication administration
   record, the patient has only been getting one dose of linezolid per day
   for the last few days (instead of two).  This pattern is concerning for
   possible development of antibiotic resistance.   As the patient is
   refusing oral medication, will need to place a PICC line and can likely
   treat with vancomycin given culture data here.
   - PICC line placement today with initiation of vancomycin treatment.
   - If unable to get PICC placement, continue Linezolid (day #1 = [**12-23**],
   today is day 8) today.  Will need to treat for 14 days after blood
   cultures negative
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   - f/u dental panorex
   .
   .
   # sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   - pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  Last night the
   patient refused to wear her BiPAP and it had to be forcibly placed
   while she was in restraints.
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain after
   being placed in restraints last night and continues to complain of the
   same today.  Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is
   real.  Will consider performing x-ray imaging to rule out dislocation
   when patient is more stable to be off restraints for x-ray.  Security
   will need to be on hand.
   .
   #Diarrhea: More likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 2.
   - check 3^rd C. diff.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   - continue abx
   # hx PE: Will continue coumadin dose at 1.5 mg daily and attempt to
   obtain labs today after PICC placement.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR today.  Patient is difficult to
   obtain peripheral access from.
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Based on her poor insight and irrational and reactive
   behavior, patient is not deemed capable of making medical decisions.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give her IM Geodon if she becomes agitated and
   aggressive.  Droperidol and Ativan are also options for acute agitation
   if needed.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Geodon 10mg IM for
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   obtained read pending.  On reviewing the medication administration
   record, the patient has only been getting one dose of linezolid per day
   for the last few days (instead of two) because of mediation refusal.
   This pattern is concerning for possible development of antibiotic
   resistance, and this has been explained to the patient.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.
   - PICC line placement yesterday, continue Linezolid for 14 days until
   last negative blood culture (currently [**12-23**] which would make final
   dose on [**1-5**])
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   .
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   - pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  Last night the
   patient refused to wear her BiPAP and it had to be forcibly placed
   while she was in restraints.
   .
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain after
   being placed in restraints last night and continues to complain of the
   same today.  Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real.
   Patient has full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this
   point.
   .
   #Diarrhea: More likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 2.
   - check 3^rd C. diff.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.
   - continue abx
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.
   - heparin gtt until patient takes meds regularly and INR is
   therapeutic.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR yesterday.
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Based on her poor insight and irrational and reactive
   behavior, patient is not deemed capable of making medical decisions.

   yesterday.  Ativan was not needed.  As patient has physically harmed
   medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) this morning, she will need to
   remain in restraints with a sitter and have security present if/when
   she comes out of restraints.  Will need to consider foley placement if
   she continues to soil herself to spite staff.
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department;
   attempting to contact them regarding progress.
   - Needs EKG & electrolytes today after receiving Geodon last night.
   - Will review past psych recommendations and discuss in team meeting
   today.  Some recommendations (med crushing, no silverware) have not
   been routinely followed.  Need to be consistent with patient and will
   post treatment plan for all staff to review before participating in

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, sepsis, and bipolar disorder. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with BIPAP. The patient has a history of persistent bacteremia and is now able to receive long-term antibiotics through a PICC line. She also has a history of pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, and bipolar disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for developing pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
2. Fungal Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to sepsis and prolonged antibiotic use increases the risk of developing a fungal infection.
3. Pain Control: The patient may experience acute or chronic pain, which needs to be effectively managed to prevent further complications.
4. Ineffective Coping: The patient's psychiatric history may lead to ineffective coping mechanisms during her ICU stay.
5. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of PE and requires systemic anticoagulation. Holding IV heparin due to the patient's combativeness poses a risk of self-injury and staff injury.
6. Bacteremia: The patient continues to have bacteremia and needs to complete a 6-week course of vancomycin. Refusal of Linezolid may complicate treatment.
7. Chest Pain: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give her IM Geodon if she becomes agitated and
   aggressive.  Droperidol and Ativan are also options for acute agitation
   if needed.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Geodon 10mg IM for
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   obtained read pending.  On reviewing the medication administration
   record, the patient has only been getting one dose of linezolid per day
   for the last few days (instead of two) because of mediation refusal.
   This pattern is concerning for possible development of antibiotic
   resistance, and this has been explained to the patient.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.
   - PICC line placement yesterday, continue Linezolid for 14 days until
   last negative blood culture (currently [**12-23**] which would make final
   dose on [**1-5**])
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   .
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   - pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  Last night the
   patient refused to wear her BiPAP and it had to be forcibly placed
   while she was in restraints.
   .
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain after
   being placed in restraints last night and continues to complain of the
   same today.  Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real.
   Patient has full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this
   point.
   .
   #Diarrhea: More likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 2.
   - check 3^rd C. diff.
   - Will treat with immodium

   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.
   - continue abx
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.
   - heparin gtt until patient takes meds regularly and INR is
   therapeutic.

   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She left against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1 with her usual complaints, recent fevers, and recent documentation of bacteremia. The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders and has physically harmed medical team members. She continues to refuse necessary medical treatments and is at risk of developing further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, has physically harmed medical team members, and continues to refuse necessary medical treatments. There is a low threshold to use restraints and administer intramuscular (IM) Geodon if she becomes agitated and aggressive.
2. Positive blood cultures: The patient has positive blood cultures showing Staphylococcus simulans and enterococcus, with the enterococcus being resistant to vancomycin. The bacteria are sensitive to linezolid and rifampin. Two blood cultures are sensitive to vancomycin. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations. The nidus of infection is unclear. A chest X-ray showed no infiltrate. Urine culture was negative. Right upper extremity (RUE) ultrasound"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Psychiatric complications: The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, and she has physically harmed medical team members. There will be a low threshold to use restraints and give her IM Geodon if she becomes agitated and aggressive. This suggests a high risk of psychiatric complications such as acute agitation, aggression, and potential self-harm or harm to others.

2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus simulans and Enterococcus, which are both resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to linezolid and rifampin. This indicates a risk of ongoing or recurrent infection, potentially due to antibiotic resistance. The patient's refusal to take medication may further contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein, suggesting a risk of DVT. She is anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin, but her INR is subtherapeutic. This places her at an increased risk of clot formation and potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of asthma and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She requires BiPAP support and needs to wear it at all times while sleeping. Failure to comply with this treatment may result in"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give her IM Geodon if she becomes agitated and
   aggressive.  Droperidol and Ativan are also options for acute agitation
   if needed.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Geodon 10mg IM for
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   - d/w psychiatry how to amend plan to include monitoring
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   obtained read pending.  On reviewing the medication administration
   record, the patient has only been getting one dose of linezolid per day
   for the last few days (instead of two) because of mediation refusal.
   This pattern is concerning for possible development of antibiotic
   resistance, and this has been explained to the patient.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.
   - PICC line placement yesterday, continue Linezolid for 14 days until
   last negative blood culture (currently [**12-23**] which would make final
   dose on [**1-5**]). Have discussed with patient importance of taking
   antibiotics as scheduled, yet patient continues to refuse treatment.
   Continue to offer antibiotics until 14 day course is complete.
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   .
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   -          pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  Whether
   we can force her to do this against her will is unclear at this point
   (is it a medical emergency?) Need to discuss with psychiatry.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain after
   being placed in restraints last night and continues to complain of the
   same today.  Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real.
   Patient has full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this
   point.  Motrin and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: More likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 2.
   - check 3^rd C. diff.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin but PTT now 150
 to reduce heparin drip.
   - continue abx
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.
   - heparin gtt until patient takes meds regularly and INR is
   therapeutic.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR yesterday.
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Based on her poor insight and irrational and reactive
   behavior, patient is not deemed capable of making medical decisions.
   Guardianship in progress.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and left against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1 with her usual chief complaint (CP), recent fevers, and recent documentation of bacteremia. The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders and has physically harmed medical team members. She continues to refuse necessary medical treatments and has shown irrational and reactive behavior. The patient is currently managed with sedating medications and restraints.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Psychiatric issues: The patient's history of axis I and axis II disorders, coupled with her current behavior, suggests potential psychiatric complications. It is important to address these issues promptly to prevent further harm to herself or others.
2. Antibiotic resistance: The patient's refusal of antibiotics may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics to prevent this complication.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and has a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein. This indicates a potential risk for further clot formation and subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE). Close monitoring and anticoagulation therapy are necessary to prevent complications.
4. Sleep apnea: The patient has a history of sleep apnea"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of psychiatric disease, pulmonary embolism (PE), bacteremia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/55 mmHg to 126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula with BiPAP support. The patient's weight is 178 kg, and he is lying on his left side. Physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, right-sided pleuritic chest sounds, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, soft non-tender abdomen, and a PICC insertion site with a small area of ecchymosis. Neurological assessment shows the patient responds appropriately and moves all extremities. 

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels. 

Medical complications that can arise include potential infections due to impaired skin integrity, pain management issues, ineffective coping strategies, and possible respiratory problems due to decreased breath sounds and previous history of OSA. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and history of bacteremia may suggest an ongoing infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give her IM Geodon if she becomes agitated and
   aggressive.  Droperidol and Ativan are also options for acute agitation
   if needed.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Geodon 10mg IM for
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   - d/w psychiatry how to amend plan to include monitoring
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   obtained read pending.  On reviewing the medication administration
   record, the patient has only been getting one dose of linezolid per day
   for the last few days (instead of two) because of mediation refusal.
   This pattern is concerning for possible development of antibiotic
   resistance, and this has been explained to the patient.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.
   - PICC line placement yesterday, continue Linezolid for 14 days until
   last negative blood culture (currently [**12-23**] which would make final
   dose on [**1-5**]). Have discussed with patient importance of taking
   antibiotics as scheduled, yet patient continues to refuse treatment.
   Continue to offer antibiotics until 14 day course is complete.
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   .
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   -          pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  Whether
   we can force her to do this against her will is unclear at this point
   (is it a medical emergency?) Need to discuss with psychiatry.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain after
   being placed in restraints last night and continues to complain of the
   same today.  Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real.
   Patient has full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this
   point.  Motrin and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: More likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 2.
   - check 3^rd C. diff.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin but PTT now 150
 to reduce heparin drip.
   - continue abx
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.
   - heparin gtt until patient takes meds regularly and INR is
   therapeutic.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR yesterday.
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Based on her poor insight and irrational and reactive
   behavior, patient is not deemed capable of making medical decisions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and left against medical advice (AMA) from another hospital. She has been experiencing recent fevers and bacteremia. The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders and has physically harmed medical team members. She continues to refuse necessary medical treatments, including IV access and antibiotics.

Medical Complications:
1. Psychiatric disorder: The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, and she has physically harmed medical team members. She requires psychiatric consultation and assistance with management. There is a low threshold to use restraints and give her IM Geodon if she becomes agitated and aggressive.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures showing Staphylococcus simulans and enterococcus, with the enterococcus being resistant to vancomycin. She has sporadically been getting linezolid, and did not receive any at all yesterday due to medication refusal. This pattern is concerning for possible development of antibiotic resistance and resurgence of bacteremia.
3. Sleep apnea: The patient has a history of somnolence from hypercarbia and subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP. She needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping. Whether we can force"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give her IM Geodon if she becomes agitated and
   aggressive.  Droperidol and Ativan are also options for acute agitation
   if needed.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Geodon 10mg IM for
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   - d/w psychiatry how to amend plan to include monitoring
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for dental abscess.  The patient has only sporadically been
   getting linezolid, and did not receive any at all yesterday (secondary
   to medication refusal).  This pattern is concerning for possible
   development of antibiotic resistance, and resurgence of bacteremia, and
   this has been explained to the patient but she still refuses, even
   after being offered diflucan.
    - Continue Linezolid for 14 days until last negative blood culture
   (currently [**12-23**] which would make final dose on [**1-5**]). Have discussed
   with patient importance of taking antibiotics as scheduled, yet patient
   continues to refuse treatment.  Continue to offer antibiotics until 14
   day course is complete.  If patient continues to take antibiotic
   sporadically, may have to revisit appropriateness of treatment.
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   -          pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  Whether
   we can force her to do this against her will is unclear at this point
   (is it a medical emergency?) Need to discuss with psychiatry.
   -          Patient did not have any difficulties with desaturation off
   oxygen last night, though slept most of the night on her stomach.
   -          Increasing evidence that many of the patient
unresponsive
 spells may be psychogenic and not truly medical
   emergencies.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain after
   being placed in restraints last night and continues to complain of the
   same today.  Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real.
   Patient has full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this
   point.  Motrin and outpatient PT.

   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give her IM Geodon if she becomes agitated and
   aggressive.  Droperidol and Ativan are also options for acute agitation
   if needed.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Geodon 10mg IM for
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   - d/w psychiatry how to amend plan to include monitoring
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for dental abscess.  The patient has only sporadically been
   getting linezolid, and did not receive any at all yesterday (secondary
   to medication refusal).  This pattern is concerning for possible
   development of antibiotic resistance, and resurgence of bacteremia, and
   this has been explained to the patient but she still refuses, even
   after being offered diflucan.
    - Continue Linezolid for 14 days until last negative blood culture
   (currently [**12-23**] which would make final dose on [**1-5**]). Have discussed
   with patient importance of taking antibiotics as scheduled, yet patient
   continues to refuse treatment.  Continue to offer antibiotics until 14
   day course is complete.  If patient continues to take antibiotic
   sporadically, may have to revisit appropriateness of treatment.
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   -          pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  Whether
   we can force her to do this against her will is unclear at this point
   (is it a medical emergency?) Need to discuss with psychiatry.
   -          Patient did not have any difficulties with desaturation off
   oxygen last night, though slept most of the night on her stomach.
   -          Increasing evidence that many of the patient
unresponsive
 spells may be psychogenic and not truly medical
   emergencies.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain after
   being placed in restraints last night and continues to complain of the
   same today.  Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real.
   Patient has full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this
   point.  Motrin and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: More likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 2.
   - check 3^rd C. diff.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin but PTT now 150
 to reduce heparin drip.
   - continue abx
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.
   - heparin gtt until patient takes meds regularly and INR is
   therapeutic.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placed [**12-30**].

   behavior, patient is not deemed capable of making medical decisions.
   Guardianship in progress.  She continues to refuse medical treatments
   and it is becoming increasingly unclear to what extent she is
   benefiting from her current care setting as she is not engaged in her

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and left against medical advice (AMA) from another hospital.
- She has been experiencing recent fevers and documented bacteremia.
- The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders and has physically harmed medical team members. She continues to refuse necessary medical treatments, including IV access and antibiotics.
- Psychiatric consultation is appreciated, and there is a low threshold to use restraints and administer IM Geodon if the patient becomes agitated and aggressive.
- The patient has a positive blood culture showing staph simulans and enterococcus, which are resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to linezolid and rifampin.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Pt refused heparin gtt (was subtherapeutic on coumadin).  But did take
   Coumadin last night.
   At 8:30pm, pt became acutely agitated when instructed to wear bipap.
   She had fallen asleep earlier and desatted to 50s.  She exhibited
   aggressive behavior by pushing equipment (cart) in the room and was
   yelling and swearing.  Due to her aggressive behavior and concerns for
   staff safety, she was put in 4-point restraints.  She remained in
   restraints for a short time before staff felt that it was safe to
   remove them.  Pt apologized for behavior.
   In the morning she refused to have labs drawn (from PICC line), stating
   that she would agree to have them drawn if the security guards would be
   removed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give her IM Geodon if she becomes agitated and
   aggressive.  Droperidol and Ativan are also options for acute agitation
   if needed.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Geodon 10mg IM for
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   - d/w psychiatry how to amend plan to include monitoring
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   obtained read pending.  On reviewing the medication administration
   record, the patient has only been getting one dose of linezolid per day
   for the last few days (instead of two) because of mediation refusal.
   This pattern is concerning for possible development of antibiotic
   resistance, and this has been explained to the patient.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.
   - PICC line placement yesterday, continue Linezolid for 14 days until
   last negative blood culture (currently [**12-23**] which would make final
   dose on [**1-5**]). Have discussed with patient importance of taking
   antibiotics as scheduled, yet patient continues to refuse treatment.
   Continue to offer antibiotics until 14 day course is complete.
   - continue daily surveillance blood cultures as able
   .
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.
   -          pt needs to wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  Whether
   we can force her to do this against her will is unclear at this point
   (is it a medical emergency?) Need to discuss with psychiatry.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain after
   being placed in restraints last night and continues to complain of the
   same today.  Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real.
   Patient has full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this
   point.  Motrin and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: More likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 2.
   - check 3^rd C. diff.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin but PTT now 150
 to reduce heparin drip.
   - continue abx
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.
   - heparin gtt until patient takes meds regularly and INR is
   therapeutic.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR yesterday.
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Based on her poor insight and irrational and reactive
   behavior, patient is not deemed capable of making medical decisions.

   Patient refused labs this morning.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is refusing abilify.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   - d/w psychiatry how to amend plan to include monitoring
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient continues to refuse linezolid and has
   not received any of this medication for a few days.
   - Continue Linezolid for 14 days until last negative blood culture
   (currently [**12-23**] which would make final dose on [**1-5**]).  However,
   unclear what proper course is now that patient has refused so many
   doses.  Have discussed with patient importance of taking antibiotics as
   scheduled, yet patient continues to refuse treatment.  Continue to
   offer antibiotics until 14 day course is complete.
   - continue surveillance blood cultures as able
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  However, it
   appears that at least some of these episodes are psychogenic and not
   true medical emergencies.
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  She continues to
   refuse this treatment.  Whether we can force her to do this against her
   will is unclear at this point (is it a medical emergency?) Need to
   discuss with psychiatry.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 3.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin
   - continue to recommend abx
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.  Patient has been refusing blood draws for the
   last couple of days.  We were able to obtain blood once yesterday.
   - PTT level has been therapeutic the last couple of draws, continue
   heparin gtt.
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  She is likely therapeutic
   currently, but blood unobtainable due to patient refusal.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**]).  Patient was offered PO diflucan per her request, but
   she is not getting it as she is not taking linezolid.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and coagulase-negative staphylococci. She has difficulty with agitation and noncompliance. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/42 mmHg to 123/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving lorazepam (Ativan) and haloperidol (Haldol) as needed for agitation. She has been on Coumadin for prior PE and DVTs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern at the moment is respiratory failure. This can be a life-threatening condition if not properly managed.

2. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia with VRE and coagulase-negative staphylococci. There is a risk of developing further infections while in the ICU.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's history of DVT and PE indicates a higher risk for blood clots. While she is on Coumadin, which is used for anticoagulation, there is still a possibility of developing new clots in the ICU.

4. Agitation and Noncompliance: The patient's difficulty with agitation and noncompliance may pose challenges in providing appropriate care and treatment.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient is listed with impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or infections if not properly managed.

6. Fungal Infection: The patient has a history of fungal infection, which can potentially worsen during her ICU stay.

7. Pain Control: The patient requires pain control both for acute and chronic pain, which needs to be addressed to ensure her comfort and overall well-being.

8. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has a history of OSA, which may be exacerbated by her current condition and could impact her respiratory status.

These potential medical complications highlight areas that require close monitoring and appropriate management to ensure the patient's well-being during her ICU stay."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and coag-negative staph, and difficulty with agitation and noncompliance. The patient has allergies to penicillins, Haldol (Haloperidol), Compazine (Prochlorperazine Maleate), Desipramine, Chlorpromazine, Imipramine, Zoloft (Sertraline Hcl), and shellfish. The patient has been receiving various medications including lorazepam (Ativan) and haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation, as well as Coumadin for prior PE and DVTs.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), a current temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), a heart rate of 81 bpm with a range of 80-130 bpm, a blood pressure ranging from 72/42 mmHg to 123/86 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute with a range of 0-35 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 178 kg and height is 68 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,943 mL and output of 1,850 mL.

The patient's recent events include difficulty with agitation and noncompliance. The patient has a history of psychiatric disease, impaired skin integrity, pain control, prior pulmonary embolism, bacteremia, chest pain, obstructive sleep apnea, and DVT. The patient is currently on Coumadin for prior PE and DVTs, and is being treated with Haldol and Ativan for agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial chief complaint was respiratory failure, which could be a result of obesity hypoventilation syndrome and previous asthma. There is also a history of bacteremia, which could potentially lead to pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, which increases the risk of developing another DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE) while in the ICU.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of PE, there is a risk of developing another PE due to immobility and potential clot formation.
4. Bacteremia: The patient previously had bacteremia with VRE and coag-negative staph. There is a risk of developing sepsis or secondary infections.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.
6. Agitation and noncompliance: The patient's agitation and noncompliance with treatment may complicate management and increase the risk of adverse events.
7. Psychiatric disease: The patient has a history of psychiatric disease, which may require additional management and could potentially complicate the clinical course."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is refusing abilify.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient continues to refuse linezolid and has
   not received any of this medication for a few days but did take it
   today.
   - Continue Linezolid for 14 days from last positive blood culture, D1=
   [**2156-12-23**], day 14 = [**2157-1-6**].  Although patient has been intermittently
   taking Linezolid, we will stop treatment on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood
   cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  However, it
   appears that at least some of these episodes are psychogenic and not
   true medical emergencies.
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  She intermittently
   refuses but since this is a medical necessity we are attempting to
   enforce this.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 3.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.  Patient has been refusing blood draws for the
   last couple of days.  We were able to obtain blood once yesterday.
   - PTT level has been therapeutic the last couple of draws, continue
   heparin gtt.
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is 1.8 today, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and heparin gtt until therapeutic.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**]).  Fluconazole X 3 days (last day today)
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.  Discussed with legal today
   ([**1-4**]), and process is currently underway, no court date as of yet.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is refusing abilify.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   - d/w psychiatry how to amend plan to include monitoring
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient continues to refuse linezolid and has
   not received any of this medication for a few days.
   - Continue Linezolid for 14 days until last negative blood culture
   (currently [**12-23**] which would make final dose on [**1-5**]).  However,
   unclear what proper course is now that patient has refused so many
   doses.  Have discussed with patient importance of taking antibiotics as
   scheduled, yet patient continues to refuse treatment.  Continue to
   offer antibiotics until 14 day course is complete.
   - continue surveillance blood cultures as able
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  However, it
   appears that at least some of these episodes are psychogenic and not
   true medical emergencies.
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  She continues to
   refuse this treatment.  Whether we can force her to do this against her
   will is unclear at this point (is it a medical emergency?) Need to
   discuss with psychiatry.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 3.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin
   - continue to recommend abx
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.  Patient has been refusing blood draws for the
   last couple of days.  We were able to obtain blood once yesterday.
   - PTT level has been therapeutic the last couple of draws, continue
   heparin gtt.
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  She is likely therapeutic
   currently, but blood unobtainable due to patient refusal.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: baseline mid to upper 20s.
   - to follow serial Hct
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**]).  Patient was offered PO diflucan per her request, but
   she is not getting it as she is not taking linezolid.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, DVT/PE, recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice from another hospital. She presents with fevers and bacteremia, continues to refuse medical treatments, and has a history of axis I and axis II disorders. The patient's current condition includes refusal of medical treatments, recent fevers, and documented bacteremia. She also has a positive blood culture for Staph simulans and Enterococcus, which are sensitive to linezolid and rifampin, but she has not received any doses of linezolid for a few days. Other medical issues include sleep apnea, left shoulder pain, diarrhea, superficial thrombus in the left upper extremity, COPD/asthma, anemia, finger subluxation, and vaginal yeast infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Psychiatric complications: The patient's history of axis I and axis II disorders, refusal of medical treatments, and physical harm towards medical team members indicate potential psychiatric complications that may require psychiatric consultation and assistance with management.
2. Infection: The patient has documented bacteremia with positive blood cultures for Staph simulans and Enterococcus. Despite being sensitive to linezolid and rifampin, the patient has not received any doses of linezolid for a few days. This increases the risk of ongoing infection and potential antibiotic resistance.

The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show some fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's oxygen saturation is 86%, indicating possible hypoxemia. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's medical conditions include psychiatric disease, impaired skin integrity, fungal infection, pain control, ineffective coping, PE, bacteremia, chest pain, and OSA. The patient is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 86%, which is below the normal range. This indicates a potential risk of hypoxemia and may require interventions such as supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old with borderline personality disorder and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has not been taking their prescribed medication, including coumadin. They have multiple known allergies and are currently on several medications such as linezolid, lorazepam, prilosec, droperidol, atrovent, and fluconazole.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated body temperature, normal heart rate, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation at 86%. The patient is unable to stand due to musculoskeletal issues and their neurological examination is incomplete.

The laboratory results indicate abnormal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, creatinine, blood glucose, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes psychiatric disease, impaired skin integrity, fungal infection, pain control, ineffective coping, pulmonary embolism, bacteremia, chest pain, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

The assessment and plan include continuing the use of coumadin and linezolid, discussing the patient's destructive behavior and potential transfer to another facility for discharge, and addressing various aspects of ICU care such as nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is refusing abilify.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient continues to refuse linezolid and has
   not received any of this medication for a few days but did take it
   today.
   - Continue Linezolid for 14 days from last positive blood culture, D1=
   [**2156-12-23**], day 14 = [**2157-1-6**].  Although patient has been intermittently
   taking Linezolid, we will stop treatment on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood
   cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  However, it
   appears that at least some of these episodes are psychogenic and not
   true medical emergencies.
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  She intermittently
   refuses but since this is a medical necessity we are attempting to
   enforce this.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 3.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.  Patient has been refusing blood draws for the
   last couple of days.  We were able to obtain blood once yesterday.
   - PTT level has been therapeutic the last couple of draws, continue
   heparin gtt.
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is 1.8 today, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and heparin gtt until therapeutic.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**]).  Fluconazole X 3 days (last day today)
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.  Discussed with legal today
   ([**1-4**]), and process is currently underway, no court date as of yet.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is refusing abilify.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient did take linezolid yesterday.
   - Continue Linezolid for 14 days from last positive blood culture, D1=
   [**2156-12-23**], day 14 = [**2157-1-6**].  Although patient has been intermittently
   taking Linezolid, we will stop treatment on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood
   cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  However, it
   appears that at least some of these episodes are psychogenic and not
   true medical emergencies.
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  She intermittently
   refuses but since this is a medical necessity we are strongly
   encouraging this, and must be enforced when taking sedating
   medications.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 3.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.  Patient has been refusing blood draws for the
   last couple of days.  We were able to obtain blood once yesterday.
   - PTT level has been therapeutic the last couple of draws, continue
   heparin gtt.
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is 1.8 today, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and heparin gtt until therapeutic.
   Patient took coumadin yesterday, but refused the day before, likely why
   her level is low.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1. She has been admitted to the ICU again for fevers, recent documentation of bacteremia, and continues to refuse medical treatments.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions:

1. Psychiatric: The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, which is causing agitation and refusal of necessary medical treatments. Psychiatric consultation is appreciated, and the use of restraints and sedating medications like droperidol and ativan may be necessary for acute agitation.

2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures showing staph simulans and enterococcus. The enterococcus is resistant to vancomycin. The bacteria are sensitive to linezolid and rifampin. Two blood cultures are sensitive to vancomycin. Although the patient has been intermittently taking linezolid, it will be continued for 14 days from the last positive blood culture, and then stopped on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.

3. Sleep apnea: The patient has a history of somnolence from hypercarbia and subsequent intubation when she does"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is refusing abilify.
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient did take linezolid yesterday.
   - Continue Linezolid for 14 days from last positive blood culture, D1=
   [**2156-12-23**], day 14 = [**2157-1-6**].  Although patient has been intermittently
   taking Linezolid, we will stop treatment on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood
   cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  However, it
   appears that at least some of these episodes are psychogenic and not
   true medical emergencies.
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  She intermittently
   refuses but since this is a medical necessity we are strongly
   encouraging this, and must be enforced when taking sedating
   medications.
   #4 Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this is an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  C. diff negative x 3.
   - Will treat with immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin
   # hx PE: Subtherapeutic.  Patient has been refusing blood draws for the
   last couple of days.  We were able to obtain blood once yesterday.
   - PTT level has been therapeutic the last couple of draws, continue
   heparin gtt.
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is 1.8 today, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and heparin gtt until therapeutic.
   Patient took coumadin yesterday, but refused the day before, likely why
   her level is low.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Plastics consulted.  Per plastics, the finger is
   not truly dislocated.  They recommend a special splint for her swan
   neck deformity, however, the patient has refused this splint.  They do
   not feel that a hard cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   # Code Status: Full
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice (AMA) from another hospital. She has been admitted to the ICU again due to fevers, recent documentation of bacteremia, and continues to refuse medical treatments.

The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, and there is a need for a psych consultation and assistance with management. The patient has physically harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical treatments, including IV access and antibiotics. There will be a low threshold to use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if needed.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature - 37.7°C, blood pressure - 123/58 mmHg, heart rate - 106 bpm, respiratory rate - 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation - 87%. The patient is currently not on any respiratory support.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including a positive blood culture with Staphylococcus simulans and enterococcus, which is resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to linezolid and rifampin. There is also a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein, possibly serving as a nidus of infection. The patient has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient intermittently refuses abilify.  There was a
   conversation w/Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3972**] yesterday regarding d/cing the 24-7
   security guard outside her room. [**Known firstname 3971**] was told after the discussion
   that we could stop the security guard but afterwards nursing expressed
   concerns about safety and the security guard remained in place which
   agitated [**Known firstname 3971**] and resulted in us calling security.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient did take linezolid yesterday.
   - Last day of Linezolid is today for a total of a 2 week course of
   treatment for bacteremia.  Although patient has been intermittently
   taking Linezolid, we will stop treatment on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood
   cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  Patient refuses
   to use BiPAP machines most nights, although when we are able to monitor
   her O2 sat it is usually <88 when she is sleeping and on either NC or
   on RA.  It appears that at least some of these unresponsive episodes
   are psychogenic and not true medical emergencies.
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  She intermittently
   refuses but since this is a medical necessity we are strongly
   encouraging this, and must be enforced when taking sedating
   medications.
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode is today.  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated.  They
   recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity, however, the
   patient has refused this splint in the past b/c she states it does not
   work and is refusing it again today.  They do not feel that a hard cast
   is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  Has improved.  C. diff
   negative x 3.
   - Will treat with Immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]): Subtherapeutic.  Patient intermittently refuses
   coumadin
   - PTT level has been therapeutic the last couple of draws, continue
   heparin gtt.
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is 1.8 today, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and heparin gtt until therapeutic.
   Patient took coumadin yesterday, but refused the day before, likely why
   her level is low.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this was an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT. Seems to have resolved as patient is no longer
   complaining.
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.  Screened by BEST yesterday.
   Medically clear for psych hospital.

","The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice from Hospital1. She has been admitted to the ICU again due to her recent fevers and documented bacteremia. The patient continues to refuse medical treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood draws, and Coumadin doses.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:
1. Psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders. There is a need for a psych consult and assistance with management. The patient has physically harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical treatments. There is a low threshold to use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if needed.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has been documented with bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus simulans and Enterococcus species. The enterococcus is resistant to vancomycin. The two bacteria together are only sensitive to linezolid and rifampin. Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin. Although the patient took linezolid yesterday, the last day of treatment will be today as further blood cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
3. Sleep apnea: The patient has a history of somnolence from hypercarbia and subsequent intubation"

   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient intermittently refuses abilify.  There was a
   conversation w/Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3972**] yesterday regarding d/cing the 24-7
   security guard outside her room. [**Known firstname 3971**] was told after the discussion
   that we could stop the security guard but afterwards nursing expressed
   concerns about safety and the security guard remained in place which
   agitated [**Known firstname 3971**] and resulted in us calling security.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient did take linezolid yesterday.
   - Last day of Linezolid is today for a total of a 2 week course of
   treatment for bacteremia.  Although patient has been intermittently
   taking Linezolid, we will stop treatment on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood
   cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  Patient refuses
   to use BiPAP machines most nights, although when we are able to monitor
   her O2 sat it is usually <88 when she is sleeping and on either NC or
   on RA.  It appears that at least some of these unresponsive episodes
   are psychogenic and not true medical emergencies.
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  She intermittently
   refuses but since this is a medical necessity we are strongly
   encouraging this, and must be enforced when taking sedating
   medications.
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode is today.  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated.  They
   recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity, however, the
   patient has refused this splint in the past b/c she states it does not
   work and is refusing it again today.  They do not feel that a hard cast
   is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  Has improved.  C. diff
   negative x 3.
   - Will treat with Immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]): Subtherapeutic.  Patient intermittently refuses
   coumadin
   - PTT level has been therapeutic the last couple of draws, continue
   heparin gtt.
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is 1.8 today, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and heparin gtt until therapeutic.
   Patient took coumadin yesterday, but refused the day before, likely why
   her level is low.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this was an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT. Seems to have resolved as patient is no longer
   complaining.
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.  Screened by BEST yesterday.
   Medically clear for psych hospital.

","The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was discharged against medical advice from Hospital1 with her usual chief complaint of abdominal pain, recent fevers, and recent documentation of bacteremia. The patient continues to refuse medical treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood draws, and coumadin doses.

She has multiple medical complications, including positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus simulans and enterococcus, which are resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to linezolid and rifampin. Her echocardiogram showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations, and the source of infection is unclear. She has a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein, which may be a nidus for infection, but no deep vein thrombosis in the left upper extremity. Dental panorex negative for abscess.

The patient also has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, and a psych consult is appreciated. She has physically harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical treatments, including IV access, antibiotics, and coumadin doses. There will be a low threshold to use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if needed. The patient intermittently refuses Abilify.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels
   she needs them.  Patient intermittently refuses abilify.  Per
   discussion in the team meeting this afternoon, 24-hour security guard
   will be discontinued as she has demonstrated better behavioral control
   over the last several days.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely
   agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient did take linezolid yesterday.
   - Last day of Linezolid  [**1-6**] for a total of a 2 week course of
   treatment for bacteremia.  Although patient has been intermittently
   taking Linezolid, treatment stopped on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood
   cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  This was likely
   the case on her first intubation during her prior admission, however,
   subsequent intubations were with blood gases that were within the range
   of normal for her.  The patient has refused to use BiPAP and
   supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the past week and when she
   wears the monitor (which she also refuses at times) O2 sat is usually
   >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  From a medical standpoint, the
   patient would benefit from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly
   demonstrated that she is in no imminent danger when not wearing it.
   The change in her psychiatric medications with less sedating
   medications have likely helped in this regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be psychogenic and not true medical
   emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications.
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode [**1-6**].  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated.  They
   recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity, however, the
   patient has refused this splint.  Plastics does not feel that a hard
   cast is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  Has improved.  C. diff
   negative x 3.  Stool O&P negative x 2.  Now just
loose stool
   - Treating with Immodium
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Likely secondary to above.  LFTs, amylase, lipase all
   normal yesterday.  Stable.  No need for further evaluation at this
   time.
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]):
   -          coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is 2.0  today,
   will continue to give Coumadin at 3mg
   -          stop heparin gtt today.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this was an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT. Seems to have resolved as patient is no longer
   complaining.
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.  Team meeting today.  Search
   for psychiatric placement is in process.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient intermittently refuses abilify.  There was a
   conversation w/Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3972**] yesterday regarding d/cing the 24-7
   security guard outside her room. [**Known firstname 3971**] was told after the discussion
   that we could stop the security guard but afterwards nursing expressed
   concerns about safety and the security guard remained in place which
   agitated [**Known firstname 3971**] and resulted in us calling security.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV or ativan 1-2 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation 24/7
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient did take linezolid yesterday.
   - Last day of Linezolid is today for a total of a 2 week course of
   treatment for bacteremia.  Although patient has been intermittently
   taking Linezolid, we will stop treatment on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood
   cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  Patient refuses
   to use BiPAP machines most nights, although when we are able to monitor
   her O2 sat it is usually <88 when she is sleeping and on either NC or
   on RA.  It appears that at least some of these unresponsive episodes
   are psychogenic and not true medical emergencies.
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP at all times while sleeping.  She intermittently
   refuses but since this is a medical necessity we are strongly
   encouraging this, and must be enforced when taking sedating
   medications.
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode is today.  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated.  They
   recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity, however, the
   patient has refused this splint in the past b/c she states it does not
   work and is refusing it again today.  They do not feel that a hard cast
   is indicated.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  Has improved.  C. diff
   negative x 3.
   - Will treat with Immodium
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point.,
   bridging w/heparin
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]): Subtherapeutic.  Patient intermittently refuses
   coumadin
   - PTT level has been therapeutic the last couple of draws, continue
   heparin gtt.
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is 1.8 today, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and heparin gtt until therapeutic.
   Patient took coumadin yesterday, but refused the day before, likely why
   her level is low.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this was an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT. Seems to have resolved as patient is no longer
   complaining.
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.  Screened by BEST yesterday.
   Medically clear for psych hospital.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She left against medical advice from another hospital with her usual chief complaint, recent fevers, and documented bacteremia. The patient continues to refuse medical treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood draws, and coumadin doses. She has a history of axis I and axis II disorders and has physically harmed medical team members. There is a low threshold to use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Psychiatric disorder: The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders and has shown aggressive behavior towards the medical team. This poses a risk for further psychiatric episodes and potential harm to herself or others.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has documented bacteremia with Staphylococcus simulans and enterococcus, which is resistant to vancomycin. Although she has been intermittently taking Linezolid, further surveillance is needed to ensure the infection does not recur.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein, which could potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism if not properly managed with anticoagulation.
4. Sleep apnea: The patient has a history of som"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been refusing medical treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood draws, and Coumadin doses.

The patient has a positive blood culture for Staphylococcus simulans and Enterococcus, which are resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to linezolid and rifampin. However, two blood cultures are sensitive to vancomycin. The patient has completed a two-week course of treatment for bacteremia with linezolid.

The patient also has a history of sleep apnea and refuses to use BiPAP machines most nights. It is mentioned that some of her unresponsive episodes are psychogenic and not true medical emergencies.

Additionally, the patient has experienced finger subluxation and has refused splinting recommendations from plastics. She has been given pain medication as needed.

The patient also has diarrhea, which is likely due to antibiotic side effects, and has improved. C. diff has been negative three times.

The patient has a superficial thrombus in the left upper extremity, which may be a nidus for infection. She is anticoagulated with Coumadin, although subtherapeutic at this point, and is bridging with heparin.

The patient's COPD/asthma requires nebs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old woman with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and a severe personality disorder. She has a history of allergies to several medications and shellfish. The patient was admitted to the ICU, where she received various treatments and interventions.

24-hour events include the re-subluxation of a finger, which was repositioned. The patient's vital signs have been monitored, showing stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation within normal ranges. Her weight remains unchanged at 178 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,637 mL and output of 1,500 mL.

The patient is on several medications, including Heparin Sodium, Prilosec, Flovent, Coumadin, Atrovent, and Ropinirole. She also has an infusion of Linezolid. Review of systems and physical examination findings are mostly unchanged from admission, except for the re-subluxed finger and the fact that certain areas were not assessed.

Laboratory results show fluctuations in white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Other lab values, such as creatinine, total carbon dioxide, electrolytes, and liver enzymes, are also provided.

Assessment and plan include discontinuing heparin due to therapeutic INR levels for DVT/PE prophylaxis. A team meeting will be held to discuss disposition and a security issue. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels
   she needs them.  Per discussion in the team meeting on [**1-7**]-hour
   security guard was discontinued as she has demonstrated better
   behavioral control over the last several days.  Security was called
   briefly last night due to patient agitation and walk-throughs were
   performed.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely
   agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: Patient finished course of treatment with
   linezolid (though intermittently compliant) on [**1-6**] and blood cultures
   show no growth.  Documentation from Shattock showed staph simulans and
   enterococcus.  The enterococcus was resistant to vanc.  The two
   bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and rifampin.
   Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE Echo showed
   no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of infection was
   unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S
   showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible nidus of
   infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex negative for
   abscess.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  This was likely
   the case on her first intubation during her prior admission, however,
   subsequent intubations were with blood gases that were within the range
   of normal for her.  The patient has refused to use BiPAP and
   supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the past week and when she
   wears the monitor (which she also refuses at times) O2 sat is usually
   >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  She does occasionally desat to
   the 70s or 60s ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4004**] [**Location (un) **] is sometimes poor), but recovers
   spontaneously.  From a medical standpoint, the patient would benefit
   from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly demonstrated that she is in no
   imminent danger when not wearing it and she consistently refuses to
   wear it.  The change in her psychiatric medications with less sedating
   medications have likely helped in this regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be psychogenic and not true medical
   emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice from Hospital1. She has been in the ICU for the past week due to fevers, bacteremia, and refusal of medical treatments including monitoring, antibiotics, blood draws, and coumadin doses.

The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psychiatric consultation and assistance with management are appreciated. The patient has physically harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical treatments (IV access, antibiotics). There will be a low threshold to use restraints and give droperidol and ativan for acute agitation if needed. The patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels she needs them. Security was briefly called last night due to patient agitation and walk-throughs were performed.

Plan to deal with the patient's acute agitation:
- Give her a 20-minute cool-off period for initial agitation (do not try to reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20 minutes to discuss care
- Encourage distraction techniques (TV, music)
- Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25 mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
- MUST wear bipap if any sedating medications given"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels
   she needs them.  Patient intermittently refuses abilify.  Per
   discussion in the team meeting this afternoon, 24-hour security guard
   will be discontinued as she has demonstrated better behavioral control
   over the last several days.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely
   agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: documentation from Shattock shows staph
   simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus is resistant to vanc.  The
   two bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and
   rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE
   Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of
   infection is unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.
   RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible
   nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex
   negative for abscess.  Patient did take linezolid yesterday.
   - Last day of Linezolid  [**1-6**] for a total of a 2 week course of
   treatment for bacteremia.  Although patient has been intermittently
   taking Linezolid, treatment stopped on [**2157-1-6**] as further blood
   cultures have been negative and she has been afebrile.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  This was likely
   the case on her first intubation during her prior admission, however,
   subsequent intubations were with blood gases that were within the range
   of normal for her.  The patient has refused to use BiPAP and
   supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the past week and when she
   wears the monitor (which she also refuses at times) O2 sat is usually
   >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  From a medical standpoint, the
   patient would benefit from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly
   demonstrated that she is in no imminent danger when not wearing it.
   The change in her psychiatric medications with less sedating
   medications have likely helped in this regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be psychogenic and not true medical
   emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old female with recent history of endocarditis and chronic ventilatory failure requiring BIPAP support. The patient has continued behaviors interfering with medical care, such as refusal of coumadin dosing. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic ventilatory failure and is on BIPAP support. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the BIPAP is not functioning properly or if the patient's condition worsens.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE): The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is currently on Coumadin for anticoagulation. There is a risk of developing another DVT/PE if the anticoagulation is not effective or if the patient's mobility is restricted.

3. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of endocarditis, and it is being treated with Linezolid. There is a risk of treatment failure or recurrent infection if the antibiotics are not effective or if the patient develops resistance to the medication.

4. Psychiatric Disease: The patient has psychiatric behaviors that are interfering with medical care. This can pose a challenge in managing the patient's overall condition and may require additional interventions to ensure cooperation and adherence to the treatment plan.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels
   she needs them but must comply w/EKG prior to Droperidol and O2
   monitor/Bipap prior to Ativan.  Per discussion in the team meeting on
   [**1-7**]-hour security guard was discontinued as she has demonstrated
   better behavioral control over the last several days.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely
   agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation as needed
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   .
   # sleep apnea: Has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  This was likely
   the case on her first intubation during her prior admission, however,
   subsequent intubations were with blood gases that were within the range
   of normal for her.  The patient has refused to use BiPAP and
   supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the past week and when she
   wears the monitor (which she also refuses at times) O2 sat is usually
   >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  She does occasionally desat to
   the 70s or 60s ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4004**] [**Location (un) **] is sometimes poor), but recovers
   spontaneously.  From a medical standpoint, the patient would benefit
   from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly demonstrated that she is in no
   imminent danger when not wearing it and she consistently refuses to
   wear it.  The change in her psychiatric medications with less sedating
   medications have likely helped in this regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be psychogenic and not true medical
   emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications.
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode [**1-8**].  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated.  They
   recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity, however, the
   patient has refused this splint.  Plastics does not feel that a hard
   cast is indicated.  Reduction can be performed at bedside by medical
   team. Last night PT reduced finger and provided a hard splint.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   .
   # Hx of positive blood cultures: Now w/2 weeks of negative BCx and
   patient just finished course of treatment with linezolid (though
   intermittently compliant) on [**1-6**].  Patient has been afebrile
   throughout her entire treatment course.  Documentation from Shattock
   showed staph simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus was resistant
   to vanc.  The two bacteria together are only both sensitive to
   linezolid and rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to
   vancomycin.   TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular
   vegetations.   Nidus of infection was unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.
   Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in
   cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no
   DVT.  Dental panorex negative for abscess.
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]):
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is therapeutic, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and monitor.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   Other complaints [**Known firstname 3971**] has had intermittently during her hospital stay:
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  Has improved.  C. diff
   negative x 3.  Stool O&P negative x 2.  Now just
loose stool
   - Treating with Immodium
   - Bowel regimen only prn.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Likely secondary to above.  LFTs, amylase, lipase all
   normal. UA normal.  Stable.  No need for further evaluation at this
   time.
   .
   #
Chilliness
: Patient complains of being cold in her room x 5 days
   despite the heat being turned up.  TSH was 2.2 on [**2156-12-9**].
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this was an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT. Seems to have resolved as patient is no longer
   complaining.
   .
   #Pruritis: could be due to increase frequency of bathing leading to dry
   skin. No rashes noted. No new meds to explain pruritis.
   -Sarna TID
   -Attarax x1 dose
   -Avoiding benadryl b/c of potential sedating effects. Would say patient
   should be monitored by O2 sat monitor if she gets benadryl.
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.  Search for psychiatric
   placement is in process.

","The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, DVT/PE, and recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been leaving against medical advice and has refused medical treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood draws, and coumadin doses. The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, and there have been instances where she physically harmed medical team members. She continues to refuse necessary medical treatments, but has demonstrated better behavioral control in recent days. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 127/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her current weight is 178 kg, and her height is 68 inches. 

Her physical examination reveals distant heart sounds with regular rate and rhythm, clear lung fields bilaterally, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and warm, dry skin with no rashes noted. Neurological examination shows that she moves all extremities. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 311 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, sodium of 104 mg/dL, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, chloride of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 26.3, blood urea nitrogen of 7.1 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose of 138 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated PT/PTT/INR levels, low calcium and magnesium levels, and normal phosphate levels. Blood cultures have been negative, except for initial positive results for coag-negative staphylococci. 

The patient's assessment includes the following plans:
1. Psychiatric: Consultation and assistance with management are appreciated due to the patient's history of axis I and axis II disorders. Restraints may be used if necessary, and Droperidol and Ativan can be administered for acute agitation after obtaining EKG and O2 monitor/Bipap. 
2. Sleep apnea: The patient should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications, and O2 saturation should be monitored. 
3. Finger subluxation: The patient's ring finger keeps subluxing, and she has refused a special splint recommended by plastics. Tylenol/ibuprofen can be given for pain, but not Percocet due to sedating side effects. 
4. Hx of positive blood cultures: The patient has completed a course of linezolid for enterococcus and staph simulans infections. However, two recent blood cultures have been negative, and the patient has been afebrile throughout treatment. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of infection. 
5. Hx PE: The patient has a history of D"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels
   she needs them.  Per discussion in the team meeting on [**1-7**]-hour
   security guard was discontinued as she has demonstrated better
   behavioral control over the last several days.  Security was called
   briefly last night due to patient agitation and walk-throughs were
   performed.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely
   agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: Patient finished course of treatment with
   linezolid (though intermittently compliant) on [**1-6**] and blood cultures
   show no growth.  Documentation from Shattock showed staph simulans and
   enterococcus.  The enterococcus was resistant to vanc.  The two
   bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and rifampin.
   Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE Echo showed
   no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of infection was
   unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S
   showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible nidus of
   infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex negative for
   abscess.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  This was likely
   the case on her first intubation during her prior admission, however,
   subsequent intubations were with blood gases that were within the range
   of normal for her.  The patient has refused to use BiPAP and
   supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the past week and when she
   wears the monitor (which she also refuses at times) O2 sat is usually
   >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  She does occasionally desat to
   the 70s or 60s ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4004**] [**Location (un) **] is sometimes poor), but recovers
   spontaneously.  From a medical standpoint, the patient would benefit
   from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly demonstrated that she is in no
   imminent danger when not wearing it and she consistently refuses to
   wear it.  The change in her psychiatric medications with less sedating
   medications have likely helped in this regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be psychogenic and not true medical
   emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications.
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode [**1-6**].  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated.  They
   recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity, however, the
   patient has refused this splint.  Plastics does not feel that a hard
   cast is indicated.  Reduction can be performed at bedside by medical
   team.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  Has improved.  C. diff
   negative x 3.  Stool O&P negative x 2.  Now just
loose stool
   - Treating with Immodium
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Likely secondary to above.  LFTs, amylase, lipase all
   normal yesterday.  Stable.  No need for further evaluation at this
   time.
   .
   #
Chilliness
: Patient complains of being cold in her room x 5 days
   despite the heat being turned up.  TSH was 2.2 on [**2156-12-9**].
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]):
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is therapeutic, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and monitor.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this was an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT. Seems to have resolved as patient is no longer
   complaining.
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.  Search for psychiatric
   placement is in process.

   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   #2 Positive blood cultures: Patient finished course of treatment with
   linezolid (though intermittently compliant) on [**1-6**] and blood cultures
   show no growth.  Documentation from Shattock showed staph simulans and
   enterococcus.  The enterococcus was resistant to vanc.  The two
   bacteria together are only both sensitive to linezolid and rifampin.
   Two blood cultures here are sensitive to vancomycin.   TEE Echo showed
   no endocarditis or valvular vegetations.   Nidus of infection was
   unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.  Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S
   showing partially occluded thrombus in cephalic vein, possible nidus of
   infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no DVT.  Dental panorex negative for
   abscess.
   - will only draw surveillance cultures if febrile or otherwise
   medically declining
   .
   #3 sleep apnea: has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  This was likely
   the case on her first intubation during her prior admission, however,
   subsequent intubations were with blood gases that were within the range
   of normal for her.  The patient has refused to use BiPAP and
   supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the past week and when she
   wears the monitor (which she also refuses at times) O2 sat is usually
   >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  She does occasionally desat to
   the 70s or 60s ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4004**] [**Location (un) **] is sometimes poor), but recovers
   spontaneously.  From a medical standpoint, the patient would benefit
   from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly demonstrated that she is in no
   imminent danger when not wearing it and she consistently refuses to
   wear it.  The change in her psychiatric medications with less sedating
   medications have likely helped in this regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be psychogenic and not true medical
   emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications.
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode [**1-6**].  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated.  They
   recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity, however, the
   patient has refused this splint.  Plastics does not feel that a hard
   cast is indicated.  Reduction can be performed at bedside by medical
   team.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  Has improved.  C. diff
   negative x 3.  Stool O&P negative x 2.  Now just
loose stool
   - Treating with Immodium
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Likely secondary to above.  LFTs, amylase, lipase all
   normal yesterday.  Stable.  No need for further evaluation at this
   time.
   .
   #
Chilliness
: Patient complains of being cold in her room x 5 days
   despite the heat being turned up.  TSH was 2.2 on [**2156-12-9**].
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]):
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is therapeutic, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and monitor.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this was an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT. Seems to have resolved as patient is no longer
   complaining.
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1. The patient has been experiencing fevers and documentation of bacteremia. She continues to refuse medical treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood draws, and coumadin doses.

The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, and a psych consult and assistance with management are appreciated. The patient has physically harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical treatments. There will be a low threshold to use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if needed. The patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels she needs them.

Plan to deal with the patient's acute agitation:
- Give her a 20-minute cool-off for initial agitation.
- Encourage distraction techniques (TV, music).
- Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely agitated) or ativan 0.5-1 mg IV.
- Must wear bipap if any sedating medications given.
- Hospital security observation.
- Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan.
- Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this point, we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in an emergency"

   Assessment and Plan
   28 yo female with significant behavoiral issues now with prolonged ICU
   stay with intermittent need for ventilatory support with BIPAP and long
   term anti-coagulation with Coumadin for known DVT/PE and endocarditis
   now treated with very reassuring TEE showing absence of vegitation.
   Her medical management has been maintenance of chronic levels of
   support for non-invasive ventilatory support.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Chronic and related to obestity and sleep related
   hypoventilation
   -BIPAP with any period of sleep
   2)DVT/PE-
   -Continue Coumadin
   3)Endocarditis-
   -Completed course of Linezolid for known pathogens
   4)Beharioral Disorder-
   -Appreciate psychiatry input and guidance in management
   -Major issue is pursuit of long term appropriate faility to allow
   optimal treatment of psychitatric disease in the setting of chronic
   medical disease which has been stably responsive to treatment
   Additional issues to be managed as described in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of behavioral issues, respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and endocarditis. She has been in the ICU for a prolonged period and requires intermittent ventilatory support with BIPAP. She is on long-term anticoagulation with Coumadin.

The patient's medical management includes chronic levels of support for non-invasive ventilatory support, continuing Coumadin for DVT/PE, completing a course of Linezolid for endocarditis, and seeking psychiatric input for her behavioral disorder.

Potential medical complications that can arise include impaired skin integrity, fungal infection, pain control, ineffective coping, psychiatric disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and chest pain.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/56 to 133/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26-28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and weight of 178 kg.

Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 4.9 to 8.1 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level ranging from 27.0% to 28.9%, platelet count ranging from 33 to 11 thousand/mm³, creatinine level ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 mg/dL, glucose"

   28 yo female with significant behavoiral issues now with prolonged ICU
   stay with intermittent need for ventilatory support with BIPAP and long
   term anti-coagulation with Coumadin for known DVT/PE and endocarditis
   now treated with very reassuring TEE showing absence of vegitation.
   Her medical management has been maintenance of chronic levels of
   support for non-invasive ventilatory support.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Chronic and related to obestity and sleep related
   hypoventilation
   -BIPAP with any period of sleep
   2)DVT/PE-
   -Continue Coumadin

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of DVT/PE, endocarditis, and behavioral disturbances. She has been in the ICU for a prolonged period and requires intermittent ventilatory support with BIPAP. She is on long-term anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin.

The patient's medical management includes maintaining chronic levels of support for non-invasive ventilatory support, continuing Coumadin for DVT/PE, completing a course of Linezolid for endocarditis, and seeking psychiatric input for behavioral disorder management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to obesity and sleep-related hypoventilation, impaired skin integrity, fungal infection, pain control, ineffective coping, pulmonary embolism (PE), bacteremia, chest pain, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and impaired cardiac function.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration in her respiratory status, skin integrity, and wound healing. Regular assessment of her coagulation profile should be done to ensure appropriate anticoagulation therapy. Psychological support and input from psychiatry should be continued to manage her behavioral disturbances.

The patient's nutritional status should be monitored, and efforts should be made to maintain optimal glycemic control. Pain management and effective coping strategies should be implemented to improve her overall well-being. Close monitoring for any signs of infection, such as bacteremia or fungal infections, is essential. Regular imaging studies may be necessary"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels
   she needs them but must comply w/EKG prior to Droperidol and O2
   monitor/Bipap prior to Ativan.  Per discussion in the team meeting on
   [**1-7**]-hour security guard was discontinued as she has demonstrated
   better behavioral control over the last several days.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely
   agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation as needed
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   .
   # sleep apnea: Has history of somnolence from hypercarbia and
   subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP.  This was likely
   the case on her first intubation during her prior admission, however,
   subsequent intubations were with blood gases that were within the range
   of normal for her.  The patient has refused to use BiPAP and
   supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the past week and when she
   wears the monitor (which she also refuses at times) O2 sat is usually
   >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  She does occasionally desat to
   the 70s or 60s ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4004**] [**Location (un) **] is sometimes poor), but recovers
   spontaneously.  From a medical standpoint, the patient would benefit
   from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly demonstrated that she is in no
   imminent danger when not wearing it and she consistently refuses to
   wear it.  The change in her psychiatric medications with less sedating
   medications have likely helped in this regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be psychogenic and not true medical
   emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications.
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode [**1-8**].  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated.  They
   recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity, however, the
   patient has refused this splint.  Plastics does not feel that a hard
   cast is indicated.  Reduction can be performed at bedside by medical
   team. Last night PT reduced finger and provided a hard splint.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   .
   # Hx of positive blood cultures: Now w/2 weeks of negative BCx and
   patient just finished course of treatment with linezolid (though
   intermittently compliant) on [**1-6**].  Patient has been afebrile
   throughout her entire treatment course.  Documentation from Shattock
   showed staph simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus was resistant
   to vanc.  The two bacteria together are only both sensitive to
   linezolid and rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to
   vancomycin.   TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular
   vegetations.   Nidus of infection was unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.
   Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in
   cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no
   DVT.  Dental panorex negative for abscess.
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]):
   - coumadin was increased to 3 mg on [**12-30**].  INR is therapeutic, will
   continue to give Coumadin at 3mg and monitor.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   Other complaints [**Known firstname 3971**] has had intermittently during her hospital stay:
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  Has improved.  C. diff
   negative x 3.  Stool O&P negative x 2.  Now just
loose stool
   - Treating with Immodium
   - Bowel regimen only prn.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: Likely secondary to above.  LFTs, amylase, lipase all
   normal. UA normal.  Stable.  No need for further evaluation at this
   time.
   .
   #
Chilliness
: Patient complains of being cold in her room x 5 days
   despite the heat being turned up.  TSH was 2.2 on [**2156-12-9**].
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this was an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT. Seems to have resolved as patient is no longer
   complaining.
   .
   #Pruritis: could be due to increase frequency of bathing leading to dry
   skin. No rashes noted. No new meds to explain pruritis.
   -Sarna TID
   -Attarax x1 dose
   -Avoiding benadryl b/c of potential sedating effects. Would say patient
   should be monitored by O2 sat monitor if she gets benadryl.
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1. She has been admitted to the ICU again with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain, worst in the left upper quadrant (LUQ), after starting fluconazole for a vaginal yeast infection. The patient has a history of psychiatric disorders, including axis I and axis II disorders. She continues to refuse medical treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood draws, and Coumadin doses. The patient has shown better behavioral control in recent days, and a security guard was discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Psychiatric Disorders: The patient's history of psychiatric disorders may lead to acute agitation and refusal of necessary medical treatments. There is a plan to use restraints and sedating medications like droperidol and ativan for acute agitation if needed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and asthma. She requires BiPAP for sleep apnea, but has consistently refused to wear it. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels is necessary during episodes of unresponsiveness.
3. DVT/PE: The patient has a history of DVT and PE. She has a partially occluded thrombus in the cephalic vein, which may serve as"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels
   she needs them but must comply w/EKG prior to Droperidol and O2
   monitor/Bipap prior to Ativan.  Per discussion in the team meeting on
   [**1-7**]-hour security guard was discontinued as she has demonstrated
   better behavioral control over the last several days.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely
   agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation as needed
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   .
   # sleep apnea w/insomnia and refusal to wear BiPAP: Has history of
   somnolence from hypercarbia and subsequent intubation when she does not
   use her BiPAP.  This was likely the case on her first intubation during
   her prior admission, however, subsequent intubations were with blood
   gases that were within the range of normal for her.  The patient has
   refused to use BiPAP and supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the
   past 2 weeks and when she wears the monitor (which she also refuses
   usually) O2 sat is usually >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  She
   does occasionally desat to the 70s or 60s ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4004**] [**Location (un) **] is sometimes
   poor), but recovers spontaneously.  From a medical standpoint, the
   patient would benefit from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly
   demonstrated that she is in no imminent danger when not wearing it and
   she consistently refuses to wear it.  The change in her psychiatric
   medications with less sedating medications have likely helped in this
   regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be
   psychogenic and not true medical emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).   Now
   c/o HA that could be related to not wearing bipap.
   - encourage bipap nightly
   - encourage O2 sat monitoring nightly
   - no Ambien as we want to reserve the possibility of using Ativan in
   emergency situations and do not want to mix sedating meds.
   - Ativan 0.5mg prn QHS for insomnia ONLY if patient agrees to Bipap, O2
   sat monitoring
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications
   - to consider repeat sleep study
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]):
   - coumadin was increased to 4 mg today b/c INR was subtherapeutic
   today.
   - Follow PT/INR daily
   .
   # Hx of positive blood cultures: Now w/2 weeks of negative BCx and
   patient just finished course of treatment with linezolid (though
   intermittently compliant) on [**1-6**].  Patient has been afebrile
   throughout her entire treatment course.  Documentation from Shattock
   showed staph simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus was resistant
   to vanc.  The two bacteria together are only both sensitive to
   linezolid and rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to
   vancomycin.   TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular
   vegetations.   Nidus of infection was unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.
   Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in
   cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no
   DVT.  Dental panorex negative for abscess.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   # HA: could be related to not wearing BiPap, poor sleep cycle.
   - Encourage bipap
   - Tylenol, motrin, utram prn
   .
   # Abdominal pain: LFTs, amylase, lipase normal. UA normal. Afebrile.
   Likely due to poor diet.
   - Encourage healthy diet (less hot dogs)
   .
   Other complaints [**Known firstname 3971**] has had intermittently during her hospital stay:
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode [**1-8**].  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated and does
   not require emergent/urgent reduction if happens in the middle of the
   night.  They recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity,
   however, the patient has refused this splint in the past.  A few nights
   ago, PT reduced finger and provided a hard splint (unclear if this is
   the same one plastics recommended) although patient does not wear it.
   Reduction can be performed at bedside by medical team.  Note that
   plastic surgery does not feel that a hard cast is indicated, although
   she will often ask for one.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   - outpatient orthopedic correction of ligamentous injury/congenital
   defect (patient asks about surgery while inpatient at [**Hospital1 19**] and has
   been reminded several times that this is not something she needs to
   have done while she is in the hospital now).
   .
   #Diarrhea: Most likely antibiotic side effect.  Has improved.  C. diff
   negative x 3.  Stool O&P negative x 2.  Now just
loose stool
   - Treating with Immodium
   - Bowel regimen only prn.
   .
   # Polydypsia/polyuria: blood glucose normal. Patient with high PO fluid
   intake. No need to eval further
   .
   # Hormone
irregularities
 including hot flashes. [**Known firstname 3971**] has been
   advised that she should f/u with an endocrinologist outpatient.
   .
   #
Chilliness
: Patient complains of being cold in her room x 5 days
   despite the heat being turned up.  TSH was 2.2 on [**2156-12-9**].
   .
   # LUE thrombus: superficial; may be nidus for infection
   - anticoagulated with coumadin
   .
   # Left shoulder pain: Patient complained of left shoulder pain.
   Unclear if this was an attempt to get attention or is real. Patient has
   full ROM of shoulder. Unnecessary to have films at this point.  Motrin
   and outpatient PT. Seems to have resolved as patient is no longer
   complaining.
   .
   #Pruritis: could be due to increase frequency of bathing leading to dry
   skin. No rashes noted. No new meds to explain pruritis.
   -Sarna TID
   -Attarax x1 dose
   -Avoiding benadryl b/c of potential sedating effects. Would say patient
   should be monitored by O2 sat monitor if she gets benadryl.
   .
   # Vaginal yeast infection: miconazole vaginal cream daily x 7 days
   (started [**12-26**])
   .
   # Restless leg syndrome: was on Requip, now changing to Gabapentin
   100mg QHS.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Prilosec, heparin/coumadin, bowel regimen held b/c of
   diarrhea
   .
   # FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
   .
   # Access: PICC line placement by IR on [**12-30**].
   .
   # Code Status: Full

   # Dispo: ICU.  Guardianship in progress.  Search for psychiatric
   placement is in process.   To consider call-out to the floor tomorrow

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels
   she needs them but must comply w/EKG prior to Droperidol and O2
   monitor/Bipap prior to Ativan.  Per discussion in the team meeting on
   [**1-7**]-hour security guard was discontinued as she has demonstrated
   better behavioral control over the last several days.   12/1-2
   overnight put in 4 pt restrains after spits after pt upset we did not
   feel mouth lesion required sutures.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely
   agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation as needed
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   .
   # sleep apnea w/insomnia and refusal to wear BiPAP: Has history of
   somnolence from hypercarbia and subsequent intubation when she does not
   use her BiPAP.  This was likely the case on her first intubation during
   her prior admission, however, subsequent intubations were with blood
   gases that were within the range of normal for her.  The patient has
   refused to use BiPAP and supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the
   past 2 weeks and when she wears the monitor (which she also refuses
   usually) O2 sat is usually >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  She
   does occasionally desat to the 70s or 60s ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4004**] [**Location (un) **] is sometimes
   poor), but recovers spontaneously.  From a medical standpoint, the
   patient would benefit from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly
   demonstrated that she is in no imminent danger when not wearing it and
   she consistently refuses to wear it.  The change in her psychiatric
   medications with less sedating medications have likely helped in this
   regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be
   psychogenic and not true medical emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).   Now
   c/o HA that could be related to not wearing bipap.
   - encourage bipap nightly
   - encourage O2 sat monitoring nightly
   - no Ambien as we want to reserve the possibility of using Ativan in
   emergency situations and do not want to mix sedating meds.
   - Ativan 0.5mg prn QHS for insomnia ONLY if patient agrees to Bipap, O2
   sat monitoring
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications
   - to consider repeat sleep study
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]):
   - coumadin was increased to 4 mg today b/c INR was subtherapeutic
   today.
   - Follow PT/INR daily
   .
   # Hx of positive blood cultures: Now w/2 weeks of negative BCx and
   patient just finished course of treatment with linezolid (though
   intermittently compliant) on [**1-6**].  Patient has been afebrile
   throughout her entire treatment course.  Documentation from Shattock
   showed staph simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus was resistant
   to vanc.  The two bacteria together are only both sensitive to
   linezolid and rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to
   vancomycin.   TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular
   vegetations.   Nidus of infection was unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.
   Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in
   cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no
   DVT.  Dental panorex negative for abscess.
   .
   # lip mucosa injury: bit her lip, wound small, superficial, and largely
   closed already. Sutures are not indicated.
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   # HA: could be related to not wearing BiPap, poor sleep cycle.
   - Encourage bipap
   - Tylenol, motrin, utram prn
   .
   # Abdominal pain: LFTs, amylase, lipase normal. UA normal. Afebrile.
   Likely due to poor diet.
   - Encourage healthy diet (less hot dogs)
   .
   Other complaints [**Known firstname 3971**] has had intermittently during her hospital stay:
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode [**1-8**].  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated and does
   not require emergent/urgent reduction if happens in the middle of the
   night.  They recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity,
   however, the patient has refused this splint in the past.  A few nights
   ago, PT reduced finger and provided a hard splint (unclear if this is
   the same one plastics recommended) although patient does not wear it.
   Reduction can be performed at bedside by medical team.  Note that
   plastic surgery does not feel that a hard cast is indicated, although
   she will often ask for one.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), recent admission to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, and leaving against medical advice (AMA) from Hospital1. She has been admitted to the ICU again due to recent fevers and documented bacteremia. The patient refuses medical treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood draws, and Coumadin doses.

Medical Complications:
1. Psychiatric disorder: The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders. There have been instances where she physically harmed medical team members, and she continues to refuse necessary medical treatments. Psych consult and assistance with management are appreciated. Restraints may be used if needed, with prior approval from an attending physician.

2. Sleep apnea with insomnia: The patient has a history of somnolence from hypercarbia and subsequent intubation when she does not use her BiPAP. She refuses to wear BiPAP and supplemental oxygen by nasal canula. Despite occasional desaturation episodes, she does not seem to be in imminent danger when not wearing it. Encourage the use of BiPAP nightly and monitor O2 saturation.

3. History of positive blood cultures: The patient had positive blood cultures showing staph simulans and enterococcus, which were resistant to vancomycin. She completed a course of linezolid"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 year-old morbidly obese female with hx asthma,
   h/o of DVT/PE, recent admission to ICU for hypercarbic resp failure,
   here after leaving AMA from [**Hospital1 **] with her usual CP, recent fevers,
   and recent documentation of bacteremia, continues to refuse medical
   treatments periodically, including monitoring, antibiotics, blood
   draws, and coumadin doses.
   .
   #1 Psych: history of axis I and axis II disorders. Psych consult and
   assistance with management appreciated.  As patient has physically
   harmed medical team members and continues to refuse necessary medical
   treatments (IV access, antibiotics) there will be a low threshold to
   use restraints and give Droperidol and Ativan for acute agitation if
   needed.  Patient is allowed to request these medications if she feels
   she needs them but must comply w/EKG prior to Droperidol and O2
   monitor/Bipap prior to Ativan.  Per discussion in the team meeting on
   [**1-7**]-hour security guard was discontinued as she has demonstrated
   better behavioral control over the last several days.
   Plan to deal with [**Known firstname 3971**]
s acute agitation:
   - give her a 20 minute cool-off for initial agitation (do not try to
   reason through things, only makes her more agitated), return after 20
   minutes to discuss care
   - encourage distraction techniques (tv, music)
   - Acute agitation: droperidol 1.25mg IV (can give 2.5 mg if extremely
   agitated) or ativan 0.5 - 1 mg IV
   - MUST wear bipap if ANY sedating meds given
   - hospital security observation as needed
   - Daily f/u psych recommendations for change in plan
   - Guardianship paperwork in the hands of the legal department; at this
   point we are legally allowed to provide care against her will only in
   an emergency situation. Otherwise give care as medically indicated and
   patient can refuse if she chooses.  Per legal, guardianship process is
   underway.
   - EKG & electrolytes if receives Geodon or droperidol
   .
   # sleep apnea w/insomnia and refusal to wear BiPAP: Has history of
   somnolence from hypercarbia and subsequent intubation when she does not
   use her BiPAP.  This was likely the case on her first intubation during
   her prior admission, however, subsequent intubations were with blood
   gases that were within the range of normal for her.  The patient has
   refused to use BiPAP and supplemental oxygen by nasal canula for the
   past 2 weeks and when she wears the monitor (which she also refuses
   usually) O2 sat is usually >88% when she is sleeping on room air.  She
   does occasionally desat to the 70s or 60s ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4004**] [**Location (un) **] is sometimes
   poor), but recovers spontaneously.  From a medical standpoint, the
   patient would benefit from wearing her BiPAP, but has clearly
   demonstrated that she is in no imminent danger when not wearing it and
   she consistently refuses to wear it.  The change in her psychiatric
   medications with less sedating medications have likely helped in this
   regard.  Her most recent
unresponsive
 episodes appear to be
   psychogenic and not true medical emergencies (O2 sat in mid 90s).   Now
   c/o HA that could be related to not wearing bipap.
   - encourage bipap nightly
   - encourage O2 sat monitoring nightly
   - no Ambien as we want to reserve the possibility of using Ativan in
   emergency situations and do not want to mix sedating meds.
   - Ativan 0.5mg prn QHS for insomnia ONLY if patient agrees to Bipap, O2
   sat monitoring
   - When patient has an
unresponsive
 episode while sleeping, check O2
   sat, if > 88%, no indication for intubation.
   - pt should wear BiPAP after receiving sedating medications
   - to consider repeat sleep study
   .
   # hx PE ([**Date range (1) 3973**] DVT of R subclavian, brachial veins, and PE Dx at
   Caritas [**Hospital3 **]):
   - coumadin was increased to 4 mg today b/c INR was subtherapeutic
   today.
   - Follow PT/INR daily
   .
   # Hx of positive blood cultures: Now w/2 weeks of negative BCx and
   patient just finished course of treatment with linezolid (though
   intermittently compliant) on [**1-6**].  Patient has been afebrile
   throughout her entire treatment course.  Documentation from Shattock
   showed staph simulans and enterococcus.  The enterococcus was resistant
   to vanc.  The two bacteria together are only both sensitive to
   linezolid and rifampin.  Two blood cultures here are sensitive to
   vancomycin.   TEE Echo showed no endocarditis or valvular
   vegetations.   Nidus of infection was unclear.  CXR w/no infiltrate.
   Urine culture negative.  RUE U/S showing partially occluded thrombus in
   cephalic vein, possible nidus of infection.  LUE ultrasound shows no
   DVT.  Dental panorex negative for abscess.
   .
   # COPD/asthma:
   - nebs/inhalers as needed
   .
   # HA: could be related to not wearing BiPap, poor sleep cycle.
   - Encourage bipap
   - Tylenol, motrin, utram prn
   .
   # Abdominal pain: LFTs, amylase, lipase normal. UA normal. Afebrile.
   Likely due to poor diet.
   - Encourage healthy diet (less hot dogs)
   .
   Other complaints [**Known firstname 3971**] has had intermittently during her hospital stay:
   .
   # Finger subluxation: Has repeatedly subluxed her R ring finger when
   attempting to push herself up from bed or off the bedpan.  Most recent
   episode [**1-8**].  Plastics consulted multiple times and finger xrays
   performed.  Per plastics, the finger is not truly dislocated and does
   not require emergent/urgent reduction if happens in the middle of the
   night.  They recommend a special splint for her swan neck deformity,
   however, the patient has refused this splint in the past.  A few nights
   ago, PT reduced finger and provided a hard splint (unclear if this is
   the same one plastics recommended) although patient does not wear it.
   Reduction can be performed at bedside by medical team.  Note that
   plastic surgery does not feel that a hard cast is indicated, although
   she will often ask for one.
   - tylenol/ibuprofen PRN pain
   - ultram prn pain
   - NO percocet for pain given sedating side effects, patient
s history
   of using these medicines to bargain/manipulate care.
   - outpatient orthopedic correction of ligamentous injury/congenital
   defect (patient asks about surgery while inpatient at [**Hospital1 19**] and has
   been reminded several times that this is not something she needs to
   have done while she is in the hospital now).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Psychiatric disorder: The patient has a history of axis I and axis II disorders, which may contribute to her refusal of medical treatments and aggressive behavior towards medical staff.
2. Infection: The patient has documented bacteremia and fevers, indicating a potential ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure and has a history of asthma. Poor control of her respiratory condition can lead to further respiratory compromise.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of DVT and PE. Anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin is necessary to prevent new thromboembolic events.
5. Sleep apnea: The patient has a history of insomnia and refusal to wear BiPAP, which can lead to unresponsive episodes and potential respiratory arrest during"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including psychiatric disease, impaired skin integrity, fungal infection, pain control, ineffective coping, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), bacteremia, chest pain, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and others. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where a blood clot blocks one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and watch for any signs of shortness of breath, chest pain, or difficulty breathing.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of bacteremia, which is the presence of bacteria in the blood. This can lead to systemic infection and sepsis. Monitoring the patient's vital signs, temperature, and white blood cell count is crucial to detect any signs of infection.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and other complications related to skin breakdown. Regular turning and proper skin care are essential to prevent further skin damage.

4. Fungal infection: The patient has a fungal infection, which can worsen if not appropriately"
