   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This 80M with COPD, pulmonary fibrosis,
   Parkinsons, and TBM s/p stenting returns with increased respiratory
   distress.
   1. Dyspnea:
   History concerning for possible pneumonia given fever and cough. His
   CXR shows no clear infiltrate, which raises the possibility of an
   atypical bacterial infection or viral pneumonia such as influenza. In
   the setting of recent hospitalization and rehab, health care associated
   pathogens much be addressed and could have been easily missed with
   recent ceftriaxone, azithromycin. In setting of Parkinsons, may be
   prone to aspiration. Other possibilities include recurrent mucous
   plugging, COPD exacerbation. He certainly may have an element of HF.
   ACS, PE seems less likely.
   - Gram stain and culture of sputum, DFA with respiratory viral panel
   - Urine legionella antigen, blood cultures
   - Empiric vancomycin and Zosyn, plus levoflox (recently got azithro)
   - Continue bronchodilators, mucomyst nebs
   - Chest PT
   - Check ABG
   - PA/Lat CXR when stabilizes
   - Hold on further diuresis for now
   - Recheck BNP
   - Consider swallow eval
   .
   2. Fever
   Suspect due pulmonary infection, as above. No diarrhea to suggest C
   diff, UA without evidence of UTI. Other noninfectious causes such as PE
   seem less likely.
   - Pulmonary workup as above
   - UA/UCX, blood cultures
   .
   3. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Labs suggestive of a pre-renal picture in setting of diuresis, poor PO
   - Hold on further diuresis
   - Urinalysis, urine electrolytes
   - Follow urine output, renally dose meds
   - Hold lisinopril
   .
   4. HTN
   Holding lisinopril in setting of elevated Cr. Continue diltiazem.
   .
   5. Parkinsons
   Continue home Sinemet
   .
   6. PVD s/p stent
   Continue home warfarin, ASA, statin. Will discuss need for warfarin
   with vascular.
   .
   7. Depression/Anxiety
   Continue duloxetine
   .
   8. Hyperlipidemia
   Continuing home statin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, Parkinson's disease, and tracheobronchial malignancy. He was admitted with dyspnea and has been experiencing increased respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/115 mmHg to 120/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral rales in the lungs, more prominent on the right side, along with expiratory wheezing. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. His chest X-ray shows mild congestive heart failure and a tracheal stent that appears to lie slightly to the left.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to possible pneumonia, atypical bacterial infection, or viral pneumonia such as influenza. Other possibilities include recurrent mucous plugging, COPD exacerbation, and an element of heart failure. The plan includes obtaining gram stain and culture of sputum, DFA with respiratory viral panel, urine legionella antigen, and blood cultures. Empiric vancomycin and Zosyn, plus levofloxacin, will be administered. Chest PT, ABG, and PA/Lat CXR when the patient stabilizes are also planned.

2. Fever: The patient's fever is suspected to be due to pulmonary infection. Noninfectious causes such as pulmonary embolism seem less likely. The planned workup includes pulmonary evaluation as mentioned above, along with UA/UCX and blood cultures.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's labs suggest a pre-renal picture in the setting of diuresis and poor oral intake. The plan includes holding further diuresis, performing urinalysis and urine electrolytes, following urine output, and renally dosing medications. Lisinopril will be held due to elevated creatinine levels.

4. HTN: Lisinopril will be held in the setting of elevated creatinine levels. Diltiazem will be continued.

5. Parkinson's disease: The patient's home regimen of Sinemet will be continued.

6. PVD s/p stent: The patient will continue on home warfarin, ASA, and statin. Discussion with vascular will be made regarding the need for warfarin.

7. Depression/Anxiety: Duloxetine will be continued.

8. Hyperlipidemia: Home statin therapy will be continued.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: Regular diet, NPO after midnight for possible bronchoscopic procedure.
- Glycemic control: Blood sugar well controlled.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, Parkinson's disease, and tuberculous meningitis who returns with increased respiratory distress. The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea. The patient has been experiencing fever and cough, raising concerns for possible pneumonia. The chest X-ray does not show any clear infiltrate, which could indicate an atypical bacterial infection or viral pneumonia such as influenza. Given the recent hospitalization and rehab stay, healthcare-associated pathogens need to be considered. The patient may also be prone to aspiration due to Parkinson's disease. Other possible causes of the respiratory distress include recurrent mucous plugging, COPD exacerbation, and congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 99.8°F (37.7°C), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 135/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% face mask. The physical examination shows mild tachypnea but the patient is able to converse, bilateral rales minimal on the right and coarse on the left, no jugular venous distention, mildly tachycardic regular S1 S2 without murmurs or gallops appreciated, soft nontender abdomen with normal bowel sounds, warm extremities without edema or distal pulses, and alert and awake with good neurological examination.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, Parkinson's disease, and tracheobronchial malfunction (TBMS) who was admitted with increased respiratory distress. He has a chief complaint of dyspnea and is suspected to have pneumonia. His CXR shows mild CHF and tracheal stent migration. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 135/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an aerosol-cool device. Physical examination reveals bilateral rales, more prominent on the right side, along with some expiratory wheeze. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Dyspnea: The patient may have an atypical bacterial infection or viral pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration in the setting of Parkinson's disease. Other possibilities include recurrent mucous plugging, COPD exacerbation, or heart failure. Further investigations include gram stain and culture of sputum, DFA with respiratory viral panel, urine legionella antigen, blood cultures, and a chest PT.
2. Fever: The patient is suspected to have a pulmonary infection. Noninfectious causes such as pulmonary embolism seem less likely. Pulmonary workup as mentioned above is recommended.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, Parkinson's disease, and tuberculous meningitis who was admitted with dyspnea. The patient has been experiencing increased respiratory distress and is suspected of having pneumonia. There are no clear infiltrates on the chest X-ray, so atypical bacterial infection or viral pneumonia such as influenza is a possibility. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and is currently receiving empiric vancomycin, Zosyn, and levofloxacin. 

The patient's fever is also attributed to a pulmonary infection. Other potential causes such as pulmonary embolism seem less likely. The patient's renal function has worsened, indicating acute on chronic renal failure. Diuretics have been held and further evaluation is needed. The patient's hypertension medication, lisinopril, has also been held due to elevated creatinine levels. 

The patient's Parkinson's disease medication, Sinemet, has been continued. His stent in the peripheral vascular disease has been discussed, and he will continue on warfarin, ASA, and statin. The patient's depression/anxiety medication, duloxetine, has also been continued. His hyperlipidemia medication, statin, will be continued as well.

The patient is currently receiving nutrition through a regular diet and is NPO after midnight for possible bronchoscopic procedure. Blood sugar levels have been well controlled. The patient has multiple IV lines and is on systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor and ventilation-associated pneumonia prevention with elevation of the head of bed."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemi diaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia with a stent placed. He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. The patient is currently being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). His vital signs show tachypnea and central expiratory wheeze. Physical examination reveals multiple excoriations on limbs. Lab results indicate acute on chronic renal failure, and imaging shows bronchiectasis and tracheal malacia without evidence of pulmonary fibrosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress, tachypnea, and central expiratory wheeze indicate potential respiratory failure. The presence of bronchiectasis and tracheal malacia increases the risk of airway obstruction and impaired gas exchange.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Given his history of bronchiectasis and tracheal malacia, he is at higher risk for recurrent or chronic lung infections.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The lab results indicate acute on chronic renal failure. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and further complications such as hypertension or cardiac issues.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, renal failure, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/72 mmHg to 177/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation and receives multiple medications, including opioids, benzodiazepines, and antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 229 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 102 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL indicating renal dysfunction. The patient also has hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level of 146 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (non-ventilator-associated pneumonia), acute renal failure, benign hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing antibiotic-resistant organisms and complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical"

The patient has been started on non-invasive ventilation and has undergone sputum cultures and nasal swabs. Allergies include opioids, confusion/delirium, sulfa (sulfonamides), tetanus, benzodiazepines, and confusion/delirium. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/72 to 177/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Physical examination reveals tachypnea, central expiratory wheeze, increased rales in the right lower lobe, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated, soft abdomen, no jugular venous distention, multiple excoriations on limbs, increased tone, mild rigidity, and masked facies. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, sodium of 146 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 95 mg/dL. 

The patient's sputum culture has grown yeast and oral flora. 

Assessment and plan include pneumonia, suspecting healthcare-associated, continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, performing a pan culture, and discussing bronchoscopy with the intensivist. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and glycemic control issues."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemi diaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia with a stent placed. He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia. His acute kidney injury has improved, and he is being kept euvolemic. His anticoagulation therapy is being held due to an upcoming procedure. The patient's Parkinson's disease medications need confirmation with the rehab team. The patient is NPO for possible bronchoscopy and will continue standing Atrovent and prn albuterol. He will be monitored closely for glycemic control while on steroids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray suggest pneumonia. Given his hospitalization, there is a risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia, which requires appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Tracheal stent migration: The chest x-ray shows that the tracheal stent appears to lie slightly to the left relative to the tracheal contour. A CT scan of the chest is suggested to exclude tracheal stent migration, which can lead to airway obstruction.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline serum creatinine (SCr) was around"

   Assessment and Plan: This 80M with COPD, pulmonary fibrosis,
   Parkinsons, and TBM s/p stenting returns with increased respiratory
   distress.
   1. Dyspnea:
   History concerning for possible pneumonia given fever and cough. His
   CXR shows no clear infiltrate, which raises the possibility of an
   atypical bacterial infection or viral pneumonia such as influenza. In
   the setting of recent hospitalization and rehab, health care associated
   pathogens much be addressed and could have been easily missed with
   recent ceftriaxone, azithromycin. In setting of Parkinsons, may be
   prone to aspiration. Other possibilities include recurrent mucous
   plugging, COPD exacerbation. He certainly may have an element of HF.
   ACS, PE seems less likely.
   - Gram stain and culture of sputum, DFA with respiratory viral panel
   - Urine legionella antigen, blood cultures
   - Empiric vancomycin and Zosyn, plus levoflox (recently got azithro)
   - Continue bronchodilators, mucomyst nebs
   - Chest PT
   - Check ABG
   - PA/Lat CXR when stabilizes
   - Hold on further diuresis for now
   - Recheck BNP
   - Consider swallow eval
   .
   2. Fever
   Suspect due pulmonary infection, as above. No diarrhea to suggest C
   diff, UA without evidence of UTI. Other noninfectious causes such as PE
   seem less likely.
   - Pulmonary workup as above
   - UA/UCX, blood cultures
   .
   3. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Labs suggestive of a pre-renal picture in setting of diuresis, poor PO
   - Hold on further diuresis
   - Urinalysis, urine electrolytes
   - Follow urine output, renally dose meds
   - Hold lisinopril
   .
   4. HTN
   Holding lisinopril in setting of elevated Cr. Continue diltiazem.
   .
   5. Parkinsons
   Continue home Sinemet
   .
   6. PVD s/p stent
   Continue home warfarin, ASA, statin. Will discuss need for warfarin
   with vascular.
   .
   7. Depression/Anxiety
   Continue duloxetine
   .
   8. Hyperlipidemia

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2148-5-28**]. There have been several changes in antibiotics due to the patient's history of ESBL e.coli in the sputum. The patient is currently on meropenem, vancomycin, and prednisone. Sinemet has been restarted, and aspirin has been increased to 325mg daily. The INR level was measured at 2.4, and a second dose of vitamin K 5mg PO was given. The patient is planned for possible [**Location (un)**] placement. The patient is out of bed in a chair. 

Allergies include opioid analgesics, confusion/delirium, sulfonamides, unknown tetanus, benzodiazepines, and confusion/delirium. 

Last doses of antibiotics were piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2148-5-29**] at 04:55 AM, levofloxacin on [**2148-5-29**] at 12:00 PM, vancomycin on [**2148-5-29**] at 02:57 PM, and meropenem on [**2148-5-29**] at 11:13 PM.

   Assessment and Plan: This 80M with COPD, pulmonary fibrosis,
   Parkinsons, and TBM s/p stenting returns with increased respiratory
   distress.
   1. Dyspnea:
   History concerning for possible pneumonia given fever and cough. His
   CXR shows no clear infiltrate, which raises the possibility of an
   atypical bacterial infection or viral pneumonia such as influenza. In
   the setting of recent hospitalization and rehab, health care associated
   pathogens much be addressed and could have been easily missed with
   recent ceftriaxone, azithromycin. In setting of Parkinsons, may be
   prone to aspiration. Other possibilities include recurrent mucous
   plugging, COPD exacerbation. He certainly may have an element of HF.
   ACS, PE seems less likely.
   - Gram stain and culture of sputum, DFA with respiratory viral panel
   - Urine legionella antigen, blood cultures
   - Empiric vancomycin and Zosyn, plus levoflox (recently got azithro)
   - Continue bronchodilators, mucomyst nebs
   - Chest PT
   - Check ABG
   - PA/Lat CXR when stabilizes
   - Hold on further diuresis for now
   - Recheck BNP
   - Consider swallow eval
   .
   2. Fever
   Suspect due pulmonary infection, as above. No diarrhea to suggest C
   diff, UA without evidence of UTI. Other noninfectious causes such as PE
   seem less likely.
   - Pulmonary workup as above
   - UA/UCX, blood cultures
   .
   3. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Labs suggestive of a pre-renal picture in setting of diuresis, poor PO
   - Hold on further diuresis
   - Urinalysis, urine electrolytes
   - Follow urine output, renally dose meds
   - Hold lisinopril
   .
   4. HTN
   Holding lisinopril in setting of elevated Cr. Continue diltiazem.
   .
   5. Parkinsons
   Continue home Sinemet
   .
   6. PVD s/p stent
   Continue home warfarin, ASA, statin. Will discuss need for warfarin
   with vascular.
   .
   7. Depression/Anxiety
   Continue duloxetine
   .
   8. Hyperlipidemia
   Continuing home statin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, Parkinson's disease, and tuberculous meningitis. The patient was admitted with increased respiratory distress and is suspected to have pneumonia. The patient's chest X-ray does not show clear infiltrates, which raises the possibility of atypical bacterial infection or viral pneumonia like influenza. The patient's recent hospitalization and rehabilitation stay increase the risk of healthcare-associated pathogens.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/62 to 177/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show pH at 7.42, PaCO2 at 38 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 183.

The patient's laboratory values show a white blood cell count of 8.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, sodium level of 154 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 95 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated PT and PTT levels, slightly low oxygen saturation, and normal calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemi diaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia with a stent placed. He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, suspected to be healthcare-associated. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the antibiotic plan will be adjusted based on sensitivity results. The patient's condition has improved since admission, with improvements in vital signs and laboratory values. However, he still requires respiratory support and has ongoing management for other medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease and Parkinson's disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient's low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray suggest an infection. The presence of a healthcare-associated pneumonia is suspected, which can be caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms commonly found in hospitals. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the sensitivity results will guide further adjustments in the antibiotic plan.

2. Tracheostomy: The patient is planned for a tracheostomy and bronchoscopy. As this is an invasive procedure, there is a risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, trauma to the airway or vocal cords, and damage to surrounding structures. Pre-procedural preparations and intraoperative care will be crucial in minimizing these risks.

3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemi diaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia with stent placement. He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, suspected to be healthcare-associated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, pending sensitivities. The patient's kidney function has improved from a baseline SCr of ~1.0 to 1.4. He is also being treated for chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and Parkinson's disease. The patient is currently NPO for a procedure and will undergo a bronch and tracheal procedure in [**Location (un)**]. His vital signs are stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor post-procedure if a tracheostomy is allowed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can potentially worsen if not effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's kidney function has worsened from a baseline SCr of ~1.0 to 1.5, indicating acute kidney injury. This requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
3. Tracheal Procedure: The patient is scheduled for a bronch and tracheal procedure, which carries risks such as bleeding,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemi diaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia. He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently being treated for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia. Antibiotics have been changed based on sensitivities. The patient's condition has improved, but potential medical complications include pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and Parkinson's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have healthcare-associated pneumonia. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and wait for the results of the sensitivity testing to guide further antibiotic treatment.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (CKD): The patient's baseline serum creatinine level was approximately 1.0, but it has increased to 1.5. The recent improvement to 1.4 is a positive sign. It is essential to maintain euvolemia and closely monitor the patient's kidney function.

3. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient is currently on Coumadin/ASA for PVD. However, the vascular surgeon has advised holding Coumadin during the bronch procedure and can be restarted afterward. The patient should continue taking ASA 325mg.

4. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease medications need to be confirmed with the rehab team. The current medication"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemi diaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia with a stent placed. The patient presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms such as low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Given the patient's history of COPD and bronchiectasis, healthcare-associated pneumonia should be considered.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline serum creatinine (SCr) was around 1.0, but it presented with a value of 1.5. This indicates a potential acute on chronic kidney disease (CKD). The improvement to SCr 1.4 on May 29th suggests that the AKI is being managed.
3. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): The patient is on coumadin/ASA for PVD. However, the plan is to hold coumadin per vascular surgeon's email communication in case of bronchoscopic procedures, which can be restarted afterward. 
4. Parkinson's disease: The patient is on sinemet for Parkinson's disease, and confirmation of adding Parkinson's medications with rehab is noted on May 29th.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemidiaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia. He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, suspected to be healthcare-associated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover Gram-negative rods, including ESBL E. coli, and atypical pathogens.

The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease (CKD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), Parkinson's disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is currently receiving various medications for these conditions, including prednisone for COPD, statins for CKD and hyperlipidemia, warfarin for PVD, and sinemet for Parkinson's disease.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125-153/27-86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool delivery. His physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, generalized peribronchial cuffing suggestive of left heart decompensation, and muscle wasting.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, as well as"

","The patient's chief complaint is dyspnea. The patient has a history of several medical conditions including pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia. The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing care.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/27 mmHg to 153/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals fatigue, dry mucous membranes, crackles at the bases of the lungs, and a feeding tube in place. The patient's extremities are absent on the right side and present on the left side. There is also muscle wasting noted.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging reveals evolving airspace changes suggestive of pneumonia.

Microbiology tests indicate the presence of multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora, as well as a moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora and gram-negative rods, including Proteus species.

The patient's assessment and plan include pneumonia, which is hospital-acquired and non-ventilator-associated, acute renal failure, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia. The patient is receiving ICU care"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemidiaphragm paralysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia. He is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea. 

The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray, suggesting pneumonia. The sputum culture results show the presence of multiple organisms consistent with oropharyngeal flora and budding yeast with pseudohyphae. The respiratory culture reveals moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora and sparse growth of gram-negative rods, including Proteus species.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with decreased hematocrit. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are also elevated. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray showing evolving airspace changes in the right mid zone, suggestive of pneumonia, as well as generalized peribronchial cuffing indicative of left heart decompensation. A port chest X-ray from May 29th is also mentioned.

The patient's medical history includes COPD, tracheal malacia with stent placement, acute kidney injury (CKD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), Parkinson's disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression"

He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, suspected to be healthcare-associated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, with plans to tailor the treatment based on sensitivities. The patient will undergo an operation to replace a tube and continue using Atrovent and Albuterol as needed. Prednisone dosage will be adjusted and tapered over two weeks. The patient has acute kidney injury, with an improvement in creatinine levels. He is also being managed for peripheral vascular disease and Parkinson's disease. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are potential medical complications that can arise, such as worsening respiratory distress, infection, and kidney dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemi diaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia with a stent placed. He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. The patient has had a tube fall-out, which required a return to the operating room for replacement. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia, suspect Healthcare Associated: The patient will continue on broad-spectrum antibiotics pending sensitivities. Vancomycin will be discontinued as no gram+ organism is growing. Levofloxacin will be used for atypical organisms. The patient is going back to the operating room for tracheostomy tube replacement. Standing Atrovent and prn Albuterol will be continued. Prednisone dosage will be changed to 40mg daily for a component of COPD and tapered over two weeks.
2. Acute on CKD: The patient's baseline SCr was approximately 1.0, but it has improved to 1.4.
3. PVD: The patient is currently on Coumadin/ASA. Coumadin will be held per vascular surgeon's communication in case of bronchial bleeding and can be restarted after procedures. ASA 325mg will be continued.
4. Parkinson's Disease: Sinemet will be continued, and confirmation of adding Parkinson's medications with rehab is planned for"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of right hemidiaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, tracheal malacia, pulmonary fibrosis (although not evident on CT scan), Parkinson's disease, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression/anxiety. He is currently in the ICU due to low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray, suspected to be healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on various medications including antibiotics, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and antihypertensives.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray suggest pneumonia. Since it is suspected to be healthcare-associated, broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
2. Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's baseline serum creatinine (SCr) level of 1.0 has increased to 1.5 and then returned to 1.2. Close monitoring of kidney function is necessary, and euvolemia should be maintained.
3. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient is on Coumadin/ASA for PVD and will hold Coumadin per vascular surgeon's recommendation in case of bronchial procedures. ASA 325mg and warfarin will be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemidiaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia. He is currently admitted to the ICU and is being treated for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease (CKD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), Parkinson's disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood glucose levels have been well controlled. The patient is receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia, steroids for COPD, anticoagulants for PVD, Parkinson's medication, antihypertensives, and statins for hyperlipidemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening pneumonia: The patient is already suspected to have healthcare-associated pneumonia. If not properly managed, there is a risk of the infection progressing and potentially leading to sepsis or respiratory failure.

2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level was around 1.0, but it increased to 1.5 and then decreased back to 1.2. This fluctuation suggests the possibility of acute kidney injury, which could be related to factors such as dehydration, medication side effects, or underlying kidney disease.

3. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemidiaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia. He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray. The assessment suggests pneumonia, possibly healthcare-associated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated empirically. The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI) with baseline serum creatinine (SCr) of ~1.0, now back to 1.0 from 1.5. Other medical conditions include peripheral vascular disease (PVD), Parkinson's disease, hypertension (HTN), depression/anxiety, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is tolerating a regular diet, with supervised meals recommended due to the risk of aspiration. Blood sugar levels are well-controlled. The patient requires a PICC line and is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Code status is full code, and the patient is being called out to the medical floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Given his hospital stay, there is a risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia, which requires prompt identification and appropriate antibiotic treatment.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's SC"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right hemidiaphragm paralysis, COPD, bronchiectasis, and tracheal malacia. He presents with low-grade fevers, increased cough, and focal findings on x-ray, suggesting pneumonia, possibly healthcare-associated. Antibiotics have been narrowed to cover Gram-negative rods (GNR) and atypical organisms. The patient is also on prednisone for COPD, and his SCr level has improved from 1.5 to 1.2. He has multiple comorbidities including CKD, PVD, Parkinson's disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He is on various medications such as Coumadin/ASA, Sinemet, diltiazem, lisinopril, duloxetine, and statins. The patient is currently in the ICU with the following assessments and plans:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, most likely healthcare-associated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, targeting GNR and atypical organisms. Vancomycin has been stopped due to negative sputum culture results for Gram-positive cocci.

2. Right Hemidiaphragm Paralysis: The patient has a pre-existing condition of right hemidiaphragm paralysis. No specific interventions mentioned for this condition.

3. Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient presented with an acute rise in SCr from 1.0 to"

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of tuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU with a new pneumonia and placed on a t-piece after suctioning. The patient has shown improvement with antibiotics and COPD treatment.

During the ICU stay, the patient underwent a bronchoscopy and had a PICC line inserted. He received various medications including opioids, benzodiazepines, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/78 mmHg to 137/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's review of systems showed no constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or weight loss. He also did not have any respiratory symptoms like cough or shortness of breath. His fluid balance was monitored, and his urine output was within normal range.

Physical examination revealed a well-nourished patient without acute distress. His cardiovascular examination was unremarkable, and his respiratory examination showed mild expiratory wheezes. His abdomen was soft and non-tender, and his extremities were warm and well-perfused. Neurological examination showed that the patient was attentive, followed simple commands, and responded appropriately.

Laboratory results indicated leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of tuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU for healthcare-associated pneumonia and a likely aspiration event. The patient has shown improvement with antibiotic treatment and COPD management.

24-hour events include bronchoscopies, insertion of a percutaneous catheter (PICC) line, and reinsertion of a cannula. The patient feels much better this morning with no new events overnight.

The patient has allergies to opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, confusion/delirium, sulfa (sulfonamides), and tetanus. He has received antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and meropenem. Other medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, mycon powder, prednisone, cinemet, meropenem, fa, lido patch (delayed), trifluor eye, docusate, atrovent q6, and vanco 1q24.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and sore throat. Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's temperature is within normal range, and there is no mention of fever.

Physical examination reveals wheezes in the respiratory system and warm skin"
