   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo M with DM who presents with fever/MS change found to have LP
   consistent with bac. meningitis and mastoiditis.
   .
   # Meningitis: Likely bacerial given purulent LP and GPCs on G stain.
   Likely strep pneumo. Other et. include N. meningidities, lysteria.
   Less likely viral at this time.  Patient with a source for meningitis -
   mastoiditis, making lysteria less likely.  Holding acyclovir at this
   time given low prob of viral infection.  One thing interesting on the
   CSF report was a mention fr intracellular orgamisms.  Patient was in ME
   and is at risk for intracellular orgamisms such as rickettsial
   diseases.  However that would be more likely to present as an aseptic
   meningitis as opposed to an acute bacterial meningitis.  Also, his ear
   cultures are growing GNR and GPR
   - get OSH speciation tomorrow
   -Vancomycin 1g q12; Ceftriaxone 2g q12; Bactrim 500mg q6 - to cover
   listeria given pen allergy
   - Will treat for mastoiditis time course, need to look up time course
   for this.
   -Dexamethasone 6mg IV q8
   -Droplet precautions until N.mening ruled out.
   .
   # Respiratory failure/Sepsis: At this time, strongly suspect source is
   acute mastoiditis --> Meningitis.  Have been called by OSH with 2 sets
   positive blood Cx - both GPC.  Patient without evidence of pneumonia,
   Patient intubated given tachypnea and concern for wearing out.  Likely
   tachypnic given underlying sepsis.
   -Mechanical ventilation for now.
   -Supportive care - Head of bed elevation, OG tube, mouth care.
   - SBT today and consider extubation this afternoon
   -Abx per above.
   .
   # Mastoiditis: History consistent with acute mastoiditis.  Given the
   fact that he is diabetic raises the concern for polymicrobial infection
   as well as pseudamonas.  However given the fact that he has GPC in CSF
   andf blood, it is likely that is the causative orgamism.  Ceftriaxone
   is decent for coverage of mastoiditis although does lack pseudamonas
   coverage.  Will defer ABX changes to ENT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension. He presented with fever and meningitis, which was found to be bacterial in nature. The likely causative organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient also has mastoiditis, and cultures are growing Gram-positive rods (GPC) and Gram-negative rods (GNR). He is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and sepsis. The source of the infection is suspected to be acute mastoiditis. The patient has been started on antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and dexamethasone. He is also receiving mechanical ventilation and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already septic, and if not properly managed, there is a risk of worsening sepsis and potential septic shock.
3. Meningitis complications: Bacterial meningitis can lead to neurological complications such as brain abscesses or hydrocephalus if not adequately treated.
4. Mastoiditis complications: Acute mastoiditis can lead to complications such as hearing loss, facial nerve paralysis, or intracranial spread of infection.
5. Diabetes complications: Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic crises."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension who presented with fever and meningitis. The patient was found to have purulent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and gram-positive cocci (GPC) on Gram stain, which suggests bacterial meningitis. The most likely causative organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other possible etiologies include Neisseria meningitidis and Listeria monocytogenes. However, Listeria is less likely due to the patient's mastoiditis, which can serve as a source for bacterial infection. The patient is also at risk for intracellular organisms such as Rickettsia, but this would typically present as aseptic meningitis rather than bacterial meningitis.

The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and sepsis, with suspected mastoiditis as the source. He has positive blood cultures growing GPC, indicating a bacterial infection. There is no evidence of pneumonia, and the patient is intubated due to tachypnea and concern for respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation is being provided, along with supportive care such as head of bed elevation, oral gastric tube, and mouth care.

The patient's diabetes is not well controlled, and insulin gtt will be started while the patient is intubated. Oral medications will be resumed once the patient is no longer intubated. The patient's hypertension is currently not hypertensive, and medications are"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo M with DM who presents with fever/MS change found to have LP
   consistent with bac. meningitis and mastoiditis.
   .
   # Meningitis: Likely bacerial given purulent LP and GPCs on G stain.
   Likely strep pneumo. Other et. include N. meningidities, lysteria.
   Less likely viral at this time.  Patient with a source for meningitis -
   mastoiditis, making lysteria less likely.  Holding acyclovir at this
   time given low prob of viral infection.  One thing interesting on the
   CSF report was a mention fr intracellular orgamisms.  Patient was in ME
   and is at risk for intracellular orgamisms such as rickettsial
   diseases.  However that would be more likely to present as an aseptic
   meningitis as opposed to an acute bacterial meningitis.
   -Vancomycin 1g q12
   -Ceftriaxone 2g q12
   -Bactrim 500mg q6 - to cover listeria given pen allergy
   -Dexamethasone 6mg IV q8
   -Droplet precautions until N.mening ruled out.
   .
   # Respiratory failure/Sepsis: At this time, strongly suspect source is
   acute mastoiditis --> Meningitis.  Have been called by OSH with 2 sets
   positive blood Cx - both GPC.  Patient without evidence of pneumonia,
   Patient intubated given tachypnea and concern for wearing out.  Likely
   tachypnic given underlying sepsis.
   -Mechanical ventilation for now.
   -Supportive care - Head of bed elevation, OG tube, mouth care.
   -CVL
   -A-line
   -Abx per above.
   .
   # Mastoiditis: History consistent with acute mastoiditis.  Given the
   fact that he is diabetic raises the concern for polymicrobial infection
   as well as pseudamonas.  However given the fact that he has GPC in CSF
   andf blood, it is likely that is the causative orgamism.  Ceftriaxone
   is decent for coverage of mastoiditis although does lack pseudamonas
   coverage.  Will defer ABX changes to ENT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with fever and meningitis symptoms. He was found to have purulent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) consistent with bacterial meningitis, likely caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient also has mastoiditis, which is a potential source of the infection. He has been placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's diabetes is not well controlled, and he is currently on insulin gtt while intubated. His hypertension and gout medications are being held.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is not addressed, there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, including fever, tachypnea, and positive blood cultures. Without appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care, the sepsis may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.

3. Meningitis Complications: Bacterial meningitis can lead to various complications such as brain abscesses, hearing loss, seizures, and neurological deficits. These complications need to be monitored and managed accordingly.

4. Mastoiditis Complications: Acute mastoiditis can lead to complications such as spread of infection to the middle ear, facial nerve palsy, or even intrac"

   NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: In addition to the chronic findings,
   there are
   fluid levels in both maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, and scattered

   air cells of the left mastoid process. Opacification of the right
   middle ear
   cavity, with fluid in the right external auditory canal.
   2. Several foci of possible dehiscence involving the right tegmen
   tympani could reflect adjacent soft tissue, chronic resorption with
   demineralization or frank destruction.
   2. Fluid levels and mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses, with
   mucus-retention cysts in the maxillary sinuses.

   # Meningitis: Likely bacerial given purulent LP and GPCs on G stain.
   Likely strep pneumo. Other et. include N. meningidities, lysteria.
   Less likely viral at this time.  Patient with a source for meningitis -
   mastoiditis, making lysteria less likely.  Holding acyclovir at this
   time given low prob of viral infection.  One thing interesting on the
   CSF report was a mention fr intracellular orgamisms.  Patient was in ME
   and is at risk for intracellular orgamisms such as rickettsial
   diseases.  However that would be more likely to present as an aseptic
   meningitis as opposed to an acute bacterial meningitis.  Also, his ear
   cultures are growing GNR and GPR
   - get OSH speciation tomorrow
   -Vancomycin 1g q12; Ceftriaxone 2g q12; Bactrim 500mg q6 - to cover

   for this.
   -Dexamethasone 6mg IV q8
   -Droplet precautions until N.mening ruled out.

   acute mastoiditis --> Meningitis.  Have been called by OSH with 2 sets
   positive blood Cx - both GPC.  Patient without evidence of pneumonia,
   Patient intubated given tachypnea and concern for wearing out.  Likely
   tachypnic given underlying sepsis.

   -Supportive care - Head of bed elevation, OG tube, mouth care.
   - SBT today and consider extubation this afternoon
   -Abx per above.

   # Mastoiditis: History consistent with acute mastoiditis.  Given the
   fact that he is diabetic raises the concern for polymicrobial infection
   as well as pseudamonas.  However given the fact that he has GPC in CSF
   andf blood, it is likely that is the causative orgamism.  Ceftriaxone
   is decent for coverage of mastoiditis although does lack pseudamonas

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who presents with fever and mental status changes. The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis and mastoiditis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not effectively treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that can occur when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Given the patient's poorly controlled diabetes, there is a risk of DKA developing, especially if the patient is not receiving appropriate insulin therapy.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and there is a possibility of it worsening if not managed properly.
5. Gout: The patient has a history of gout, and the use of certain medications may exacerbate this condition.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Due to the patient being bedridden and on anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of developing DVT and subsequently PE.
7. Nosocomial infection: Being in the ICU, the patient is at risk of acquiring a nosocomial infection, especially"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo M with DM who presents with fever/MS change found to have LP
   consistent with bac. meningitis and mastoiditis.
   .
   # Meningitis: Likely bacerial given purulent LP and GPCs on G stain.
   Likely strep pneumo. Other et. include N. meningidities, lysteria.
   Less likely viral at this time.  Patient with a source for meningitis -
   mastoiditis, making lysteria less likely.  Holding acyclovir at this
   time given low prob of viral infection.  One thing interesting on the
   CSF report was a mention fr intracellular orgamisms.  Patient was in ME
   and is at risk for intracellular orgamisms such as rickettsial
   diseases.  However that would be more likely to present as an aseptic
   meningitis as opposed to an acute bacterial meningitis.  Also, his ear
   cultures are growing GNR and GPR
   - get OSH sensitivities
   -Vancomycin 1g q12; Ceftriaxone 2g q12, continue; check vanco trough
   - d/c bactrim (as strep pneumo, not listeria as the bacteria)
   - Will treat for mastoiditis time course, need to look up time course
   for this.
   -Dexamethasone stopped
   .
   # Respiratory failure/Sepsis: At this time, strongly suspect source is
   acute mastoiditis --> Meningitis.  Have been called by OSH with 2 sets
   positive blood Cx - both GPC.  Patient without evidence of pneumonia,
   Patient intubated given tachypnea and concern for wearing out.  Likely
   tachypnic given underlying sepsis.  Resolved
 extubated and breathing
   comfortably.
   -Abx per above.
   .
   # Mastoiditis: History consistent with acute mastoiditis.  Given the
   fact that he is diabetic raises the concern for polymicrobial infection
   as well as pseudamonas.  However given the fact that he has GPC in CSF
   andf blood, it is likely that is the causative orgamism.  Ceftriaxone
   is decent for coverage of mastoiditis although does lack pseudamonas
   coverage.  Will defer ABX changes to ENT.
   -f/u ENT recs
   - clinically improving, so hold on further imaging
   -cont ABX.
   -If does not improve consider involving ID (hold on this).
   .
   # Diabetes: Currently not well controlled.  Was on insulin gtt while
   intubated.  Resumed oral meds now that not intubated.
   - increase glargine
   - increase ISS (particularly while on steroids)
   - peripheral neuropathy pain; start neurontin; use oxycodone prn until
   the neurontin
s therapy becomes effective
   .
   # HTN: Currently not hypertensive, holding meds.
   .
   # Agitation/aggression; start ativan prn; discontinue haldol; fall risk
   precautions
   .
   # Gout: Holding meds.
   .

   adjusted, Wills start TF after nutrition consult and NGT adjusted

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with fever and mental status changes. He was found to have lumbar puncture (LP) consistent with bacterial meningitis and mastoiditis.

The assessment and plan for the patient include:

1. Meningitis: The patient likely has bacterial meningitis, most likely caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other possible causes include Neisseria meningitidis and Listeria monocytogenes. However, Listeria is less likely due to the presence of mastoiditis as a source of infection. Acyclovir is being held due to low probability of viral infection. The patient's ear cultures are growing Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Gram-positive rods (GPR), so sensitivities should be obtained, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone should be continued. Bactrim should be discontinued.

2. Respiratory failure/Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and sepsis are suspected to be caused by acute mastoiditis leading to meningitis. Blood cultures have shown two positive results for Gram-positive cocci (GPC). The patient does not have evidence of pneumonia, but he was intubated due to tachypnea and concern for respiratory failure. He has now been extubated and is breathing comfortably. Antibiotics should be given as mentioned above.

3. Mastoiditis: The patient has a history consistent"

   # Mastoiditis: History consistent with acute mastoiditis.  Given the
   fact that he is diabetic raises the concern for polymicrobial infection
   as well as pseudamonas.  However given the fact that he has GPC in CSF
   andf blood, it is likely that is the causative orgamism.  Ceftriaxone
   is decent for coverage of mastoiditis although does lack pseudamonas
   coverage.  Will defer ABX changes to ENT.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with fever and meningismus, leading to the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis and mastoiditis.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function.
- Imaging reveals widening of the upper mediastinum, possibly due to increased caliber of the mediastinal veins.
- The patient's respiratory support has been managed, and he is currently not intubated but previously required mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's medications include vancomycin, ceftriaxone, dexamethasone, gabapentin, and zyprexa.
- The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, agitation, and gout.
- The patient's electrolytes are replete, and he requires adjustment of his nasogastric tube and total parenteral nutrition (TF).
- Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if his condition worsens.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection with positive blood cultures, indicating a potential risk of sepsis.
3. Diabetic complications: The patient"

   as well as pseudamonas.  However given the fact that he has GPC in CSF
   andf blood, it is likely that is the causative orgamism.  Ceftriaxone
   is decent for coverage of mastoiditis although does lack pseudamonas
   coverage.  Will defer ABX changes to ENT.
   -f/u ENT recs
   - clinically improving, so hold on further imaging
   -cont ABX.
   -If does not improve consider involving ID (hold on this).

   # Diabetes: Currently not well controlled.  Was on insulin gtt while
   intubated.  Resumed oral meds now that not intubated.
   - increase glargine
   - increase ISS (particularly while on steroids)
   - peripheral neuropathy pain; start neurontin; use oxycodone prn until
   the neurontin
s therapy becomes effective
   .
   # HTN: Currently not hypertensive, holding meds.
   .
   # Agitation/aggression; start ativan prn; discontinue haldol; fall risk
   precautions
   .
   # Gout: Holding meds.

   FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, OG tube too high, will need to be
   adjusted, Wills start TF after nutrition consult and NGT adjusted

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with diabetes mellitus who presented with fever and meningismus, and was found to have acute bacterial meningitis and mastoiditis. He also has a history of respiratory failure and sepsis, which is suspected to be secondary to acute mastoiditis. The patient's diabetes is not well controlled, and he has peripheral neuropathy pain. He is also hypertensive, but currently not hypertensive, and his agitation and aggression are being managed with lorazepam. Additionally, the patient has a history of gout, but his medications for it are being held. The patient has received multiple antibiotics for his condition, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Bactrim. He has been intubated and extubated multiple times, and his vital signs are currently stable. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with slightly decreased hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume. His blood glucose level is elevated. Imaging studies reveal widening of the upper mediastinum, likely due to increased caliber of the mediastinal veins. There are no appreciable pleural effusions or mediastinal adenopathy. The patient's respiratory cultures grew Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci. The assessment and plan include treating the patient's meningitis with ceftriaxone and vancomycin, addressing his mastoiditis, diabetes, hypertension, agitation, and g"
