   Chief Complaint: cardiogenic shock
   24 Hour Events:
   - renal came by thought that needed CVVH for fluid removal, had femoral
   line placed to for dialysis
   - respiratory status clinically worsening with respiration to 40s
   - urine lytes Urine urea 169, urine creatinine 132, na < assay, urine
   osm 340, FeNa < 1%
   - urine eos were negative
   - urine lytes: feurea 7% all suggestive of pre-renal etiology likely in
   the setting of poor forward flow with cardiogenic
   - patient intubated in the setting of continued tachycardia  and
   worsening respiratory distress: started neosynephrine prophylactically
   prior to intubation to prevent from dropping pressure
   - started on fentayl and versed for sedation
   - patient got succinylcholine, etomidate as well as 2 x 1mg bolus of
   neo during intubation
   - post intubation chest x-ray demonstrates - ett terminate at thoracic
   inlet 4.5cm from carina, ogt in stomach. other lines stable. slightly

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM,
   hyperlipidemia and recent fall who presents with nausea and vomiting
   and ongoing CP, found to have elevated CE and EKG changes without any
   acute infarct seen on cardiac catherization.
   .
   # Shock: Presented with hypotension, low CI and extremely elevated
   filling pressures, all consistent with cardiogenic shock.  Also cool
   and clamped down on exam.  Etiology possibly hypotension (unclear
   precipitant) leading to global ischemia and poor CO and elevated
   filling pressures. Patient had balloon pump placed during cardiac
   catherization.
   - Cont. balloon pump, 1:1 with goal MAP>60
   - levofed to maintain blood pressure control for now
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.
   - cont. ASA, statin, hep drip
   - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ARF: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On arrival patient with
   Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6. No known h/o renal disease.  FeNa 7% and
   feNa < 1% on urine lytes. Etiology includes hypotension, poor forward
   flow in setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock.  Also received
   contrast at OSH, however suspsect that this effect is too early.
   Patient did not put out to lasix drip at maximum doses or Diorel.
   Renal was consulted and recommended starting CVVH in order to remove
   fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Currently appears euvolemic.
   Remains hypoxic, however likely related to splinting in setting of L
   rib fx.
   - Monitor I/O with goal -1 liter per day with CVVH
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure
   - repeat TTE
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele
   .
   # Hypotension: BP ranging in 90s-100s here.  Extremities are cool,
   concerning for cardiogenic shock.  Has evidence of end-organ damage
   with ARF and urine output dropped off despite lasix drip.  Patient had
   intraaortic balloon pump placed in the cath lab.
   - pressors as required to maintain MAP > 60
   - Holding BB for now
   .
   # DM: On 3 oral medications at home.  Received contrast at OSH so
   holding metformin.  In setting of acute illness will hold all oral
   meds.
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].  On
   procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   - Cont to follow [**Hospital1 **]
   - guaiac stools
   - Transfuse <25
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - cont atorvastatin
   .
   # Peripheral neuropathy: On gabapentin as outpatient.
   - Restart once stable

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. The patient presented with nausea and vomiting and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes (CE) and EKG changes without any acute infarct seen on cardiac catheterization.

The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, characterized by hypotension, low cardiac index (CI), and extremely elevated filling pressures. He has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and likely ischemic heart disease, as evidenced by the presence of three-vessel disease (3VD) on catheterization. The patient's left ventricular (LV) function is significantly depressed, and he has global hypokinesis.

The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels from 1.9 at OSH to 3.6 on admission. The patient has a history of anemia, likely due to chronic disease, and is at risk for rebleeding given his recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

The patient's blood pressure is ranging in the 90s-100s, and extremities are cool, which is concerning for cardiogenic shock. He has evidence of end-organ damage with acute renal failure (ARF) and decreased urine output despite lasix drip. The patient had an intraaortic balloon"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presents with nausea and vomiting and is diagnosed with cardiogenic shock. The patient has been treated with a balloon pump, intra-aortic balloon pump placement, and various medications. He also has acute renal failure, liver abnormalities, and hypotension. The patient's current condition is critical, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's primary condition is cardiogenic shock, which can lead to poor tissue perfusion, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not managed properly.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and low urine output, indicating renal dysfunction. ARF can progress to chronic renal failure if not treated promptly.
3. Liver abnormalities: The patient has significantly elevated liver enzymes, which may be secondary to cardiogenic shock or other factors. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further liver damage.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains in the 90s-100s, indicating persistent hypotension. This can compromise tissue perfusion and increase the risk of end-organ damage.
5. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization, invasive lines, and immunosuppression can increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections such"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM,
   hyperlipidemia and recent fall who presents with nausea and vomiting
   and ongoing CP, found to have elevated CE and EKG changes without
   multivessel disease on cardiac catherization.
   .
   # SHOCK: Presented with hypotension, low CI and extremely elevated
   filling pressures, all consistent with cardiogenic shock.  Also cool
   and clamped down on exam.  Etiology possibly hypotension (unclear
   precipitant) leading to global ischemia and poor CO and elevated
   filling pressures. Patient had balloon pump placed during cardiac
   catherization to augment coronary perfusion.  With balloon pump off
   today SBP maintained in 100s.
   - Cont. balloon pump, 1:1 with goal MAP>60
   - levofed to maintain MAP>60
   - Wean levo as tolerated
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.
   - cont. ASA, statin, hep drip
   - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ARF: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On arrival patient with
   Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6. No known h/o renal disease.  feNa < 1% on
   urine lytes. Etiology includes hypotension, poor forward flow in
   setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock.  Also received contrast at
   OSH, however suspect that this effect is too early. Patient did not put
   out to lasix drip at maximum doses or Diorel.  Renal was consulted and
   started CVVH in order to remove fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Had significant pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation.   Has PA catheter to monitor hemodynamics.
   - Monitor I/O with goal -1 liter per day with CVVH.
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure
   - repeat TTE in am
   - Daily CXR to assess PA cath and balloon location
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele
   .
   # Acute liver abnormalities
 patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect
   secondary to cardiogenic shock.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue pressors to maintain adequate MAP
   -avoid Tylenol
   - consider viral hepatitis serologies although low probability as
   previously normal
   .
   # DM: On 3 oral medications at home.  Received contrast at OSH so
   holding metformin.  In setting of acute illness will hold all oral
   meds.
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].  On
   procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   - Cont to follow [**Hospital1 **]
   - guaiac stools
   - Transfuse <25
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - cont atorvastatin
   .
   # Peripheral neuropathy: On gabapentin as outpatient.
   - Restart once stable

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Several major issues:
   1. Cardiogenic shock. On IABP with stable MAP and cardiac index.
   2. Acute renal failure. On CRRT. Follow acid base ad electrolytes
   3. Pulmonary edema: PAD decreasing; Oxygenation adequate on ventilator.
   Overall stable course on maximum support. Limiting factors will be
   renal recovery and cardiac compensation. Will need repeat echo to
   evaluate AS.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health
   care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 45 minutes of critical care time.

   on:[**2190-2-8**] 14:15 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain (CP). The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, likely due to hypotension and poor coronary perfusion. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.2°C, heart rate (HR) of 102 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 106/55 to 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) ranging from 16 to 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 98%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of CAD, with three-vessel disease demonstrated on cardiac catheterization. The patient also had a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which was treated medically. Laboratory results show elevated cardiac biomarkers, consistent with myocardial injury.

The patient has been placed on a balloon pump to augment coronary perfusion. The plan includes continuing the balloon pump, maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg with vasopressors, and weaning the vasopressors as tolerated. The patient is also on aspirin, statin therapy, and has had a stat bedside echocardiogram showing significantly depressed left vent"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient presented with nausea and vomiting and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes (CE) and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute hepatitis, acute renal failure (ARF), and anemia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. He is also on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) for renal support.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 102.8°F (39.3°C) initially, currently 101.8°F (38.8°C)
- Heart rate: 89 bpm
- Blood pressure: 88/53 mmHg (69/40 mmHg at times)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99% on FiO2 of 50%

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, liver enzymes, and troponin T. The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL.

The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, including PIV lines, L femoral HD line, R femoral PA catheter, and an IABP line. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), lansoprazole, midazolam, and others.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently in the CCU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral neuropathy. He presented with nausea and vomiting and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, sepsis, respiratory distress, acute hepatitis, acute renal failure, and anemia. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently critically ill in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low cardiac output and elevated filling pressures indicate cardiogenic shock. This condition can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia and signs of systemic inflammation, indicating sepsis. Sepsis can progress to septic shock, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential death.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. This condition can worsen if not treated promptly, leading to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to pulmonary edema and rib fractures. Extubation will depend on the resolution of respiratory distress and adequate volume status.
5. Acute Hepatitis: The patient has significantly elevated liver enzymes, indicating acute hepatitis."

   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization.
   .
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:
   - Shock picture now is a combination of cardiogenic with
   distributative.
   - Cont. balloon pump, 1:1 with goal MAP>60 and goal CI 2.0, if
   possible, will try to wean down to 2:1 though his MAPS this
     morning are only in the low 60s.
   - Switched levofed to vasopressin [**1-25**] recurrent ventricular ectopy with
   a non-perfusing NSVT, consider adding levophed back if
      needed
   - Cardiogenic shock is complicated by septic shock
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Pt with GPC bacteremia as of [**2190-2-8**]. Once off
   levophed PVR < WNL consistent with a distributive shock. Given ongoing
   bacteremia there is likely a component of septic shock.
   - Continue screening BCx until cleared
   - Empiric vanco + pip/tazo dosed for CVVH
   - Investigate sources for infection. Has thrombophlebitis on R hand. ?
   Aspiration PNA. Lines are new but may be source of infection. Will try
   and get PA line out.
   - Tylenol PRN for now to control temp and reduce drive for tachycardia
   and ectopy
   .
   # VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA:
   Ongoing Respiratory distress: Pt with rib fractures from fall +
   pulmonary edema from acute systolic CHF. Intubated [**1-25**] respiratory
   distress and tiring from effort. Now with left sided infiltrate and
   sputum with GNR, GPC, and GN Dip
   - Continue intubation for now
   - Continue to pull off fluid with CVVH
   - Extubate as soon as possible once volume status controlled.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis
 patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary
   to cardiogenic shock.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - continue pressors to maintain adequate MAP
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   ..
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On
   arrival patient with Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6. No known h/o renal
   disease.  feNa < 1% on urine lytes. Etiology includes hypotension, poor
   forward flow in setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock.  Renal was
   consulted and started CVVH in order to remove fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.
   - cont. ASA, statin, hep drip
   - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Had significant pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation.   Has PA catheter to monitor hemodynamics.
   - Monitor I/O with goal -100mL/hr with CVVH.
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure
   - repeat TTE pending to assess cardiac function (planned for today)
   - Daily CXR to assess PA cath and balloon location
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.
   .
   # DM: On 3 oral medications at home.  Received contrast at OSH so
   holding metformin.  In setting of acute illness will hold all oral
   meds.
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   - Cont to follow [**Hospital1 **]
   - guaiac stools
   - Transfuse this morning (<25)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - cont atorvastatin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications and conditions include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent myocardial infarction (MI), which likely contributed to the development of cardiogenic shock. The patient's low blood pressure, decreased cardiac output, and elevated biomarkers indicate ongoing cardiac dysfunction.

2. Septic shock: The patient developed septic shock, likely due to bacteremia caused by GPC. This is supported by the presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and organ dysfunction.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed left-sided infiltrates and sputum with GNR, GPC, and GN Dip, indicating the possibility of VAP. Intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing pneumonia.

4. Acute hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are significantly elevated, suggesting acute hepatitis. This could be secondary to cardiogenic shock or another underlying cause.

5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.9, which increased to 3.6 on arrival. With no known history of renal disease, the etiology of AKI is likely due to hypotension and poor forward flow in the setting of heart failure and cardiogenic shock. CVVH has been initiated to remove excess fluid and support renal function.

6. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, including a recent NSTEMI and 3-vessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient's elevated cardiac biomarkers suggest ongoing myocardial injury.

7. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient's bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV hypokinesis, indicating dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic in nature.

8. Pulmonary edema: The patient required intubation due to significant pulmonary edema from acute systolic CHF.

9. Thrombophlebitis: The patient has thrombophlebitis on the right hand, which could be a source of infection.

10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and was on Vytorin at home. In the setting of NSTEMI, atorvastatin 80mg has been started.

11. Peripheral neuropathy: The patient has a history of peripheral neuropathy and was on gabapentin as an outpatient.

12. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely chronic disease-related, with low iron levels and elevated ferritin.

13. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia.

14. Falls: The patient has a recent history of falls, which could have contributed to their current condition.

It is important to note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   - Shock picture now is a combination of cardiogenic with
   distributative.
   - Cont. balloon pump, 1:1 with goal MAP>60 and goal CI 2.0, if
   possible, will try to wean down to 2:1 though his MAPS this
     morning are only in the low 60s.
   - Switched levofed to vasopressin [**1-25**] recurrent ventricular ectopy with
   a non-perfusing NSVT, consider adding levophed back if
      needed
   - Cardiogenic shock is complicated by septic shock
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Pt with GPC bacteremia as of [**2190-2-8**]. Once off

   # Acute Kidney Injury: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On
   arrival patient with Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6. No known h/o renal
   disease.  feNa < 1% on urine lytes. Etiology includes hypotension, poor
   forward flow in setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock.  Renal was
   consulted and started CVVH in order to remove fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.

   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Had significant pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation.   Has PA catheter to monitor hemodynamics.
   - Monitor I/O with goal -100mL/hr with CVVH.
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure
   - repeat TTE pending to assess cardiac function (planned for today)
   - Daily CXR to assess PA cath and balloon location

   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.

   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, recent myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a fall. He presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing cardiogenic shock. The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. 

Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's shock picture is a combination of cardiogenic with distributive. He is on a balloon pump, 1:1 with goal MAP >60 and goal CI 2.0, and may attempt to wean down to 2:1. Levofed was switched to vasopressin due to recurrent ventricular ectopy with non-perfusing NSVT.

2. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has GPC bacteremia. There is ongoing bacteremia, likely contributing to septic shock. Empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam are being dosed for CVVH. Sources of infection need to be investigated, including thrombophlebitis on the right hand and possible aspiration pneumonia. A PA line needs to be removed.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has left-sided infiltrate and sputum with GNR, GPC, and GN dip. He will continue to be intubated and fluid will be pulled"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea and vomiting and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient experienced cardiogenic shock, which was treated with a balloon pump to augment coronary perfusion. He also developed septic shock due to a GPC bacteremia and required empiric antibiotics. The patient had respiratory distress, possibly due to rib fractures from a fall and pulmonary edema from acute systolic congestive heart failure, leading to intubation. He also had acute hepatitis with significantly elevated liver function tests, acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level, and a history of chronic kidney disease. The patient's coronary arteries were found to have three-vessel disease during the cardiac catheterization. He has been receiving various medications and treatments, including cardiac enzymes, statins, heparin, and aspirin. The patient's current condition is complicated by multiple medical complications, including cardiogenic shock, septic shock, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation was cardiogenic shock, which is a serious condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can lead to organ damage"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient is currently in the ICU for cardiogenic shock, sepsis/bacteremia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, and coronary artery disease. He has multiple medical complications including hypotension, poor forward flow in the setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock, sepsis, respiratory distress, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and poor cardiac output indicate cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Sepsis can progress rapidly and may lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed left-sided infiltrates and sputum with Gram-negative rods, Gram-positive cocci, and diplococci. VAP can increase the risk of mortality and should be treated promptly with appropriate antibiotics.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization.
   .
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:
   - Shock picture now is a combination of cardiogenic with
   distributative.
   - Cont. balloon pump, 1:1 with goal MAP>60 and goal CI 2.0, if
   possible, will try to wean down to 2:1 though his MAPS this
     morning are only in the low 60s.
   - Switched levofed to vasopressin [**1-25**] recurrent ventricular ectopy with
   a non-perfusing NSVT, consider adding levophed back if
      needed
   - Cardiogenic shock is complicated by septic shock
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Pt with GPC bacteremia as of [**2190-2-8**]. Once off
   levophed PVR < WNL consistent with a distributive shock. Given ongoing
   bacteremia there is likely a component of septic shock.
   - Continue screening BCx until cleared
   - Empiric vanco + pip/tazo dosed for CVVH
   - Investigate sources for infection. Has thrombophlebitis on R hand. ?
   Aspiration PNA. Lines are new but may be source of infection. Will try
   and get PA line out.
   - Tylenol PRN for now to control temp and reduce drive for tachycardia
   and ectopy
   .
   # VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA:
   Ongoing Respiratory distress: Pt with rib fractures from fall +
   pulmonary edema from acute systolic CHF. Intubated [**1-25**] respiratory
   distress and tiring from effort. Now with left sided infiltrate and
   sputum with GNR, GPC, and GN Dip
   - Continue intubation for now
   - Continue to pull off fluid with CVVH
   - Extubate as soon as possible once volume status controlled.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis
 patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary
   to cardiogenic shock.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - continue pressors to maintain adequate MAP
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   ..
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On
   arrival patient with Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6. No known h/o renal
   disease.  feNa < 1% on urine lytes. Etiology includes hypotension, poor
   forward flow in setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock.  Renal was
   consulted and started CVVH in order to remove fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.
   - cont. ASA, statin, hep drip
   - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Had significant pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation.   Has PA catheter to monitor hemodynamics.
   - Monitor I/O with goal -100mL/hr with CVVH.
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure
   - repeat TTE pending to assess cardiac function (planned for today)
   - Daily CXR to assess PA cath and balloon location
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.
   .
   # DM: On 3 oral medications at home.  Received contrast at OSH so
   holding metformin.  In setting of acute illness will hold all oral
   meds.
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   - Cont to follow [**Hospital1 **]
   - guaiac stools
   - Transfuse this morning (<25)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - cont atorvastatin
   .
   # Peripheral neuropathy: On gabapentin as outpatient.
   - Restart once stable

   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs: switch from Zosyn to Levofloxacin for better coverage of
   Moraxella Catarrhalis in sputum, continue Vanc, add Gentamycin for
   synergistic effect in case endocarditis. Also daily BCx x2, TEE to r/o
   endocarditis when able (not ordered yet)
   - RIJ placed. During this pt had small run of V-tach with rate 110s,
   improved after carotid massage to 70s. Likely related to guidewire
   removal.
   - Renal replaced L femoral CVVH line with L IJ. Line was short, so will
   be exchanged today.
   - R femoral Swann-Ganz and sheath removed, as well as L femoral CVVH
   line
   - Heparin resumed while on 1:2
   - Low-dose Dopamine had been added to Vasopressin for BP support.
   Planned to wean off IABP then pressors, but overnight at 3:45a had a
   ~20min run of V-tach with HR in 60s, MAPS down to 60s, lytes were wnl.
   Pt was sleeping at the time. IABP was switched back to 1:1 for
   improvement of MAPS. Responded to carotid massage with return of sinus
   rhythm, HR back down to 70s, MAPS up to 70s-80s.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea and vomiting and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock with a combination of cardiogenic and distributive components. He is being treated with a balloon pump and vasopressin, and his goal MAP is greater than 60 and CI of 2.0. There is also a concern for septic shock due to ongoing bacteremia, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and previous ejection fraction of 25%. He had a significant pulmonary edema requiring intubation and now has a PA catheter to monitor hemodynamics. His renal function is impaired with a baseline creatinine of 1.9, which has increased to 3.6. The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to acute kidney injury. There are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient's sputum culture shows growth of GNR, GPC, and GN dip.

Other medical conditions include acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral neuropathy. The patient has been started on atorv"

   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs: switch from Zosyn to Levofloxacin for better coverage of
   Moraxella Catarrhalis in sputum, continue Vanc, add Gentamycin for
   synergistic effect in case endocarditis. Also daily BCx x2, TEE to r/o
   endocarditis when able (not ordered yet)
   - RIJ placed. During this pt had small run of V-tach with rate 110s,
   improved after carotid massage to 70s. Likely related to guidewire
   removal.
   - Renal replaced L femoral CVVH line with L IJ. Line was short, so will
   be exchanged today.
   - R femoral Swann-Ganz and sheath removed, as well as L femoral CVVH
   line
   - Heparin resumed while on 1:2
   - Low-dose Dopamine had been added to Vasopressin for BP support.
   Planned to wean off IABP then pressors, but overnight at 3:45a had a
   ~20min run of V-tach with HR in 60s, MAPS down to 60s, lytes were wnl.
   Pt was sleeping at the time. IABP was switched back to 1:1 for
   improvement of MAPS. Responded to carotid massage with return of sinus
   rhythm, HR back down to 70s, MAPS up to 70s-80s.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain, and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including cardiogenic shock, sepsis/bacteremia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, and coronary artery disease. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. 

His vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.8°C, heart rate 83 bpm, blood pressure 77/47 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on supplemental oxygen. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, creatinine, lactate, and cardiac biomarkers. Blood cultures have grown coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus. 

The patient's medical history includes a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, acute gastrointestinal bleeding, and a history of dilated cardiomyopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated cardiac enzymes indicate a possible cardiogenic shock, which is a serious condition that occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body"

   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:
   - Shock picture now is a combination of cardiogenic with
   distributative.
   - Low-dose Dopamine added to Vasopressin yest for BP support -
   Cardiogenic shock is complicated by septic shock
 currently off
   dopamine since 3AM and IABP weaned to 3:1
   - Plan to DC IABP this am as pt tolerated wean yest
   - Continue vasopressin for now
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Coag + S. aureus bacteremia as of [**2190-2-8**]. Once
   off levophed PVR < WNL consistent with a distributive shock.
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Continue vanco + low dose gent dosed for CVVH
   - Will increase Vancomycin to 1gm Q12 given low random level this am
   (level 12 on random level drawn 10hrs early)
   - Continue levaquin for Morexella in sputum
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Lines changed yest with HD line changed and PA sheath pulled. Unable
   to wean off IABP
   - Tylenol PRN for now to control temp and reduce drive for tachycardia
   and ectopy
   .
   # VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA:
   Ongoing Respiratory distress: Pt with rib fractures from fall +
   pulmonary edema from acute systolic CHF. Intubated [**1-25**] respiratory
   distress and tiring from effort. Now with left sided infiltrate and
   sputum with GNR, GPC, and GN Dip
   - Continue intubation for now
 consider change to PSV today, check
   RISBI in am
   - Continue to pull off fluid with CVVH
   - Extubate as soon as possible once volume status controlled.
   - Continue Vanc/levo per ID recs
   .
   # Acute hepatitis
 patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary
   to cardiogenic shock.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - continue pressors to maintain adequate MAP
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   ..
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On
   arrival patient with Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6. No known h/o renal
   disease.  feNa < 1% on urine lytes. Etiology includes hypotension, poor
   forward flow in setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock.  Renal was
   consulted and started CVVH in order to remove fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.
   - cont. ASA, statin, hep drip
   - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Had significant pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation.   - Monitor I/O with goal -100mL/hr with CVVH.
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.
   .
   # DM: On 3 oral medications at home.  Received contrast at OSH so

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization.
   .
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:
   - Shock picture now is a combination of cardiogenic with
   distributative.
   - Cont. balloon pump, 1:1 with goal MAP>60 and goal CI 2.0, if
   possible, will try to wean down to 2:1 though his MAPS this
     morning are only in the low 60s.
   - Low-dose Dopamine added to Vasopressin for BP support - Cardiogenic
   shock is complicated by septic shock
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Coag + S. aureus bacteremia as of [**2190-2-8**]. Once
   off levophed PVR < WNL consistent with a distributive shock.
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Continue vanco + low dose gent dosed for CVVH
   - Continue levaquin for Morexella in sputum
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Lines changed yest with HD line changed and PA sheath pulled. Unable
   to wean off IABP
   - Tylenol PRN for now to control temp and reduce drive for tachycardia
   and ectopy
   .
   # VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA:
   Ongoing Respiratory distress: Pt with rib fractures from fall +
   pulmonary edema from acute systolic CHF. Intubated [**1-25**] respiratory
   distress and tiring from effort. Now with left sided infiltrate and
   sputum with GNR, GPC, and GN Dip
   - Continue intubation for now
   - Continue to pull off fluid with CVVH
   - Extubate as soon as possible once volume status controlled.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis
 patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary
   to cardiogenic shock.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - continue pressors to maintain adequate MAP
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   ..
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On
   arrival patient with Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6. No known h/o renal
   disease.  feNa < 1% on urine lytes. Etiology includes hypotension, poor
   forward flow in setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock.  Renal was
   consulted and started CVVH in order to remove fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.
   - cont. ASA, statin, hep drip
   - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Had significant pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation.   Has PA catheter to monitor hemodynamics.
   - Monitor I/O with goal -100mL/hr with CVVH.
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure
   - repeat TTE pending to assess cardiac function (planned for today)
   - Daily CXR to assess PA cath and balloon location
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.
   .
   # DM: On 3 oral medications at home.  Received contrast at OSH so
   holding metformin.  In setting of acute illness will hold all oral
   meds.
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   - Cont to follow [**Hospital1 **]
   - guaiac stools
   - Transfuse this morning (<25)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - cont atorvastatin
   .
   # Peripheral neuropathy: On gabapentin as outpatient.
   - Restart once stable

   Disposition:
","The patient's progress note indicates that they are experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has a history of CAD, recent MI, and GIB, which may have contributed to cardiogenic shock. They are currently on a balloon pump and receiving vasopressor support.

2. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and sepsis. Antibiotics have been initiated, and daily surveillance blood cultures are being continued.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has left-sided infiltrate and sputum with GNR, GPC, and GN dip, suggesting VAP. Intubation will continue for now, and efforts will be made to wean off the ventilator once the patient's volume status is controlled.

4. Acute Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver function tests, possibly secondary to cardiogenic shock. Liver function tests are being trended, and low-dose Tylenol is being given for fever.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline renal function is unknown, but their serum creatinine has increased from 1.9 at OSH to 3.6. CVVH has been started to remove fluid and improve renal function.

6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD"

   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs: switch from Zosyn to Levofloxacin for better coverage of
   Moraxella Catarrhalis in sputum, continue Vanc, add Gentamycin for
   synergistic effect in case endocarditis. Also daily BCx x2, TEE to r/o
   endocarditis when able (not ordered yet)
   - RIJ placed. During this pt had small run of V-tach with rate 110s,
   improved after carotid massage to 70s. Likely related to guidewire
   removal.
   - Renal replaced L femoral CVVH line with L IJ. Line was short, so will
   be exchanged today.
   - R femoral Swann-Ganz and sheath removed, as well as L femoral CVVH
   line
   - Heparin resumed while on 1:2
   - Low-dose Dopamine had been added to Vasopressin for BP support.
   Planned to wean off IABP then pressors, but overnight at 3:45a had a
   ~20min run of V-tach with HR in 60s, MAPS down to 60s, lytes were wnl.
   Pt was sleeping at the time. IABP was switched back to 1:1 for
   improvement of MAPS. Responded to carotid massage with return of sinus
   rhythm, HR back down to 70s, MAPS up to 70s-80s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and septic shock. He presented to the ICU with severe sepsis and was found to have evidence of endocarditis. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. He has undergone multiple interventions including central venous catheter placement, arterial line placement, and renal replacement therapy.

The patient's vital signs remain unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. His blood glucose levels have been elevated. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and liver enzymes. Cardiac markers such as troponin-T and CK-MB are elevated, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Renal function tests reveal worsening renal failure.

The patient continues to require aggressive management with vasopressin, dopamine, and IABP support for hemodynamic stability. Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted based on sensitivities. Repeat echocardiogram is pending to assess the progression of endocarditis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's presentation suggests evidence of endocarditis, which can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and systemic infection.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and tachycardia indicate ongoing septic shock, which can result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. Acute Renal Failure"

   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with cardiogenic and septic shock
   .
   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:
   - Shock picture now is a combination of cardiogenic with
   distributative.
   - Patient only maintained on low dose Vasopressin
   - intra aortic balloon pump was d/c yesterday
   - Continue vasopressin for now
   - unable to run patient more negative given borderline blood pressures
   on CVVH
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Coag + S. aureus bacteremia as of [**2190-2-8**]. Once
   off levophed PVR < WNL consistent with a distributive shock.
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures
   - switched vanco to nafcillin yesterday as per ID with sensitivies
   - Continue low dose gent dosed for CVVH
   - Continue levaquin for Morexella in sputum
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Lines changed yest with HD line changed and PA sheath pulled.
   - weaned off IABP yesterday
   - Tylenol PRN for now to control temp and reduce drive for tachycardia
   and ectopy
   .
   # VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA:
   Ongoing Respiratory distress: Pt with rib fractures from fall +
   pulmonary edema from acute systolic CHF. Intubated [**1-25**] respiratory
   distress and tiring from effort. Now with left sided infiltrate and
   sputum with GNR, GPC, and GN Dip
   - Continue intubation for now
 was unable to do pressure support trial
   yesterday will try today, check RISBI in am
   - Continue to pull off fluid with CVVH
   - Extubate as soon as possible once volume status controlled.
   - Continue Nafcillin/levo/gentamicin per ID recs
   .
   # Acute hepatitis
 patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary
   to cardiogenic shock which continue to improve.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - continue pressors to maintain adequate MAP
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   ..
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On
   arrival patient with Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6. No known h/o renal
   disease.  feNa < 1% on urine lytes. Etiology includes hypotension, poor
   forward flow in setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock.  Renal was
   consulted and started CVVH in order to remove fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.
   - cont. ASA, statin, hep drip
   - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Had significant pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation.   - Monitor I/O with goal -100mL/hr with CVVH.
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.
   .
   # DM: On 3 oral medications at home.  Received contrast at OSH so
   holding metformin.  In setting of acute illness will hold all oral
   meds.  Patient has had has elevated fingersticks.  Started patient on
   long acting Lantus yesterday and increased sliding scale.
   - consider uptitiration of lantus as required
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   Patient got 1 unit of blood yesterday without appropriate bump in
   hematocrit.
   - Cont to follow [**Hospital1 **]
   - guaiac stools
   - Transfuse for HCT <25
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - cont atorvastatin
   .
   # Peripheral neuropathy: On gabapentin as outpatient.
   - Restart once stable

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presents with nausea, vomiting, ongoing chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock and septic shock due to coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. 

The patient's current condition includes ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, and coronary artery disease. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, liver enzymes, creatinine, lactate, and cardiac biomarkers.

The patient's medical management includes vasopressin for cardiogenic shock, antibiotics for sepsis, nafcillin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, CVVH for acute kidney injury, and insulin for glycemic control. The patient's lines have been changed, and his dialysis catheter was placed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening cardiogenic shock, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and hepatic dysfunction. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, fluid status, and laboratory values will be crucial in managing these potential complications."

   # CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:
   - Shock picture now is a combination of cardiogenic with
   distributative.
   - Patient only maintained on low dose Vasopressin
   - intra aortic balloon pump was d/c yesterday
   - Continue vasopressin for now
   - unable to run patient more negative given borderline blood pressures
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Coag + S. aureus bacteremia as of [**2190-2-8**]. Once
   off levophed PVR < WNL consistent with a distributive shock.
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Continue vanco + low dose gent dosed for CVVH
   - Will increase Vancomycin to 1gm Q12 given low random level this am
   (level 12 on random level drawn 10hrs early)
   - Continue levaquin for Morexella in sputum
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Lines changed yest with HD line changed and PA sheath pulled. Unable
   to wean off IABP
   - Tylenol PRN for now to control temp and reduce drive for tachycardia
   and ectopy
   .
   # VENTILATOR ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA:
   Ongoing Respiratory distress: Pt with rib fractures from fall +
   pulmonary edema from acute systolic CHF. Intubated [**1-25**] respiratory
   distress and tiring from effort. Now with left sided infiltrate and
   sputum with GNR, GPC, and GN Dip
   - Continue intubation for now
 consider change to PSV today, check
   RISBI in am
   - Continue to pull off fluid with CVVH
   - Extubate as soon as possible once volume status controlled.
   - Continue Vanc/levo per ID recs
   .
   # Acute hepatitis
 patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary
   to cardiogenic shock.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - continue pressors to maintain adequate MAP
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   ..
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On
   arrival patient with Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6. No known h/o renal
   disease.  feNa < 1% on urine lytes. Etiology includes hypotension, poor
   forward flow in setting of heart failure, cardiogenic shock.  Renal was
   consulted and started CVVH in order to remove fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.
   - cont. ASA, statin, hep drip
   - hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Had significant pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation.   - Monitor I/O with goal -100mL/hr with CVVH.
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure
   .
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.
   .
   # DM: On 3 oral medications at home.  Received contrast at OSH so
   holding metformin.  In setting of acute illness will hold all oral
   meds.
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   - Cont to follow [**Hospital1 **]
   - guaiac stools
   - Transfuse yest 1U PRBC for HCT <25
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - cont atorvastatin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock due to acute systolic congestive heart failure and ongoing chest pain. The patient requires vasopressor support and an intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain adequate blood pressure and coronary perfusion.

2. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Antibiotics have been changed to nafcillin and gentamicin, with plans to continue vancomycin and levofloxacin. Daily surveillance blood cultures are also being obtained.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed left-sided infiltrates and sputum cultures positive for GNR, GPC, and GN dip. The patient will continue to be intubated and receive appropriate antibiotics.

4. Acute Hepatitis: The patient has significantly elevated liver function tests, suggesting acute hepatitis. Trending LFTs and continuing pressors to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) are recommended.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline renal function is unknown, but they have a creatinine level of 2.5 on admission, which has increased to 3.6. CVVH has been initiated to remove excess fluid and treat AKI.

6. Coronaries: The patient has a"

   Chief Complaint: sepsis
   24 Hour Events:
   - FS glucose 414. Gave 21U humalog and increased SS
   - issues with dialysis line working, renal advanced line over wire and
   line began to work
   - spoke with ID, plan to change antibiotics from Vancomycin to
   Nafcillin, continue gentamicin and levoquin for now
   - pharmacy initially concerned with Nafcillin dosing - based on
   abnormal liver function tests thought that dose should be cut in half,
   however discussed with [**Doctor First Name **] and [**Last Name (un) **] and decided to keep current dose
   where it is
   - started patient on glargine 10 units at bedtime as well as increased
   insulin sliding scale for eleavted glucose
   - initial plan to place an arterial line however RN felt like patient
   had been through a lot already today and was getting good readings with
   manual blood pressure cuff so decided to defer and readdress tomorrow,
   discuss with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **] who was fine with this
   - ordered for blood tranfusion with repeat crit 23.5
   - balloon pump was discontinued
   - ET tube was advanced and chest x-ray repeated: which demonstrated:
   - cath tip was cultured and demonstrated coag + staph, other cultures
   unchanged from previous
   - echo still not done today
   - repeat chest x-ray PM not read but per our read ET tube 4 cm above
   carina so did not advance
   - will do pressure support trial in the AM (deferred this evening as
   trouble earlier with CVVH machine which is working better now)

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presented with nausea and vomiting and is now experiencing cardiogenic shock and septic shock. The patient has multiple comorbidities including pneumonia, acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's condition indicates cardiogenic shock, which is a severe drop in blood pressure that can lead to organ failure.
2. Septic Shock: The presence of sepsis and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia suggests the possibility of septic shock, which can result in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress, left-sided infiltrate, and sputum culture indicating Moraxella may indicate community-acquired pneumonia. This can progress to severe pneumonia or lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to endotracheal intubation.
4. Acute Hepatitis: The significantly elevated liver function tests suggest acute hepatitis. It is crucial to identify the cause and manage the patient appropriately to prevent further liver damage.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's worsening renal function, as indicated by increased creatinine levels, suggests AKI. This could be due to hypotension, poor renal perfusion, or cardiogenic"

   Chief Complaint: sepsis
   24 Hour Events:
   - FS glucose 414. Gave 21U humalog and increased SS
   - issues with dialysis line working, renal advanced line over wire and
   line began to work
   - spoke with ID, plan to change antibiotics from Vancomycin to
   Nafcillin, continue gentamicin and levoquin for now
   - pharmacy initially concerned with Nafcillin dosing - based on
   abnormal liver function tests thought that dose should be cut in half,
   however discussed with [**Doctor First Name **] and [**Last Name (un) **] and decided to keep current dose
   where it is
   - started patient on glargine 10 units at bedtime as well as increased
   insulin sliding scale for eleavted glucose
   - initial plan to place an arterial line however RN felt like patient
   had been through a lot already today and was getting good readings with
   manual blood pressure cuff so decided to defer and readdress tomorrow,
   discuss with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **] who was fine with this
   - ordered for blood tranfusion with repeat crit 23.5
   - balloon pump was discontinued
   - ET tube was advanced and chest x-ray repeated: which demonstrated:
   - cath tip was cultured and demonstrated coag + staph, other cultures
   unchanged from previous
   - echo still not done today
   - repeat chest x-ray PM not read but per our read ET tube 4 cm above
   carina so did not advance
   - will do pressure support trial in the AM (deferred this evening as
   trouble earlier with CVVH machine which is working better now)

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. He is now experiencing cardiogenic shock and septic shock.

The patient has several medical complications, including pneumonia, acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, and anemia. He also has a history of peripheral neuropathy and hyperlipidemia. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He has multiple lines and tubes inserted, including central venous catheters, arterial lines, and a urinary catheter.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, lactate, and cardiac biomarkers. His kidney function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. His coagulation profile shows a prolonged PT/INR and PTT.

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotic therapy for sepsis, CVVH for acute kidney injury, insulin for hyperglycemia, and anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. He is being closely monitored for various parameters, including fluid balance, hemodynamics, and respiratory status.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and recent fall who presented with nausea and vomiting. He has ongoing cardiogenic shock and septic shock, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The patient's medical history includes a previous myocardial infarction (MI), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and dilated cardiomyopathy. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and cardiac biomarkers. His renal function is impaired, and he is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient is also being treated for suspected pneumonia, hepatitis, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's condition is complicated by cardiogenic shock, which is a result of his underlying CAD and dilated cardiomyopathy. This can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and increased risk of mortality.
2. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to a bacterial infection, specifically coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This infection may have originated from a central line or another source, leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and septic shock.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presented with nausea and vomiting and ongoing chest pain (CP). The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes (CE) and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. He is now experiencing cardiogenic and septic shock. The patient has been started on insulin for tight glycemic control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing leukocytosis and bacteremia with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He is being treated with nafcillin and gentamicin. There is a concern for endocarditis, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been scheduled.
2. Shock: The patient's shock picture is a combination of cardiogenic (regional variability) with distributive. He is maintained on low-dose dopamine and has been weaned off vasopressin. His low central venous pressure (CVP) and clinical dryness suggest running even without fluid administration.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have community-acquired pneumonia caused by Moraxella catarrhalis. He is being treated with levofloxacin 750mg q48h.

   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with cardiogenic and septic shock
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Coag + MSSA
   - On naf/gent for MSSA
   - on levo for moroxella
   - Remains with ongoing leukocytosis.
   - TEE for endocarditis today
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Given ongoing bacteremia, concern for endocarditis. TEE today. Was
   made NPO after MN.
   # SHOCK:  IABP d/c
d on [**2-10**].
   - Shock picture now is a combination of cardiogenic (regional
   variability) with distributative.
   - Patient only maintained on low dose dopamine with MAPs >60.  Now off
   vasopressin
   - Low CVP and clinically dry so running even now
   - Consider stopped CVVH today and following volume status and
   electrolytes
   .
   .
   # PNEUMONIA: Suspect Community acquired given moraxella.
   - Continuing levofloxacin 750mg q48h
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   On pressure support this am, but did not tolerate secondary to
   agitation and tachypnea, switched back to AC.
   Remains requiring a high level of pressure support when on CPAP.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis
 patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary
   to cardiogenic shock which continue to improve.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - continue pressors to maintain adequate MAP
 wean today.
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury:
   - continue CVVH for now.  Per renal plan to continue CVVH until UOP
   1000cc/day.
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   ..
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA
   - [**Month (only) 11**] be hemolysis, no schistocytes seen on recent smear/
   - more indirect yesterday, indirect pending today.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need RUQ u/s if more direct
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.
   .
   # DM: On insulin gtt for tight glycemic control.
   - Will need to start insulin gtt for better BG control today with q1H
   finger sticks.
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   Patient got 1 unit of blood yesterday without appropriate bump in
   hematocrit.
   - guaiac stools.  Negative so far.
   - Transfuse for HCT <25.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - cont atorvastatin
   .
   # Peripheral neuropathy: On gabapentin as outpatient.
   - Restart once stable

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing cardiogenic and septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia and is being treated with nafcillin and gentamicin. He also has pneumonia caused by Moraxella and is receiving levofloxacin.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors. He has cardiogenic shock due to multivessel CAD and a severely reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 14%. He also has severe global and regional systolic dysfunction, as well as mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Additionally, he has moderate aortic regurgitation, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and a dilated aortic root.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, requiring high levels of pressure support ventilation. He is intubated and sedated with midazolam. His arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 37, HCO3 of 21, base excess of -3, oxygen saturation of 100%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 303.

The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) and is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). His blood urea nitrogen"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Changed to insulin drip with better glycemic control
   - Catheter tip grew MSSA
   - ECHO showed EF 14% with a dilated left ventricle with severe global
   and regional systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD including a
   prior extensive inferior wall infarction. Mild right ventricular
   systolic dysfunction. Aortic stenosis, probably moderate. Mild aortic
   regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
   hypertension. Dilated aortic root.
   - Aline placed after several attempts
   - Initially weaned off vasopressin but MAPS in the 50s. Started
   dopamine 2.5 with improved MAPS
   - Held off on CVVH filtration and tried Lasix 40mg IVx1 with minimal
   UOP
   - Attempted pressure support ventilation but Pt became agitated and
   tachypneic
   - CVPs dropped to 3 with also lower MAPs and BP. Held off on
   ultrafiltration
   - Running even given low CVP
   - Rising WBC. Concerning for Cdiff versus need to broaden Abx
   - Switched to midazolam drip for better sedation and improved liver
   function
   - PLT falling. Now 117 from 183 on admission

   # Acute Kidney Injury: Unknown baseline.  Cr at OSH was 1.9.  On
   arrival patient with Cr 2.5 now trended up to 3.6, now improved on
   CVVH. No known h/o renal disease.  feNa < 1% on urine lytes. Etiology
   includes hypotension, poor forward flow in setting of heart failure,
   cardiogenic shock.  Renal was consulted and started CVVH in order to
   remove fluid.
   - continue CVVH for now.  Per renal plan to continue CVVH until UOP
   1000cc/day.
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins

   # CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD, 3VD on cath in [**8-31**].
   Recent NSTEMI in [**8-31**] in setting of acute GIB which was treated
   medically.  Now has significantly elevated biomarkers with associated
   EKG changes with a cath that demonstrates no evidence of acute infarct
   so likely that patient has global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   hypotension.  Stat bedside ECHO shows significantly depressed LV
   function, however did have severe global LV dysfunction on TTE on
   [**Month (only) **].  CK and MB trending up indicative of evolving MI, trop 3.88.
   Patient had balloon pump placed to increase coronary perfusion.
   - cont. ASA, statin, hep drip

   # PUMP:  Has h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic given 3VD on
   cath.  Previous EF 25%. Bedside TTE suggests worsened global LV
   hypokinesis in setting of acute MI.  Had significant pulmonary edema
   requiring intubation.   - Monitor I/O with goal -100mL/hr with CVVH.
   - BB on hold given relative hypotension
   - cont aspirin, statin
   - ACE inhibitor on hold in the setting of hypotension and renal failure

   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   Patient got 1 unit of blood yesterday without appropriate bump in

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea and vomiting and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes. He was diagnosed with cardiogenic shock and septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is suspected. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and he has a tracheostomy tube in place. He has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with a previous ejection fraction of 25%. He also has acute hepatitis, acute kidney injury, and anemia of chronic disease. The patient's blood cultures are positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. He has a history of peripheral neuropathy and is on gabapentin. His most recent laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and recent myocardial infarction put him at risk for cardiogenic shock, which has been confirmed by the presence of elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes. This condition can lead to poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Septic shock: The patient has evidence of septic shock as indicated by positive blood cultures for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This condition can lead to systemic"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with cardiogenic and septic shock
   .
   # ID:
   SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Coag + MSSA, with rising white count.  Differential
   of elevated WBC count includes lung (CAP vs VAP) vs abdomen (C. diff
   or cholecystitis given elevated bili) vs lines (recently changed).  No
   open sores.  TEE negative for endocarditis.
   - On nafcillin for MSSA.  Gentamicin stopped yesterday given negative
   TEE.
   - On levo for moroxella
   - Begin empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl.
   - Check RUQ US given elevated T bili with low grade fever, WBC.
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures.  Follow micro data.
   - Could also consider sinus evaluation if no other source becomes
   apparent.
   - Add on urine culture
   # SHOCK:  Previously had been combination of cardiogenic plus septic,
   now appears to be more consistent with septic shock, althought does
   have very low EF.  IABP d/c
d on [**2-10**].  Continues to require dopamine
   for pressure support which is likely more related to infectious
   process.
   - Patient only maintained on low dose dopamine with MAPs >60.  Now off
   vasopressin
   - CVP 12 so room for diuresis with close monitoring of BPs.
   - Treatment of infectious processes as above.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Tolerated pressure support [**2-12**] but did not tolerate secondary to
   agitation and tachypnea, switched back to AC.  No trials of pressure
   support overnight.
   - Needs further diuresis and then will trial PS.  Patient is 3L
   positive LOS.
   - Consider alternative forms of sedation to have less effect on BP.
   Try Ativan today.
   - Concentrate intake if possible.

   # Acute hepatitis: patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary to
   cardiogenic shock which continue to improve.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury:  Urinary output is improving.
   - continue CVVH for now.  Per renal plan to continue CVVH until UOP
   1000cc/day.
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   ..
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Does not appear to be hemolysis, concern for RUQ
   source of infection given elevated bili.
   - Order portable RUQ u/s if more direct
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of community-acquired pneumonia, anxiety, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, septic shock, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and other medical conditions. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/50 to 122/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics (levofloxacin, gentamicin, and nafcillin), sedatives (midazolam and fentanyl), and dopamine infusion. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,477 mL and output of 2,488 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (31.4 K/uL), low hemoglobin level (9.0 g/dL), elevated blood glucose level (88 mg/dL), and abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL, BUN: 26 mg/dL). Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 449/96), abnormal electrolyte levels (Na+/K+: 19 mEq"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presented with nausea and vomiting and ongoing chest pain, which led to the diagnosis of elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient now has cardiogenic and septic shock, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, acute hepatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, rhythm disturbances, diabetes mellitus, anemia (chronic kidney disease), hyperlipidemia, and peripheral neuropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing leukocytosis and bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis. Continuous surveillance blood cultures will be done, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to evaluate for endocarditis.
2. Shock: The patient's shock picture is a combination of cardiogenic (regional variability) with distributive. Low dose dopamine is being used to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAPs) >60.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with cardiogenic and septic shock
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Coag + MSSA
   - On naf/gent for MSSA
   - on levo for moroxella
   - Remains with ongoing leukocytosis.
   - TEE for endocarditis today
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures
   - Given ongoing bacteremia, concern for endocarditis. TEE today. Was
   made NPO after MN.
   # SHOCK:  IABP d/c
d on [**2-10**].
   - Shock picture now is a combination of cardiogenic (regional
   variability) with distributative.
   - Patient only maintained on low dose dopamine with MAPs >60.  Now off
   vasopressin
   - Low CVP and clinically dry so running even now
   - Consider stopped CVVH today and following volume status and
   electrolytes
   .
   # PNEUMONIA: Suspect Community acquired given moraxella.
   - Continuing levofloxacin 750mg q48h
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   On pressure support this am, but did not tolerate secondary to
   agitation and tachypnea, switched back to AC.
   Remains requiring a high level of pressure support when on CPAP.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis
 patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary
   to cardiogenic shock which continue to improve.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - continue pressors to maintain adequate MAP
 wean today.
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury:
   - continue CVVH for now.  Per renal plan to continue CVVH until UOP
   1000cc/day.
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   ..
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA
   - [**Month (only) 11**] be hemolysis, no schistocytes seen on recent smear/
   - more indirect yesterday, indirect pending today.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need RUQ u/s if more direct
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.
   .
   # DM: On insulin gtt for tight glycemic control.
   - Will need to start insulin gtt for better BG control today with q1H
   finger sticks.
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   Patient got 1 unit of blood yesterday without appropriate bump in
   hematocrit.
   - guaiac stools.  Negative so far.
   - Transfuse for HCT <25.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - cont atorvastatin
   .
   # Peripheral neuropathy: On gabapentin as outpatient.
   - Restart once stable
   .
   FEN:  OG tube placed yesterday, TFs at goal.

   Disposition:
","The patient's medical progress note indicates several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing leukocytosis and bacteremia, suggesting an infection in the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis and potentially endocarditis. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for MSSA and Moraxella.

2. Shock: The patient is experiencing a combination of cardiogenic and distributive shock. The low CVP and dryness indicate inadequate perfusion. Pressors are being used to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP).

3. Pneumonia: The patient is suspected to have community-acquired pneumonia, possibly caused by Moraxella. Levofloxacin is being continued to treat this infection.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires a high level of pressure support on the ventilator due to agitation and tachypnea. Weaning to CPAP has been unsuccessful.

5. Acute Hepatitis: The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), suggesting acute hepatitis. This could be secondary to cardiogenic shock.

6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient is experiencing acute kidney injury, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being continued until the urine output reaches 1000cc/day.

7. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which may be due to hemolysis or liver dysfunction. Further investigation is"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with cardiogenic and septic shock
   .
   # ID:
   SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Coag + MSSA, with rising white count.  Differential
   of elevated WBC count includes lung (CAP vs VAP) vs abdomen (C. diff
   or cholecystitis given elevated bili) vs lines (recently changed).  No
   open sores.  TEE negative for endocarditis.
   - On nafcillin for MSSA.  Gentamicin stopped yesterday given negative
   TEE.
   - On levo for moroxella
   - Begin empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl.
   - Check RUQ US given elevated T bili with low grade fever, WBC.
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures.  Follow micro data.
   - Could also consider sinus evaluation if no other source becomes
   apparent.
   - Add on urine culture
   # SHOCK:  Previously had been combination of cardiogenic plus septic,
   now appears to be more consistent with septic shock, althought does
   have very low EF.  IABP d/c
d on [**2-10**].  Continues to require dopamine
   for pressure support which is likely more related to infectious
   process.
   - Patient only maintained on low dose dopamine with MAPs >60.  Now off
   vasopressin
   - CVP 12 so room for diuresis with close monitoring of BPs.
   - Treatment of infectious processes as above.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Tolerated pressure support [**2-12**] but did not tolerate secondary to
   agitation and tachypnea, switched back to AC.  No trials of pressure
   support overnight.
   - Needs further diuresis and then will trial PS.  Patient is 3L
   positive LOS.
   - Consider alternative forms of sedation to have less effect on BP.
   Try Ativan today.
   - Concentrate intake if possible.
   .
   # Acute hepatitis: patient with LFTs in the 1000s suspect  secondary to
   cardiogenic shock which continue to improve.
   - trend LFTs, improving
   - low dose Tylenol for fever
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury:  Urinary output is improving.
   - continue CVVH for now.  Per renal plan to continue CVVH until UOP
   1000cc/day.
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   ..
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Does not appear to be hemolysis, concern for RUQ
   source of infection given elevated bili.
   - Order portable RUQ u/s if more direct
   # RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm, in the setting of respiratory distress patient
   developed sinus tachycardia to 130s
   - cont. tele, less ectopy.
   .
   # DM: On insulin gtt for tight glycemic control.
   - Continue insulin gtt for better BG control today with q1H finger
   sticks especially while on TF.
   - FS qid
   - HISS
   .
   # ANEMIA (CKD): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was 31.6 in [**2186**].
   On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly below baseline at 29.
   Given h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.  Repeated iron studies
   here with low iron 14 and elevated ferritin which suggests likely
   anemia of chronic disease rather than solely iron deficiency anemia.
   Patient got 1 unit of blood yesterday without appropriate bump in
   hematocrit.
   - guaiac stools.  Negative so far.
   - Transfuse for HCT <25.
   - Stop heparin
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home.  In setting of NSTEMI will start
   atorvastatin 80mg. On admission here HDL 36, LDL 56
   - Hold lipitor for now given multiple other medical problems.
   .
   # Peripheral neuropathy: On gabapentin as outpatient.
   - Restart once stable
   .
   FEN:  OG tube in place, TFs at goal.  Reglan for h/o gastroparesis.
   ACCESS: PIV's x 3 (20g x 2, 18g x 1), L IJ HD line, R IJ.  Aline in

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient is now experiencing cardiogenic and septic shock. 

The patient has been treated with antibiotics for MSSA and is currently on nafcillin. Gentamicin was stopped after a negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The patient is also being treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) with oral Flagyl. 

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, and he has not tolerated pressure support ventilation due to agitation and tachypnea. He is currently on assist-control ventilation (AC). 

The patient's renal function is improving, and he is continuing with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). 

The patient has hyperbilirubinemia, which may be due to an RUQ source of infection given elevated bilirubin levels. 

The patient's rhythm is sinus, but he developed sinus tachycardia in the setting of respiratory distress. 

The patient has diabetes mellitus and is being managed with insulin. 

The patient has anemia with a baseline hematocrit of 29%, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with multifactorial shock.
   SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA:
   - On nafcillin for MSSA (monotherapy given TEE Neg endocarditis)
   - Began empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl. Neg todate
   - RUQ showed sludge, no e/o acute chole
   - Will scan abd/pelvis with contrast today.
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures.  Follow micro data.
   - UCx Pending
   - most recent sputum cultures with yeast, however patient on ventilator
   so unclear what to make of this, continue daily sputums
   # COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: ID of moraxella, Treated with
   levofloxacin dosed renally, now completed course.
   # SHOCK: Patient is still persistently hypotensive requiring addition
   of vasopressin in addition to dopamine yesterday. Dopamine could not be
   titrated up furthur yesterday secondary to ectopy. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as
   resolving septic shock (+ blood cultures, CAP). Patient previously on
   intraaortic balloon pump now off.
   - cont pressors for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60
   - Will still try and get fluid off to be able to wean off AC vent
   control; improve forward flow.
   - cont Nafcillin for TEE negative bacteremia, continue empiric
   treatment for c. diff with PO flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient failed pressure support trial yesterday
   with HR increasing as well as BP dropping required additional pressor
   support with vasopressin. Last gas with adequate oxyugenation as well
   as low-normal CO2.  Think that respiratory failure likely from fluid
   overload in the setting of acute systolic heart failure. Yesterday was
   first day that CVVH had been successful in making patient negative.
   - cont to make patient negative goal -1 Liter
   - as patient improves hemodynamically continue pressure support/RISB
   trials
   .
   # ACUTE HEPATITIS: Improving from max of 1000s likely from shock liver
   in the setting of low cardiac output.
   - trend LFTS
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Does not appear to be hemolysis, concern for RUQ
   source of infection given elevated bili. Patient had RUQ yesterday
   which demonstrated no acute pathology some sludging.
   - cont to trend
   # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:
   - continue CVVH for now.  Per renal plan to continue CVVH until UOP
   1000cc/day.
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   # RHYTHM: Ectopy, worse with increased doses of dopamin
   # DM: Switch back to insulin gtt
   # ANEMIA (CKD+Inflammation): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was
   31.6 in [**2186**], and On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly
   below baseline at 29.  Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.
   - Stopped heparin yesterday
   - Crit is stable
   - would not transfuse this morning
   # PERIPHERAL EOSINOPHILIA: new today, absolute count 640. will follow,
   consider adrenal insufficiency, fungal process
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presents with nausea, vomiting, ongoing cardiogenic shock, elevated cardiac enzymes, and EKG changes. The patient has been treated for MSSA bacteremia, C. diff infection, and community-acquired pneumonia. He is currently experiencing hypotension requiring vasopressin and dopamine, respiratory failure due to fluid overload, acute hepatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, acute kidney injury, rhythm abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, anemia, peripheral eosinophilia, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral neuropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's ongoing cardiogenic shock is a significant concern. The low cardiac output may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to fluid overload in the setting of acute systolic heart failure. Continued respiratory support and careful fluid management are necessary.
3. Acute Hepatitis: The patient's acute hepatitis may be related to shock liver secondary to low cardiac output. Close monitoring of liver function tests is required.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with multifactorial shock.
   SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA:
   - On nafcillin for MSSA (monotherapy given TEE Neg endocarditis)
   - Began empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl. Neg todate
   - RUQ showed sludge, no e/o acute chole
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures.  Follow micro data.
   - Could also consider sinus evaluation if no other source becomes
     apparent.
   - UCx Pending
   - most recent sputum cultures with yeast, however patient on ventilator
   so unclear what to make of this, continue daily sputums
   - consider pan-scan today of sinuses as well as abdomen to rule out
   occult infection
   # COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: ID of moraxella, Treated with
   levofloxacin dosed renally, now completed course.
   # SHOCK: Patient is still persistently hypotensive requiring addition
   of vasopressin in addition to dopamine yesterday. Dopamine could not be
   titrated up furthur yesterday secondary to ectopy. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as
   resolving septic shock (+ blood cultures, CAP). Patient previously on
   intraaortic balloon pump now off.
   - cont pressors for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60
   - cont Nafcillin for TEE negative bacteremia, continue empiric
   treatment for c. diff with PO flagyl
   - completed course of levofloxacin
   - f/u cultures
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient failed pressure support trial yesterday
   with HR increasing as well as BP dropping required additional pressor
   support with vasopressin. Last gas with adequate oxyugenation as well
   as low-normal CO2.  Think that respiratory failure likely from fluid
   overload in the setting of acute systolic heart failure. Yesterday was
   first day that CVVH had been successful in making patient negative.
   - cont to make patient negative goal -1 Liter
   - as patient improves hemodynamically continue pressure support/RISB
   trials
   .
   # ACUTE HEPATITIS: Improving from max of 1000s likely from shock liver
   in the setting of low cardiac output.
   - trend LFTS
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Does not appear to be hemolysis, concern for RUQ
   source of infection given elevated bili. Patient had RUQ yesterday
   which demonstrated no acute pathology some sludging.
   - cont to trend
   # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:
   - continue CVVH for now.  Per renal plan to continue CVVH until UOP
   1000cc/day.
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   # RHYTHM: Ectopy, worse with increased doses of dopamin
   # DM: ON RISS and intermittent sliding scale
   # ANEMIA (CKD+Inflammation): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was
   31.6 in [**2186**], and On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly
   below baseline at 29.  Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.
   - Stopped heparin yesterday
   - Crit is stable
   - would not transfuse this morning
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk
   management
   # NEUROPATHY, PERIPHERAL: On gabapentin as outpatient, inactive issue,
   holding.
   FEN:  OG tube in place, TFs at goal.  Reglan for h/o gastroparesis.
   ACCESS: PIV's x 3 (20g x 2, 18g x 1), L IJ HD line, R IJ.  Aline in
   place.
   PROPHYLAXIS:  Hep subq, PPI given intubated.  No need for bowel regimen
   as patient with soft stools.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall who presented with nausea and vomiting and ongoing cardiogenic shock. He has elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient is now experiencing multifactorial shock.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require attention. These include:

1. SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: The patient is being treated with nafcillin for MSSA (monotherapy given TEE negative endocarditis) and empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl. Negative to date. The patient's recent sputum cultures showed yeast, but it is unclear what to make of this, so daily sputum cultures are being continued.

2. COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: The patient was diagnosed with Moraxella infection and treated with levofloxacin dosed renally, now completed course.

3. SHOCK: The patient is persistently hypotensive requiring addition of vasopressin in addition to dopamine yesterday. Dopamine could not be titrated up further yesterday secondary to ectopy. Likely etiology is combination of cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as resolving septic shock (+ blood cultures, CAP). The patient previously on intraaortic balloon pump is now off.

   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with multifactorial shock.
   SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA:
   - On nafcillin for MSSA (monotherapy given TEE Neg endocarditis)
   - Began empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl. Neg todate
   - RUQ showed sludge, no e/o acute chole
   - Will scan abd/pelvis with contrast today.
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures.  Follow micro data.
   - UCx Pending
   - most recent sputum cultures with yeast, however patient on ventilator
   so unclear what to make of this, continue daily sputums
   # COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: ID of moraxella, Treated with
   levofloxacin dosed renally, now completed course.
   # SHOCK: Patient is still persistently hypotensive requiring addition
   of vasopressin in addition to dopamine yesterday. Dopamine could not be
   titrated up furthur yesterday secondary to ectopy. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as
   resolving septic shock (+ blood cultures, CAP). Patient previously on
   intraaortic balloon pump now off.
   - cont pressors for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60
   - Will still try and get fluid off to be able to wean off AC vent
   control; improve forward flow.
   - cont Nafcillin for TEE negative bacteremia, continue empiric
   treatment for c. diff with PO flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient failed pressure support trial yesterday
   with HR increasing as well as BP dropping required additional pressor
   support with vasopressin. Last gas with adequate oxyugenation as well
   as low-normal CO2.  Think that respiratory failure likely from fluid
   overload in the setting of acute systolic heart failure. Yesterday was
   first day that CVVH had been successful in making patient negative.

   # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:
   - continue CVVH for now.  Per renal plan to continue CVVH until UOP
   1000cc/day.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing cardiogenic shock. The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease. He is currently experiencing multifactorial shock, sepsis/bacteremia, community-acquired pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute hepatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, acute kidney injury, rhythm disturbances, diabetes mellitus, anemia, peripheral eosinophilia, hyperlipidemia, and neuropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen due to low cardiac output and acute systolic heart failure.
2. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient may develop further complications from sepsis/bacteremia if the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are not effective.
3. Community-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient may experience worsening respiratory symptoms or develop new complications related to the pneumonia.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if fluid overload is not managed appropriately or if there is inadequate oxygenation.
5. Acute Hepatitis: The patient's acute hepatitis may lead to liver dysfunction and potential complications such as coagulopathy or encephalopathy.

The empyema was believed to be due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib fracture that became superinfected during MSSA bacteremia.

The patient also has community-acquired pneumonia identified as Moraxella, treated with levofloxacin dosed renally, and completed the course. However, the patient is now experiencing ongoing cardiogenic shock and resolving septic shock.

The patient is also dealing with respiratory failure likely from fluid overload and infectious processes, including pneumonia and empyema. The patient has a chest tube in place, and weaning from the ventilator is not currently planned.

Additionally, the patient has acute hepatitis, improving from a maximum of thousands likely from shock liver in the setting of low cardiac output. The patient's liver function tests are being trended.

The patient also has hyperbilirubinemia without evidence of hemolysis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with multifactorial shock.
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Pt developed distributive shock in the context of
   like sepsis. Initially was improving then started to decline again.
   Ultimately found to have empyema.
   - ID following. Recs greatly appreciated.
   - On nafcillin for MSSA (monotherapy given TEE Neg endocarditis)
   - Found to have rising WBC to > 30,000. CT on [**2-14**] showed pulmonary
   effusion. Diagnostic tap showed empyema and thoracics placed a chest
   tube
   - Began empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl given risking WBC.
   Cdiff negative x1. Additional pending. Can likely DC now that we have
   an explanation for elevated WBC
   - RUQ showed sludge, no e/o acute chole
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures.  Follow micro data.
   - UCx Pending
   - most recent sputum cultures with yeast, however patient on ventilator
   so unclear what to make of this, continue daily sputums
   # EMPYEMA: Pt had rising WBC. Pleural effusion was noted to be very
   enlarged on CT on [**2-14**]. Diagnostic tap was consistent with empyema.
   Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube for further drainage. It was felt
   that the empyema was due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib
   fracture that became super infected during his MSSA bacteremia
   - Thoracics following. Recs greatly appreciated
   - ID following. Recs greatly appreciated
   - Final culture ID and [**Last Name (un) 206**]. pending
   - Chest tube to suction -20cm H2O for now
   # COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: ID of moraxella, Treated with
   levofloxacin dosed renally, now completed course.
   # SHOCK: Patient is still persistently hypotensive requiring addition
   of vasopressin in addition to dopamine yesterday. Dopamine could not be
   titrated up furthur yesterday secondary to ectopy. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as
   resolving septic shock (+ blood cultures, CAP). Patient previously on
   intraaortic balloon pump now off.
   - cont pressors for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60
   - Will still try and get fluid off to be able to wean off AC vent
   control; improve forward flow.
   - cont Nafcillin for TEE negative bacteremia, continue empiric
   treatment for c. diff with PO flagyl for now
   - f/u cultures
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient failed pressure support trial yesterday
   with HR increasing as well as BP dropping required additional pressor
   support with vasopressin. Last gas with adequate oxyugenation as well
   as low-normal CO2.  Think that respiratory failure likely from fluid
   overload in the setting of acute systolic heart failure. Yesterday was
   first day that CVVH had been successful in making patient negative.
   - cont to make patient negative goal -1 Liter
   - as patient improves hemodynamically continue pressure support/RISB
   trials
   # ACUTE HEPATITIS: Improving from max of 1000s likely from shock liver
   in the setting of low cardiac output.
   - trend LFTS
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Does not appear to be hemolysis, concern for RUQ
   source of infection given elevated bili. Patient had RUQ yesterday
   which demonstrated no acute pathology some sludging.
   - cont to trend
   # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:
   - continue CVVH for now.  Per renal plan to continue CVVH until UOP
   1000cc/day.
   - follow up daily renal recs
   - Renally dose meds
   # RHYTHM: Ectopy, worse with increased doses of dopamin
   # DM: Switch back to insulin gtt
   # ANEMIA (CKD+Inflammation): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was
   31.6 in [**2186**], and On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly
   below baseline at 29.  Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.
   - Off heparin drip now. SQ only
   - Crit is stable
   - would not transfuse this morning
   # PERIPHERAL EOSINOPHILIA: new today, absolute count 640. will follow,
   consider adrenal insufficiency, fungal process, drug reaction
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk
   management
   # NEUROPATHY, PERIPHERAL: On gabapentin as outpatient, inactive issue,
   holding.
   FEN:  OG tube in place, TFs at goal.  Reglan for h/o gastroparesis.
   ACCESS: PIV's x 3 (20g x 2, 18g x 1), L IJ HD line, R IJ.  Aline in
   place.
   PROPHYLAXIS:  Hep subq, PPI given intubated.  No need for bowel regimen
   as patient with soft stools.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea and vomiting and ongoing chest pain. The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization, now with multifactorial shock.

The patient developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis. He initially improved but then started declining again. It was discovered that the patient had empyema, and a chest tube was placed by thoracic surgery. The patient also has rising white blood cell count, and a diagnostic tap showed empyema. The empyema was due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib fracture that became superinfected during his MSSA bacteremia.

The patient's current conditions include sepsis/bacteremia, community-acquired pneumonia, shock, respiratory failure, acute hepatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, acute kidney injury, rhythm abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, anemia, peripheral eosinophilia, hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient is still hypotensive and requires the addition of vasopressin in addition to dopamine. The combination of cardiogenic shock and resolving septic shock could be contributing to the hypotension. The patient"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Wrote for 1x dose of vanco in addition to nafcillin while awaiting
   final cultures from empyema. Pt did not get addl Levo as ID did not
   recommend. Need to check with pharmacy today re: vanco dosing.
   - In afternoon, MAPs were down in 50s. Pt had increased output
   (200-300/hr) of gross dark blood from chest tube. CVPs also dropped
   from >10 to 5. Thoracics called, said normal as pt was given TPA that
   am to clear clots in tube. Did not recommend surgical intervention, as
   limited options and pt not good surgical candidate. Stat crit showed
   drop from 25.7 in am -> 22.5-> 19.9. Pt received 2 units pRBCs, 1 bag
   plt, 1 bag FFP to decrease bleeding. MAPs improved to 60s after
   interventions. Post-transfusion crit was 22.1, then -> 21.1 on re-check
   two hours after. Gave addl 2 units pRBCs. Re-check crit during end of

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing chest pain. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. He is now experiencing cardiogenic and septic shock, with hypotension requiring vasopressin and dopamine. The patient has been treated for MSSA bacteremia, empyema, community-acquired pneumonia, acute kidney injury, acute hepatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, rhythm disturbances, diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low cardiac output is causing hypotension and inadequate tissue perfusion.
2. Septic shock: The patient has bacteremia and empyema, which are contributing to his hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and empyema are likely causing respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, possibly due to ongoing blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding or chest tube drainage.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to sepsis, hypoperfusion, and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
6. Acute hepatitis: The patient"

   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with multifactorial shock.
   .
   # Cardiogeneic and Septic Shock: Patient is still persistently
   hypotensive requiring addition of vasopressin in addition to dopamine.
   Dopamine requirement decreasing over last 24 hours. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as septic
   shock (bacteremia and empyema) Patient previously on intraaortic
   balloon pump now off.
   - cont pressors for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60
   - cont Nafcillin for TEE negative bacteremia/empyema, Vanc pending
   pleural fluid data
   - f/u cultures
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Pt developed distributive shock in the context of
   like sepsis. Initially was improving then started to decline again.
   Ultimately found to have empyema.
   - ID following. Recs greatly appreciated.
   - On nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (PA line cultures +)
   - Found to have rising WBC to > 30,000. CT on [**2-14**] showed pulmonary
   effusion. Diagnostic tap showed empyema and thoracics placed a chest
   tube
 on vanc/nafcillin pending final culture data
   - Began empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl given risking WBC.
   Cdiff negative x1
 will DC flagyl
   - RUQ showed sludge, no e/o acute chole
   - surveillence cultures negative to date
   # EMPYEMA: Pt had rising WBC. Pleural effusion was noted to be very
   enlarged on CT on [**2-14**]. Diagnostic tap was consistent with empyema.
   Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube for further drainage. It was felt
   that the empyema was due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib
   fracture that became super infected during his MSSA bacteremia
   - Thoracics following. Recs greatly appreciated
   - ID following. Recs greatly appreciated
   - Final culture ID and [**Last Name (un) 206**]. pending
   - Chest tube to suction -20cm H2O for now
   - continue vanc/nafcillin pending culture data
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely from fluid overload and infectious
   process with pneumonia and empyema above. Currently with chest tube
   placed by thorassic surgery.
   - plan to continue on the vent today given new chest tube without plan
   to wean settings
   - consider pressure support trial tomorrow
   - f/u thorassic recs regarding chest tube
   - goal even to -500 cc negative

   # ANEMIA : Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, now with
   decreasing HCT in setting on chest tube placement, also found to have
   guaiac + stools. Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.
   - Off heparin drip now. SQ only

   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with multifactorial shock.
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Pt developed distributive shock in the context of
   like sepsis. Initially was improving then started to decline again.
   Ultimately found to have empyema.
   - ID following. Recs greatly appreciated.
   - restart Levoquin, f/u cultures as per ID
   - On nafcillin for MSSA (monotherapy given TEE Neg endocarditis)
   - Found to have rising WBC to > 30,000. CT on [**2-14**] showed pulmonary
   effusion. Diagnostic tap showed empyema and thoracics placed a chest
   tube
   - Began empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl given risking WBC.
   Cdiff negative x1. Additional pending, continue flagyl until get
   additional negative c. diff
   - RUQ showed sludge, no e/o acute chole
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures.  Follow micro data.
   - most recent sputum cultures with yeast, however patient on ventilator
   so unclear what to make of this, continue daily sputums
   # EMPYEMA: Pt had rising WBC. Pleural effusion was noted to be very
   enlarged on CT on [**2-14**]. Diagnostic tap was consistent with empyema.
   Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube for further drainage. It was felt
   that the empyema was due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib
   fracture that became super infected during his MSSA bacteremia
   - Thoracics following. Recs greatly appreciated
   - ID following. Recs greatly appreciated
   - Final culture ID and [**Last Name (un) 206**]. pending
   - Chest tube to suction -20cm H2O for now
   - restart Levoquin as above
   # COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: ID of moraxella, Treated with
   levofloxacin dosed renally, now completed course however now that
   patient has
   # SHOCK: Patient is still persistently hypotensive requiring addition
   of vasopressin in addition to dopamine yesterday. Dopamine could not be
   titrated up furthur yesterday secondary to ectopy. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as
   resolving septic shock (+ blood cultures, CAP). Patient previously on
   intraaortic balloon pump now off.
   - cont pressors for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60, wean
   as tolerated
   - cont Nafcillin for TEE negative bacteremia, continue empiric
   treatment for c. diff with PO flagyl for now await repeat c. diff
   culture
   - restart levoquin
   - f/u cultures
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely from fluid overload and infectious
   process with pneumonia and empyema above. Currently with chest tube
   placed by thorassic surgery.
   - plan to continue on the vent today given new chest tube without plan
   to wean settings
   - consider pressure support trial tomorrow
   - f/u thorassic recs regarding chest tube
   - goal even to -500 cc negative
   # ACUTE HEPATITIS: Improving from max of 1000s likely from shock liver
   in the setting of low cardiac output.
   - trend LFTS
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Does not appear to be hemolysis, concern for RUQ
   source of infection given elevated bili. Patient had RUQ yesterday
   which demonstrated no acute pathology some sludging.
   - cont to trend
   # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:
   - continue CVVH for now, will discuss plan with renal when to
   discontinue  .
   - Renally dose meds
   # RHYTHM: Ectopy improved with decreased doparmine drip
   # DM: insulin drip for tight glucose control
   # ANEMIA (CKD+Inflammation): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was
   31.6 in [**2186**], and On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly
   below baseline at 29.  Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.
   - Off heparin drip now. SQ only
   - Crit is stable
   # PERIPHERAL EOSINOPHILIA: new today, absolute count 640. will follow,
   consider adrenal insufficiency, fungal process, drug reaction
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk
   management
   # NEUROPATHY, PERIPHERAL: On gabapentin as outpatient, inactive issue,
   holding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea and vomiting and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. He now has multifactorial shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis and bacteremia. Initially, he was improving, but then he started to decline again. He was found to have empyema.
2. Empyema: The patient had a rising white blood cell count and a CT scan showed a pulmonary effusion. A diagnostic tap confirmed empyema, and a chest tube was placed by thoracic surgery. The empyema was likely due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib fracture that became superinfected during his MSSA bacteremia.
3. Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient was treated with levofloxacin for Moraxella pneumonia but completed the course and now has persistent hypotension.
4. Shock: The patient is still persistently hypotensive and requires vasopressin in addition to dopamine. The likely etiology is cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as resolving septic shock.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure due to fluid"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Wrote for 1x dose of vanco in addition to nafcillin while awaiting
   final cultures from empyema. Pt did not get addl Levo as ID did not
   recommend. Need to check with pharmacy today re: vanco dosing.
   - In afternoon, MAPs were down in 50s. Pt had increased output
   (200-300/hr) of gross dark blood from chest tube. CVPs also dropped
   from >10 to 5. Thoracics called, said normal as pt was given TPA that
   am to clear clots in tube. Did not recommend surgical intervention, as
   limited options and pt not good surgical candidate. Stat crit showed
   drop from 25.7 in am -> 22.5-> 19.9. Pt received 2 units pRBCs, 1 bag
   plt, 1 bag FFP to decrease bleeding. MAPs improved to 60s after
   interventions. Post-transfusion crit was 22.1, then -> 21.1 on re-check
   two hours after. Gave addl 2 units pRBCs. Re-check crit during end of

1. Chief Complaint: The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note.

2. 24-Hour Events:
   - The patient received vancomycin and nafcillin for empyema, but did not receive additional Levo due to ID recommendation.
   - The patient experienced a drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s and had increased output of gross dark blood from the chest tube, along with a decrease in central venous pressure (CVP). The patient was given TPA to clear clots in the tube, and surgical intervention was not recommended.
   - The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 1 unit of platelets, and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to decrease bleeding. The patient's MAP improved to the 60s after these interventions.
   - The patient spiked a fever of 101.8 degrees in the early afternoon and was pan-cultured.
   - Additional C. diff was ordered.
   - The patient's tube feedings were changed to Nutren 2.0 with 30 grams of beneprotein at 40 cc/hour.

   final cultures from empyema. Pt did not get addl Levo as ID did not
   recommend. Need to check with pharmacy today re: vanco dosing.
   - In afternoon, MAPs were down in 50s. Pt had increased output
   (200-300/hr) of gross dark blood from chest tube. CVPs also dropped
   from >10 to 5. Thoracics called, said normal as pt was given TPA that
   am to clear clots in tube. Did not recommend surgical intervention, as
   limited options and pt not good surgical candidate. Stat crit showed
   drop from 25.7 in am -> 22.5-> 19.9. Pt received 2 units pRBCs, 1 bag
   plt, 1 bag FFP to decrease bleeding. MAPs improved to 60s after

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac
   catherization now with multifactorial shock.
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Pt developed distributive shock in the context of
   like sepsis. Initially was improving then started to decline again.
   Ultimately found to have empyema.
   - ID following. Recs greatly appreciated.
   - restart Levoquin, f/u cultures as per ID
   - On nafcillin for MSSA (monotherapy given TEE Neg endocarditis)
   - Found to have rising WBC to > 30,000. CT on [**2-14**] showed pulmonary
   effusion. Diagnostic tap showed empyema and thoracics placed a chest
   tube
   - Began empiric treatment for C. diff with PO flagyl given risking WBC.
   Cdiff negative x1. Additional pending, continue flagyl until get
   additional negative c. diff
   - RUQ showed sludge, no e/o acute chole
   - Continue daily surveillance blood cultures.  Follow micro data.
   - most recent sputum cultures with yeast, however patient on ventilator
   so unclear what to make of this, continue daily sputums
   # EMPYEMA: Pt had rising WBC. Pleural effusion was noted to be very
   enlarged on CT on [**2-14**]. Diagnostic tap was consistent with empyema.
   Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube for further drainage. It was felt
   that the empyema was due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib
   fracture that became super infected during his MSSA bacteremia
   - Thoracics following. Recs greatly appreciated
   - ID following. Recs greatly appreciated
   - Final culture ID and [**Last Name (un) 206**]. pending
   - Chest tube to suction -20cm H2O for now
   - restart Levoquin as above
   # COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: ID of moraxella, Treated with
   levofloxacin dosed renally, now completed course however now that
   patient has
   # SHOCK: Patient is still persistently hypotensive requiring addition
   of vasopressin in addition to dopamine yesterday. Dopamine could not be
   titrated up furthur yesterday secondary to ectopy. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as
   resolving septic shock (+ blood cultures, CAP). Patient previously on
   intraaortic balloon pump now off.
   - cont pressors for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60, wean
   as tolerated
   - cont Nafcillin for TEE negative bacteremia, continue empiric
   treatment for c. diff with PO flagyl for now await repeat c. diff
   culture
   - restart levoquin
   - f/u cultures
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely from fluid overload and infectious
   process with pneumonia and empyema above. Currently with chest tube
   placed by thorassic surgery.
   - plan to continue on the vent today given new chest tube without plan
   to wean settings
   - consider pressure support trial tomorrow
   - f/u thorassic recs regarding chest tube
   - goal even to -500 cc negative
   # ACUTE HEPATITIS: Improving from max of 1000s likely from shock liver
   in the setting of low cardiac output.
   - trend LFTS
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Does not appear to be hemolysis, concern for RUQ
   source of infection given elevated bili. Patient had RUQ yesterday
   which demonstrated no acute pathology some sludging.
   - cont to trend
   # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:
   - continue CVVH for now, will discuss plan with renal when to
   discontinue  .
   - Renally dose meds
   # RHYTHM: Ectopy improved with decreased doparmine drip
   # DM: insulin drip for tight glucose control
   # ANEMIA (CKD+Inflammation): Baseline appears to be in low 30s, was
   31.6 in [**2186**], and On procrit and iron as outpatient.  Hct slightly
   below baseline at 29.  Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.
   - Off heparin drip now. SQ only
   - Crit is stable
   # PERIPHERAL EOSINOPHILIA: new today, absolute count 640. will follow,
   consider adrenal insufficiency, fungal process, drug reaction
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk
   management
   # NEUROPATHY, PERIPHERAL: On gabapentin as outpatient, inactive issue,
   holding.
   FEN:  OG tube in place, TFs at goal.  Reglan for h/o gastroparesis.

He presented with nausea and vomiting and ongoing chest pain. The patient was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization, now with multifactorial shock.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient developed distributive shock in the context of like sepsis. Initially, he was improving but then started to decline again. He was found to have empyema. 

2. Empyema: The patient had a rising white blood cell count, and a CT scan showed a large pleural effusion. A diagnostic tap confirmed empyema, and a chest tube was placed by thoracic surgery. It was believed that the empyema was due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib fracture that became superinfected during his MSSA bacteremia.

3. Community Acquired Pneumonia: The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Moraxella. He was treated with levofloxacin dosed renally and completed the course. However, now he has developed additional complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. He now presents with multifactorial shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient developed distributive shock in the context of likely sepsis. He was initially improving but then started to decline again. He was found to have empyema, which is a collection of pus in the pleural space. This can lead to further infection and complications.
2. Empyema: The patient had a rising white blood cell count, and a CT scan showed an enlarged pleural effusion. A diagnostic tap confirmed empyema, and a chest tube was placed for drainage. The empyema is thought to be due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib fracture that became superinfected during his MSSA bacteremia.
3. Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient was previously treated for Moraxella pneumonia with levofloxacin, but now presents with persistent respiratory symptoms.
4. Shock: The patient is still persistently hypotensive requiring additional vasopressin in addition to dopamine. The likely etiology is a combination of cardiogenic shock (low"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Wrote for 1x dose of vanco in addition to nafcillin while awaiting
   final cultures from empyema. Pt did not get addl Levo as ID did not
   recommend. Need to check with pharmacy today re: vanco dosing.
   - In afternoon, MAPs were down in 50s. Pt had increased output
   (200-300/hr) of gross dark blood from chest tube. CVPs also dropped
   from >10 to 5. Thoracics called, said normal as pt was given TPA that
   am to clear clots in tube. Did not recommend surgical intervention, as
   limited options and pt not good surgical candidate. Stat crit showed
   drop from 25.7 in am -> 22.5-> 19.9. Pt received 2 units pRBCs, 1 bag
   plt, 1 bag FFP to decrease bleeding. MAPs improved to 60s after
   interventions. Post-transfusion crit was 22.1, then -> 21.1 on re-check
   two hours after. Gave addl 2 units pRBCs. Re-check crit during end of
   2nd unit [**Unit Number **].4.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes without multivessel disease on cardiac catheterization. The patient developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis and later declined again. He was diagnosed with empyema, pneumonia, and acute kidney injury. The patient's current condition is critical, requiring multiple organ support including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient initially presented with sepsis and bacteremia, which led to distributive shock. Although he received appropriate antibiotic therapy, he continues to decline, indicating a potential ongoing infection or resistant organism.
2. Empyema: The patient has been diagnosed with empyema, which is a collection of infected fluid in the pleural space. This can lead to further respiratory compromise and requires ongoing drainage and antibiotic therapy.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, resulting in AKI. He is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and will require careful management of fluid balance and electrolytes.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes in the setting of likely infected
   hemothorax which converted to empyema now with cardiogenic/septic
   shock.
   .
   # Cardiogeneic and Septic Shock: Patient is still persistently
   hypotensive requiring vasopressin and dopamine. Dopamine requirement
   has been variable over the past 24 hours. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as septic
   shock (bacteremia and empyema) Patient previously on intraaortic
   balloon pump now off.
   - cont pressors for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60
   - treat sepsis/bacteremia as below
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Pt developed distributive shock in the context of
   sepsis. Initially was improving then started to decline again. Found to
   have rising WBC to > 30,000. CT on [**2-14**] showed pulmonary effusion.
   Diagnostic tap showed empyema and thoracics placed a chest tube.
   Initially concern for c. diff infection given rising white count,
   however feel that less likely given that have other souce of infection
   so c. diff treatment d/c. Patient underwent abdominal ultrasound to
   look for intraabdominal source which demonstrated  no sludge, no acute
   cholecystitis.
   - ID following, f/u daily recs
   - On nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (PA line cultures +)
   - previously on vancomycin
   - surveillence cultures negative to date
   .
   # EMPYEMA: Pt had rising WBC. Pleural effusion was noted to be very
   enlarged on CT on [**2-14**]. Diagnostic tap was consistent with empyema.
   Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube for further drainage. It was felt
   that the empyema was due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib
   fracture that became super infected during his MSSA bacteremia. Chest
   tube output drastically declined over the past 24 hours
   - Thoracics following, recs this morning to keep chest tube to suction
   (-20 cm H20 now)
   - ID following. reccomendations have been to continue nafcillin and d/c
   vanco
   - Final culture ID and [**Last Name (un) 206**]. pending
   - continue nafcillin
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely from fluid overload and infectious
   process with pneumonia and empyema above. Currently with chest tube
   placed by thorassic surgery.
   - plan to continue on the vent today given new chest tube without plan
   to wean settings
   - consider pressure support trial tomorrow
   - f/u thorassic recs regarding chest tube
   - goal even to -500 cc negative
   .
   # ANEMIA : Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, now with
   decreasing HCT in setting on chest tube placement, also found to have
   guaiac + stools. Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.
   - Off heparin drip now. SQ only
   - CT TPA
d yesterday due to complicated effusion
 increased bloody
   output
   - Trend HCT q8
 goal HCT >25
   - start pantoprazole IV for guaiac + stool
   .
   # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:
   - continue CVVH for now, will discuss plan with renal when to
   discontinue  .
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: ID of moraxella, Treated with
   levofloxacin dosed renally, now completed course
   .
   # ACUTE HEPATITIS: Improving from max of 1000s likely from shock liver
   in the setting of low cardiac output.
   - trending down
   .
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Does not appear to be hemolysis, concern for RUQ
   source of infection given elevated bili. Patient had RUQ yesterday
   which demonstrated no acute pathology some sludging.
   - cont to trend
   .
   # RHYTHM: Ectopy improved with decreased doparmine drip
   .
   # DM: insulin drip for tight glucose control
   .
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk
   management
   .
   # NEUROPATHY, PERIPHERAL: On gabapentin as outpatient, inactive issue,
   holding.
   .
   # FEN:  OG tube in place, TFs at goal.  Reglan for h/o gastroparesis.
   # ACCESS: PIV's x 3 (20g x 2, 18g x 1), L IJ HD line, R IJ.  Aline in
   place.
    # PROPHYLAXIS:  Hep subq, PPI given intubated.  Bowel regimen.
   # CODE: Full, confirmed with wife [**2-7**] (though pt would not want to be
   maintained on lifelong vent)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presents with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing cardiogenic and septic shock. The patient has elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and EKG changes, suggesting an ongoing infectious process. He was initially on an intraaortic balloon pump but is now off.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient is persistently hypotensive, requiring vasopressin and dopamine. The likely etiology is a combination of cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) and septic shock (bacteremia and empyema). We will continue to use pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Septic workup and treatment will be continued as below.

2. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis. He had a rising white blood cell (WBC) count, and a CT scan on [**2-14**] showed a pulmonary effusion. Diagnostic tap confirmed empyema, and a chest tube was placed by thoracic surgery. Initially, there was concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection due to the rising WBC count, but it is less likely given another source of infection"

   Chief Complaint: shock
   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs: nafcillin 2 gram q 4 hours, stop vancomycin (all cultures
   negative for MSSA)
   - thorassic rec: nothing new (chest x-ray lung looks expanded on chest
   tube side, decreased flow out of chest tube)
   - Renal recs: none left
   - post- transfusion crit 26 after 2 units, wrote for additional unit
   - tried taking patient off vasopressin as was only on low dose of
   dopamine however then patient dropped pressure so placed patient back
   on vasopressin
   - d/c Flagyl as low prob for c. diff
   - no stool
   - chest x-ray: Right upper lobe has re-expanded. Small left pleural
   effusion is probably increasing, despite left pleural drain. Moderate
   cardiomegaly stable. ET tube and nasogastric tube in standard
   placements.

   elevated CE and EKG changes in the setting of likely infected
   hemothorax which converted to empyema now with cardiogenic/septic
   shock.
   .
   # Cardiogeneic and Septic Shock: Patient is still persistently
   hypotensive requiring vasopressin and dopamine. Dopamine requirement
   has been variable over the past 24 hours. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as septic
   shock (bacteremia and empyema) Patient previously on intraaortic
   balloon pump now off.

   enlarged on CT on [**2-14**]. Diagnostic tap was consistent with empyema.
   Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube for further drainage. It was felt
   that the empyema was due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib
   fracture that became super infected during his MSSA bacteremia. Chest
   tube output drastically declined over the past 24 hours

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presents with nausea and vomiting, ongoing cardiogenic and septic shock, and an elevated white blood cell count. The patient has been treated for MSSA bacteremia with nafcillin and had an infected hemothorax that converted to empyema. He also has respiratory failure, anemia, acute kidney injury, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, and gastroparesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low cardiac output and hypotension indicate cardiogenic shock, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
2. Septic shock: The patient's bacteremia, empyema, and rising white blood cell count suggest sepsis, which can progress to septic shock and further compromise organ function.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's declining urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances and require renal replacement therapy.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and decreased respiratory function indicate respiratory failure, which can be caused by fluid overload, pneumonia, and empyema.
5. Anemia: The patient's decreasing hematocrit levels and positive guaiac test indicate"

   Chief Complaint: shock
   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs: nafcillin 2 gram q 4 hours, stop vancomycin (all cultures
   negative for MSSA)
   - thoracic rec: nothing new (chest x-ray lung looks expanded on chest
   tube side, decreased flow out of chest tube)
   - Renal recs: none left
   - post- transfusion crit 26 after 2 units, wrote for additional unit
   - tried taking patient off vasopressin as was only on low dose of
   dopamine however then patient dropped pressure so placed patient back
   on vasopressin
   - d/c Flagyl as low prob for c. diff
   - no stool
   - chest x-ray: Right upper lobe has re-expanded. Small left pleural
   effusion is probably increasing, despite left pleural drain. Moderate

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes in the setting of likely infected
   hemothorax which converted to empyema now with progressively improving
   mixed cardiogenic/septic shock and respiratory failure as well as
   ongoing agitation.
   .
   # Cardiogeneic and Septic SHOCK: Patient is still persistently
   hypotensive requiring vasopressin and dopamine. Dopamine requirement
   has been variable over the past 24 hours. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as septic
   shock (bacteremia and empyema) Patient previously on intraaortic
   balloon pump now off.
   - cont dopamine for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60.
   - treat sepsis/bacteremia as below
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   # SEPSIS: Pt developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis.
   Initially was improving then started to decline again. Likely residual
   empyema causing fever, will f/u with thoracics whether further
   invervention is needed.
   - ID following, f/u daily recs
   - On nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (PA line cultures +).
   - Treat known sources of infection as below (see empyema)
   .
   # EMPYEMA:. Chest tube output remains to decline, ?need to tap
   contralateral side or other pocket
   - Thoracics following, recs appreciated
   - Continue chest tube to suction (-20 cm H20 now).
   - continue nafcillin for MSSA + cultures
   - Has ongoing loculated effusions and blood in the thorax on CT on
   [**2-17**]. [**Month (only) 11**] need additional streptokinase treatment and repositioning of
   the chest tube for now and eventual surgery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely from fluid overload and infectious
   process with pneumonia and empyema above. Currently with chest tube
   placed by thoracic surgery.
   - continue to try to wean sedation. Did well on pressure support for
   several hours yesterday
   - f/u thoracic recs regarding chest tube
   - Transitioning off benzos to haloperidol to reduce agitation and
   respiratory suppression. Weaning off fentayl as tolerated.
   .
   # ANEMIA : Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, now with
   decreasing HCT in setting on chest tube placement, also found to have
   guaiac + stools. Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.
   - Trend HCT [**Hospital1 **]
 goal HCT >26-27
   - active type and cross
   .
   # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:  patient pulled out dialysis line yesterday
   evening. RN discussed with renal, plan to leave patient off of CVVH for
   now and discuss whether or not patient will need additional line
   placed. Patient making good urine especially when MAPs > 70.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Put out >1.5L urine to 80mg Lasix IV x1 yesterday morning
   - Fluid balance even yesterday, will run even today.
   .
   # ECTOPY:  Pt with labile cardiac rhythm. Had several runs of VT
   earlier this admission on high dose dopamine + hyperkalemia. Now on
   lower dose dopamine. Developed ectopy again in the context of K 3.2.
   - Continue to wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively
   - Monitor on tele

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain, and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He is also experiencing cardiogenic and septic shock, with persistent hypotension requiring vasopressin and dopamine. The patient has infected hemothorax that has converted to empyema, and there is a need for additional streptokinase treatment and repositioning of the chest tube. He also has anemia, acute kidney injury, ectopy, and hyperbilirubinemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and requirement for vasopressor support suggest ongoing cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to maintain adequate perfusion and organ function.

2. Septic Shock: The patient's clinical presentation and lab findings indicate a possible septic shock state due to bacteremia and empyema. Prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, along with source control measures such as chest tube management and drainage of empyema.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, as evidenced by ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and pressure support. Weaning off sedation should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes in the setting of likely infected
   hemothorax which converted to empyema now with progressively improving
   mixed cardiogenic/septic shock and respiratory failure as well as
   ongoing agitation.
   .
   # Cardiogeneic and Septic SHOCK: Patient is still persistently
   hypotensive requiring vasopressin and dopamine. Dopamine requirement
   has been variable over the past 24 hours. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as septic
   shock (bacteremia and empyema) Patient previously on intraaortic
   balloon pump now off.
   - cont dopamine for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60.
   - treat sepsis/bacteremia as below
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   # SEPSIS: Pt developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis.
   Initially was improving then started to decline again. Likely residual
   empyema causing fever, will f/u with thoracics whether further
   invervention is needed.
   - ID following, f/u daily recs
   - On nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (PA line cultures +).
   - Treat known sources of infection as below (see empyema)
   .
   # EMPYEMA:. Chest tube output remains to decline, ?need to tap
   contralateral side or other pocket
   - Thoracics following, recs appreciated
   - Continue chest tube to suction (-20 cm H20 now).
   - continue nafcillin for MSSA + cultures
   - Has ongoing loculated effusions and blood in the thorax on CT on
   [**2-17**]. [**Month (only) 11**] need additional streptokinase treatment and repositioning of
   the chest tube for now and eventual surgery.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely from fluid overload and infectious
   process with pneumonia and empyema above. Currently with chest tube
   placed by thoracic surgery.
   - continue to try to wean sedation. Did well on pressure support for
   several hours yesterday
   - f/u thoracic recs regarding chest tube
   - Transitioning off benzos to haloperidol to reduce agitation and
   respiratory suppression. Weaning off fentayl as tolerated.
   .
   # ANEMIA : Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, now with
   decreasing HCT in setting on chest tube placement, also found to have
   guaiac + stools. Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding.
   - Trend HCT [**Hospital1 **]
 goal HCT >26-27
   - active type and cross
   .
   # ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:  patient pulled out dialysis line yesterday
   evening. RN discussed with renal, plan to leave patient off of CVVH for
   now and discuss whether or not patient will need additional line
   placed. Patient making good urine especially when MAPs > 70.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Put out >1.5L urine to 80mg Lasix IV x1 yesterday morning
   - Fluid balance even yesterday, will run even today.
   .
   # ECTOPY:  Pt with labile cardiac rhythm. Had several runs of VT
   earlier this admission on high dose dopamine + hyperkalemia. Now on
   lower dose dopamine. Developed ectopy again in the context of K 3.2.
   - Continue to wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Replete electrolytes aggressively
   - Monitor on tele
   .
   # Shock liver -  now resolved: Improving from max of 1000s likely from
   shock liver in the setting of low cardiac output.
   - trending down
   .
   #  HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA: Does not appear to be hemolysis, initially
   concern for RUQ source of infection given elevated bili but RUQ
   demonstrated no acute pathology some sludging.
   - cont to trend
   .
   # DM: insulin drip for tight glucose control
   .
   # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk
   management
   .
   # NEUROPATHY, PERIPHERAL: On gabapentin as outpatient, inactive issue,
   holding.
   .
   # FEN:  OG tube replaced, pending verification of placement by cxr.,
   TFs at goal.  Reglan for h/o gastroparesis
   - abdominal x-ray to eval for acute pathology
   - Ct scan of abdomen from [**2-14**] demonstrated no acute intraabdominal
   infection without evidence of ileus, if remains constipated would
   consider additional scan to rule out new ileus
   # ACCESS: PIV's x 3 (20g x 2, 18g x 1), R IJ.  Aline in place.  L IJ

    # PROPHYLAXIS:  Hep subq, PPI given intubated.  Bowel regimen.
   # CODE: Full, confirmed with wife [**2-7**] (though pt would not want to be
   maintained on lifelong vent), should consider discussion of code status
   again with wife in the next several days if patient does not improve

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain. The patient has been diagnosed with infected hemothorax which converted to empyema, mixed cardiogenic/septic shock, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient is persistently hypotensive, requiring vasopressin and dopamine. The likely etiology is a combination of cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) and septic shock (bacteremia and empyema). The patient previously had an intraaortic balloon pump but is now off it. The plan is to continue dopamine at a low dose to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

2. Sepsis: The patient developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis. Initially, he was improving but then started to decline again. It is believed that residual empyema is causing fever. The infectious disease team is following up with daily recommendations. The patient is on nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia, and known sources of infection are being treated accordingly.

3. Empyema: The chest tube output remains to decline, and there may be a need to tap the contralateral side or"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes in the setting of likely infected
   hemothorax which converted to empyema now with progressively improving
   mixed cardiogenic/septic shock and respiratory failure as well as
   ongoing agitation.
   .
   # Cardiogeneic and Septic Shock: Patient is still persistently
   hypotensive requiring vasopressin and dopamine. Dopamine requirement
   has been variable over the past 24 hours. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as septic
   shock (bacteremia and empyema) Patient previously on intraaortic
   balloon pump now off. Had been dependent on vasopressin + dopamine.
   Vasopressin discontinued with ongoing dependence on dopamine but
   improving pressor requirements.
   - cont dopamine for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60.
   - treat sepsis/bacteremia as below
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   # SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: Pt developed distributive shock in the context of
   sepsis. Initially was improving then started to decline again. Found to
   have rising WBC to > 30,000. CT on [**2-14**] showed pulmonary effusion.
   Diagnostic tap showed empyema and thoracics placed a chest tube.
   Initially concern for c. diff infection given rising white count,
   however feel that less likely given that have other souce of infection
   so c. diff treatment d/c. Patient underwent abdominal ultrasound to
   look for intraabdominal source which demonstrated  no sludge, no acute
   cholecystitis.
   - ID following, f/u daily recs
   - On nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (PA line cultures +).
   - previously on vancomycin. Now discontinued as all cultures have been
   MSSA
   - surveillence cultures negative to date.  Can discontinue
   - Treat known sources of infection as below (see empyema)
   .
   # EMPYEMA: Pt had rising WBC. Pleural effusion was noted to be very
   enlarged on CT on [**2-14**]. Diagnostic tap was consistent with empyema.
   Thoracic surgery placed a chest tube for further drainage. It was felt
   that the empyema was due to an old hemothorax from a recent rib
   fracture that became super infected during his MSSA bacteremia. Chest
   tube output drastically declined over the past 24 hours
   - Thoracics following, recs appreciated
   - Continue chest tube to suction (-20 cm H20 now).
   - continue nafcillin for MSSA + cultures
   - Has ongoing loculated effusions and blood in the thorax on CT on
   [**2-17**]. [**Month (only) 11**] need additional streptokinase treatment and repositioning of
   the chest tube for now and eventual surgery.

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely from fluid overload and infectious
   process with pneumonia and empyema above. Currently with chest tube
   placed by thoracic surgery.
   - continue to try to wean sedation. Did well on pressure support for
   several hours yesterday
   - f/u thoracic recs regarding chest tube
   - Transitioning off benzos to haloperidol to reduce agitation and
   respiratory suppression. Weaning off fentayl as tolerated.

   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Put out >1.5L urine to 80mg Lasix IV x1 yesterday morning
   - Fluid balance even yesterday
   - Continue diuresis as needed

   # ECTOPY:  Pt with labile cardiac rhythm. Had several runs of VT
   earlier this admission on high dose dopamine + hyperkalemia. Now on
   lower dose dopamine. Developed ectopy again in the context of K 3.2.
   - Continue to wean dopamine as tolerated

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and recent fall. He presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing chest pain. He was found to have elevated creatine kinase (CK) and EKG changes in the setting of likely infected hemothorax which converted to empyema. The patient is now with progressively improving mixed cardiogenic/septic shock and respiratory failure as well as ongoing agitation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient is still persistently hypotensive requiring vasopressin and dopamine. Dopamine requirement has been variable over the past 24 hours. Likely etiology is combination of cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as septic shock (bacteremia and empyema). The patient previously on intraaortic balloon pump is now off. He was dependent on vasopressin + dopamine. Vasopressin was discontinued with ongoing dependence on dopamine but improving pressor requirements.
- Continue dopamine for now, wean as tolerated to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) > 60.
- Treat sepsis/bacteremia as below.
- Consider repeat echo in the future to reassess left ventricular (LV)/right ventricular (RV) function.

2. SEPSIS/BACTEREMIA: The patient developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis"

   - CT chest showed ongoing loculated hemothorax + empyema
   - CT surgery considering additional streptokinase so holding off on
   additional diuresis for now to avoid hypovolemia from hemorrhage
   - Tolerating pressure support
   - DCed vasopressin. Still on dopamine with stable BP and minimal ectopy
   - DCed vanco per ID recs. Continuing nafcillin
   - PM H/H stable at 9/27 s/p
   - On haloperidol for agitation. Decreasing sedation.
   - DCed metoclopromide given started haloperidol
   - Weaning pressors
   - Sent Ulytes. FENa 0.7% and FEUrea 28% consistent with pre-renal
   state.
   - Held off on additional diuresis for the moment given  pre-renal
   state, low FIO2 requirement, and need for Pt to self regulate acid/base
   status to improve chances of successful intubation
   - Restarted metoclopramide [**1-25**] increasing residuals on tube feeds
   - Developed ectopy O/N. K was 3.2 so repleted K + Mg.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing chest pain. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes, likely due to an infected hemothorax that converted to empyema. The patient is still persistently hypotensive and requires vasopressin and dopamine for cardiogenic and septic shock. He is also experiencing respiratory failure due to fluid overload and infectious process. A chest tube has been placed by thoracic surgery.

The patient has ongoing loculated effusions and blood in the thorax on CT scan. Streptokinase treatment and repositioning of the chest tube are being considered. The patient's anemia is worsening, and he has guaiac positive stools, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed. He has acute kidney injury and is being monitored for any changes in urine output. The patient's electrolytes are being repleted as needed. He is also experiencing ectopy, which may be related to hyperkalemia. The patient's liver enzymes are improving from a previous state of shock liver.

The patient is being treated with multiple medications, including antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia, diuretics for fluid management, insulin for tight glucose control, and other medications for various conditions such as hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, and gastrointestinal"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, based on the provided information, the patient appears to be in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

The patient has received Lasix 80mg IV, which resulted in the output of 1.6L of urine. The patient's volume status, pH, and electrolytes are under control, and potassium was replenished after the Lasix dosing.

A CT chest revealed ongoing loculated hemothorax and empyema. The surgical team is considering additional streptokinase, and they are holding off on further diuresis to avoid hypovolemia from hemorrhage.

The patient is tolerating pressure support and has been weaned off vasopressin. They are still on dopamine with stable blood pressure and minimal ectopy. Vancomycin was discontinued per ID recommendations, but nafcillin is being continued.

The patient's mental status is stable, with a PM H/H of 9/27 s/p. Haloperidol has been started for agitation, and sedation is being decreased. Metoclopramide was discontinued due to the initiation of haloperidol.

The patient's FENa is 0.7% and FEUrea is 28%, consistent with a pre-renal state. Additional diuretics are being held off for the moment due to the pre-renal state, low FIO2 requirement, and need for the patient to self-regulate"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, ongoing chest pain (CP), elevated cardiac enzymes (CE), and EKG changes. The patient is also found to have an infected hemothorax that converted into empyema. The patient's condition has been described as mixed cardiogenic and septic shock, with respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low cardiac output may lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, resulting in organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Septic shock: The presence of bacteremia and empyema indicates a severe infection, which can cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and lead to septic shock. This can result in hypotension, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and even death if not promptly managed.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to fluid overload from acute cardiogenic shock and infectious processes such as pneumonia and empyema. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

4. Anemia: The patient's decreasing hematocrit (HCT) suggests ongoing blood loss, possibly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea, vomiting, and ongoing chest pain, and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes. He is likely suffering from infected hemothorax which converted to empyema, mixed cardiogenic/septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, dopamine for blood pressure support, and intubation for respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient is persistently hypotensive requiring dopamine, indicating ongoing shock. It is important to continue the dopamine infusion to maintain adequate blood pressure and consider weaning as tolerated. Treating sepsis/bacteremia and reassessing left ventricular/right ventricular function through echocardiography may also be necessary.
2. Sepsis/Empyema: The patient developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis. It is recommended to continue Nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and follow up with daily ID recs. Consultation with interventional pulmonology regarding placing a pigtail catheter in the loculated effusion on the left side is advised. Thoracic surgery may eventually be needed for decortication.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of pneumonia, anxiety, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, septic shock, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and other medical conditions. She is currently in the ICU and receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient is on a ventilator, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Nosocomial infections: Being in the ICU, the patient is at increased risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or wound infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's pre-existing renal failure, combined with factors like sepsis, nephrotoxic medications, and hypotension, may worsen her kidney function and lead to AKI.
5. Ventricular arrhythmias: Electrolyte imbalances and the patient's underlying medical conditions, including diabetes and sepsis, may predispose her to cardiac complications like arrhythmias.
6. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and impaired skin integrity can lead to pressure ulcers, which can become infected and complicate the patient's overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure
   .
   #. Cardiogeneic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated clinical
   improvement over past 24 hours, tolerated wean off dopamine for several
   hours. CVP 7. Still persistently febrile. Management of volume status
   difficult given low cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - will discontinue dopamine and maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely
   now hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined, continued fevers
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP/Thoracic recommendations
 given decreased
   drainage from chest tube will pursue IR guided drainage of residual
   fluid collection. Pt may require surgical drainage following
   optimization of clinical status.
   .
   #. Fever
 The patient has been persistently febrile however WBC
   trending down s/p initial chest tube drainage of empyema. Most likely
   source of fevers is the known residual complicated effusion. Concern
   raised for distended gall bladder visualized on ultrasound however
   given overall clinical picture, acalculous cholecystitis is far less
   likely cause of fever.
   - will pursue further drainage of effusion as above
   - will obtain formal RUQ US to evaluate gall bladder, hold on eval for
   drainage for now
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. The pt. demonstrated improvement yesterday with good
   toleration of PSV 12/5 for several hours. ABG on these settings
   adequate. S/p bronchoscopy yesterday to evaluate for possible RUL
   collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging.
   - Continue to wean pressure support as tolerated
   - AM RSBI and potential extubation
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Continue lasix with goal even

   # Anemia: Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, now with
   decreasing HCT in setting on chest tube placement, also found to have

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection and acute renal failure (ARF) which is now resolving. The patient's condition is still unstable with persistent hypotension and respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient's cardiac output is still low (EF 10-15%), and there is ongoing infection, which may lead to further hypotension and shock. Volume status management is challenging.
2. Empyema: The patient has an ongoing empyema with decreased drainage from the chest tube. There is a concern for residual fluid collection, and the patient may require surgical drainage after optimization of clinical status.
3. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, and the source is likely the residual complicated effusion. Further drainage of effusion is planned.
4. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially intubated due to acute cardiogenic shock. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is difficult due to poor cardiac output, volume overload, agitation, and tachypnea.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure
   .
   #. Cardiogeneic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated clinical
   improvement over past 24 hours, tolerated wean off dopamine for several
   hours. CVP 7. Still persistently febrile. Management of volume status
   difficult given low cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - will discontinue dopamine and maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely
   now hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined, continued fevers
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP/Thoracic recommendations
 given decreased
   drainage from chest tube will pursue IR guided drainage of residual
   fluid collection. Pt may require surgical drainage following
   optimization of clinical status.
   .
   #. Fever
 The patient has been persistently febrile however WBC
   trending down s/p initial chest tube drainage of empyema. Most likely
   source of fevers is the known residual complicated effusion. Concern
   raised for distended gall bladder visualized on ultrasound however
   given overall clinical picture, acalculous cholecystitis is far less
   likely cause of fever.
   - will pursue further drainage of effusion as above
   - will obtain formal RUQ US to evaluate gall bladder, hold on eval for
   drainage for now
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. The pt. demonstrated improvement yesterday with good
   toleration of PSV 12/5 for several hours. ABG on these settings
   adequate. S/p bronchoscopy yesterday to evaluate for possible RUL
   collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging.
   - Continue to wean pressure support as tolerated
   - AM RSBI and potential extubation
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Continue lasix with goal even

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute renal failure (now off continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient has demonstrated clinical improvement over the past 24 hours, tolerating weaning off dopamine for several hours. However, he remains persistently febrile, and managing his volume status is challenging due to low cardiac output (ejection fraction 10-15%). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 91/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Physical examination findings include opening eyes to commands, being intubated and sedated, intermittent agitation, rhonchorous upper airway sounds, and soft abdomen. Laboratory results show leukocytosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM, hyperlipidemia and recent fall who
   presents with nausea and vomiting and ongoing CP, found to have
   elevated CE and EKG changes in the setting of likely infected
   hemothorax which converted to empyema now with progressively improving
   mixed cardiogenic/septic shock and respiratory failure as well as
   ongoing agitation.
   .
   # Cardiogeneic and Septic SHOCK: Patient is still persistently
   hypotensive requiring vasopressin and dopamine. Dopamine requirement
   has been variable over the past 24 hours. Likely etiology is
   combination or cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) as well as septic
   shock (bacteremia and empyema) Patient previously on intraaortic
   balloon pump now off.
   - cont dopamine for now, wean as tolerated to maintain MAPs > 60.
   - treat sepsis/bacteremia as below
   - consider repeat echo in the future to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   # SEPSIS: Pt developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis.
   Initially was improving then started to decline again. Likely residual
   empyema causing fever, will f/u with thoracics whether further
   invervention is needed.
   - ID following, f/u daily recs
   - On nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia (PA line cultures +).
   - Treat known sources of infection as below (see empyema)
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. He presented with nausea and vomiting and was found to have elevated creatinine levels and EKG changes. He has been diagnosed with infected hemothorax that converted to empyema, mixed cardiogenic/septic shock, respiratory failure, agitation, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient is persistently hypotensive and requires vasopressin and dopamine. There is a combination of cardiogenic shock (low cardiac output) and septic shock (bacteremia and empyema). The patient may continue to require careful monitoring and management of blood pressure and cardiac function.

2. Sepsis: The patient developed distributive shock in the context of sepsis. He initially improved but then started to decline again. Residual empyema is likely causing fever. The patient will need ongoing infection control measures, including antibiotic therapy and further intervention as recommended by the thoracic surgeons.

3. Empyema: Chest tube output remains to decline, and there may be a need to tap the contralateral side or other pocket. The patient will continue to have ongoing loculated effusions and blood in the thorax. Additional streptokinase treatment and repositioning of the chest tube may be necessary, followed by"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure
   .
   #. Cardiogeneic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated clinical
   improvement over past 24 hours, tolerated wean off dopamine for several
   hours. CVP 7. Still persistently febrile. Management of volume status
   difficult given low cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - will discontinue dopamine and maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely
   now hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined, continued fevers
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP/Thoracic recommendations
 given decreased
   drainage from chest tube will pursue IR guided drainage of residual
   fluid collection. Pt may require surgical drainage following
   optimization of clinical status.
   .
   #. Fever
 The patient has been persistently febrile however WBC
   trending down s/p initial chest tube drainage of empyema. Most likely
   source of fevers is the known residual complicated effusion. Concern
   raised for distended gall bladder visualized on ultrasound however
   given overall clinical picture, acalculous cholecystitis is far less
   likely cause of fever.
   - will pursue further drainage of effusion as above
   - will obtain formal RUQ US to evaluate gall bladder, hold on eval for
   drainage for now
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. The pt. demonstrated improvement yesterday with good
   toleration of PSV 12/5 for several hours. ABG on these settings
   adequate. S/p bronchoscopy yesterday to evaluate for possible RUL
   collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging.
   - Continue to wean pressure support as tolerated
   - AM RSBI and potential extubation
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus, admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute renal failure (now off continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) with resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient demonstrated clinical improvement over the past 24 hours, tolerated weaning off dopamine, and maintained blood pressure with fluid boluses. The patient remains persistently febrile, and the management of volume status is challenging due to low cardiac output (ejection fraction 10-15%).

Empyema management includes continuing nafcillin for MSSA, greatly appreciating ID/IP/Thoracic recommendations, pursuing IR-guided drainage of residual fluid collection, and considering surgical drainage following optimization of clinical status.

Fever is likely related to the known residual complicated effusion, and further drainage of the effusion is planned. A formal right upper quadrant ultrasound will be obtained to evaluate the gallbladder, and evaluation for drainage will be held for now.

Hypoxic respiratory failure is attributed to acute cardiogenic shock. The patient has been difficult to wean due to poor cardiac output/volume overload, agitation, and tachypnea during pressure support ventilation trials. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure
   .
   #. Cardiogeneic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated clinical
   improvement over past 24 hours, tolerated wean off dopamine for several
   hours. CVP 7. Still persistently febrile. Management of volume status
   difficult given low cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - Off pressors X 24 hours - maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely now
   hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials, improved this am
   - Pt tolerated SBT trial this am
 was extubated

   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined, s/p CT guided drainage yesterday with ~200cc
   purulent fluid drained, pig-tail placed.afebrile X 24 hours
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP/Thoracic recommendations. Pt may require
   surgical drainage following optimization of clinical status.
   .
   #. Fever
 Afebrile X 24 hours. The patient had been persistently
   febrile however WBC trending down s/p initial chest tube drainage of
   empyema, improved fever curve following CT drainage. Most likely source
   of fevers is the known residual complicated effusion. Concern raised
   for distended gall bladder visualized on ultrasound however given
   overall clinical picture, acalculous cholecystitis is far less likely
   cause of fever.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia post-intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal and complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection. The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI), resolving hypoxic respiratory failure, and an empyema.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Cardiogenic and septic shock: The patient's clinical improvement over the past 24 hours is encouraging, but the management of volume status remains challenging due to low cardiac output. There is a risk of recurrent hypotension and respiratory failure if the underlying infection and cardiac function do not improve.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Although the patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial this morning and was successfully extubated, there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying cardiac function does not improve or if the patient experiences further mucus plugging.

3. Empyema: The patient has an ongoing empyema, which may require surgical drainage following optimization of clinical status. There is a risk of recurrent fever and worsening respiratory symptoms if the empyema is not adequately managed.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Although the patient's AKI is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock from MSSA empyema and line infection, acute renal failure (now off continuous renal replacement therapy), and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient still demonstrates persistently low cardiac output, and the management of volume status remains challenging. The patient may continue to experience hypotension related to ongoing infection and insensible losses.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to acute cardiogenic shock. The patient has been difficult to wean secondary to poor cardiac output, volume overload, agitation, and tachypnea during pressure support ventilation trials. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial this morning and was successfully extubated. However, close monitoring and follow-up ABG in 1 hour are required. The patient should continue lasix with the goal of achieving a net negative fluid balance of 500cc-1L and aggressive pulmonary toilet.

3. Empyema: The patient has a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures after a fall, complicated by superinfection. Chest tube output has declined persistently, and the patient underwent CT-guided drainage yesterday, with approximately 200"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure
   .
   #. Cardiogeneic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated clinical
   improvement over past 24 hours, tolerated wean off dopamine for several
   hours. CVP 7. Still persistently febrile. Management of volume status
   difficult given low cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - will discontinue dopamine and maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely
   now hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined, s/p CT guided drainage yesterday with ~200cc
   purulent fluid drained, pig-tail placed.afebrile X 24 hours
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP/Thoracic recommendations. Pt may require
   surgical drainage following optimization of clinical status.
   .
   #. Fever
 Afebrile X 24 hours. The patient had been persistently
   febrile however WBC trending down s/p initial chest tube drainage of
   empyema, improved fever curve following CT drainage. Most likely source
   of fevers is the known residual complicated effusion. Concern raised
   for distended gall bladder visualized on ultrasound however given
   overall clinical picture, acalculous cholecystitis is far less likely
   cause of fever.
   - management of empyema as above
   - RUQ US with no evidence of cholecystitis
 no indication for drainage
   at this time
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. The pt. demonstrated improvement yesterday with good
   toleration of PSV 12/5 for several hours. ABG on these settings
   adequate. S/p bronchoscopy yesterday to evaluate for possible RUL
   collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging.
   - Continue to wean pressure support as tolerated
   - AM RSBI and potential extubation
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Continue lasix with goal even

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient has shown improvement over the past 24 hours, tolerating the weaning off dopamine. However, persistent hypotension and respiratory failure are still present. The management of volume status is challenging due to low cardiac output (ejection fraction 10-15%). The patient's blood pressure may be related to ongoing infection and insensible losses.

2. Empyema: The patient had an initial hemothorax secondary to rib fractures after a fall, complicated by superinfection. Chest tube output has declined, and a CT-guided drainage was performed yesterday, draining approximately 200cc of purulent fluid. A pigtail catheter was placed. The patient may require surgical drainage following optimization of their clinical status.

3. Fever: The patient has been afebrile for 24 hours. Previously, they had persistent fevers, which improved following CT drainage of the empyema. The most likely source of fevers is the residual complicated effusion.

4. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated due to acute cardiogenic shock. They have been difficult to wean due to poor cardiac output, volume overload, agitation, and tachypnea during pressure support ventilation trials.

   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. Now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
   Ongoing agitation and tachypnea.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after the removal of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection and acute renal failure (ARF), which is now resolving.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF)/valvular heart disease, empyema, agitation and mental status changes, acute kidney injury (ATN), cardiogenic and septic shock, anemia, hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, and gastroparesis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 113 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 82/50 mmHg to 129/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. His central venous pressure (CVP) is at 8 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, sodium of 147 mEq/L, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL, glucose of 211 mg/dL, and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 33 mg/dL.

The patient's ongoing medical concerns include hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic CHF/valvular heart disease, empyema, agitation and mental status changes, ATN, cardiogenic and septic shock, anemia, hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, and gastroparesis.

The patient's treatment plan includes extubation and continued monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation. He is receiving nebulized bronchodilators (nebs) every 4 hours. Lasix 80mg IV was administered, and the patient received a 500mL bolus due to negative fluid balance. The patient's arterial blood gases (ABGs) are acceptable. A pigtail catheter was placed, and the chest tube output has declined. Nafcillin was started for MSSA infection, and the patient may require surgical drainage. Lorazepam is being used for agitation and possible benzodiazepine (BZ) withdrawal. Morphine sulfate is being considered for pain and symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Renal dosing of medications and repletion of electrolytes as needed are planned. The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and consideration is being given"

Summary:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, admitted for cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal.
- Course complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (now off continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), and agitation.
- Currently extubated and tolerating it moderately well, with ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
- The patient has an ejection fraction of 10-15%, moderate aortic stenosis, and significant mitral regurgitation.
- Empyema is present, with ongoing drainage and pigtail placement.
- Agitation and mental status changes are likely multifactorial, related to prolonged hospitalization and long-term use of benzodiazepines and opioids.
- Acute kidney injury has resolved, and the patient is now dependent on maintaining a minimum of 500 mL output per day.
- Cardiogenic and septic shock have demonstrated clinical improvement, but ongoing septic process persists with falling white blood cell count.
- Management of volume status is challenging due to low cardiac output.
- Anemia is present, likely due to chronic disease and"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. Now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
   Ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
   - ABGs stable
   - Settled with ativan
 possible that this is a component of BZ
   withdrawal
   - Diurese as above
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined, s/p CT guided drainage yesterday with ~200cc
   purulent fluid drained, pig-tail placed.afebrile X 24 hours
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP/Thoracic recommendations. Pt may require
   surgical drainage following optimization of clinical status.
   - Pt self DCed Pleurex, which fortunately was not draining at this
   point
   - Continue chest tube
   .
   # Agitation and mental status: Pt agitated and acutely delirious.
   Likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization and longterm
   use of BZs and opiates.
   - Continue PRN lorazepam for agitation / BZ withdrawal as was dependent
   on midazolam for >2 weeks
   - Consider PRN morphine IV for pain and s/s opiate W/D
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH. Has responded well to Lasix 80mg IV so far. UOP is dependent on
   MAPs.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Plan today to keep even to -500mL
   - Consider pressors for MAPs persistently <50
   .
   #. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated clinical
   improvement. Still an ongoing septic process but WBC falling. Ongoing
   empyema. Management of volume status difficult given low cardiac output
   (EF 10-15%).
   - Off pressors >24 hours - maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely now
   hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   - BP is borderline and renal function seems dependent on MAPs.
   Considering re-starting pressors but holding off for now
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, now with
   decreasing HCT in setting on chest tube placement, also found to have
   guaiac + stools. Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding. HCT
   stable
   - Trend HCT [**Hospital1 **]
 goal HCT >26-27
   - active type and cross
   .
   # Shock liver -  now resolved:
   .
   # DM:  DC insulin gtt and start lantus + SSI

   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk
   management

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute kidney injury (now off continuous renal replacement therapy), and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.

2. The patient initially required intubation due to acute cardiogenic shock and had a right upper lobe (RUL) collapse, which was likely secondary to intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to poor cardiac output/volume overload, agitation, and tachypnea during pressure support ventilation (PSV) trials. The patient has now been successfully extubated and is tolerating it moderately well, with ongoing agitation and tachypnea.

3. The patient has an empyema, initially felt to be a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures from a fall, complicated by superinfection. Chest tube output has persistently declined, and yesterday, a computed tomography (CT)-guided drainage procedure was performed, draining approximately 200cc of purulent fluid. A pigtail catheter has been placed. The patient remains a"

   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. Now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
   Ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
   - ABGs stable despite tachypnea
   - Settled with ativan
 possible that this is a component of BZ
   withdrawal

   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined, s/p CT guided drainage yesterday with ~200cc
   purulent fluid drained, pig-tail placed.afebrile X 24 hours

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. 

The patient initially required intubation due to acute cardiogenic shock and was difficult to wean secondary to poor cardiac output/volume overload, agitation, and tachypnea during pressure support ventilation trials. He was extubated successfully and tolerating it moderately well, but still experiencing ongoing agitation and tachypnea.

The patient has an ongoing empyema, which is being managed with nafcillin and may require surgical drainage following optimization of clinical status. He is also at risk for rebleeding due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and guaiac-positive stools. 

The patient's renal function is improving, but he remains dependent on fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure. The management of volume status is challenging given the low ejection fraction (EF 10-15%). 

Other issues include agitation and mental status changes, likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization and long-term use of benzodiazepines and opiates. 

Potential Medical Complications:

   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. Now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
   Ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
   - ABGs stable despite tachypnea
   - Settled with ativan
 possible that this is a component of BZ
   withdrawal
   .
   #. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The pt has an EF of
   [**10-7**]%, Moderate AS AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ MR
   - Currently no BP room to add afterload reducing agents, given overall
   hemodynamics will try to optimize CO with diuresis
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined, s/p CT guided drainage yesterday with ~200cc
   purulent fluid drained, pig-tail placed.afebrile X 24 hours
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA

   # Agitation and mental status: Pt agitated and acutely delirious.
   Likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization and longterm
   use of BZs and opiates.
   - Continue PRN lorazepam for agitation / BZ withdrawal as was dependent
   on midazolam for >2 weeks
   - Consider PRN morphine IV for pain and s/s opiate W/D

   - Plan today to keep even to -500mL
   - Consider pressors for MAPs persistently <50
   .
   . #. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated
   clinical improvement. Still an ongoing septic process but WBC falling.
   Ongoing empyema. Management of volume status difficult given low
   cardiac output (EF 10-15%).

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after the removal of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute kidney injury (now off continuous renal replacement therapy), and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic congestive heart failure/valvular heart disease, empyema, agitation and mental status changes, acute kidney injury, cardiogenic and septic shock, anemia, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to acute cardiogenic shock. Now that he is extubated, ongoing agitation and tachypnea may indicate difficulty tolerating extubation.
2. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The patient has a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (10-15%) and moderate aortic stenosis with severe mitral regurgitation. Optimizing cardiac output and managing volume overload will be essential.
3. Empyema: The patient has an ongoing empyema that requires further management, including drainage and antibiotic therapy.
4. Agitation"

   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Patient noted to be increaseing hypernatremic(150 this
   am), in setting of diureses, free water deficit ~4L.
   -start D5W at 85cc/hr for 2L
   -f/u q6 hour sodium
   -20mg IV lasix once
   -follow I/O to run even
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. Now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
   Ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
   - ABGs stable despite tachypnea
   - Settled with ativan
 possible that this is a component of BZ
   withdrawal
   .
   #. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The pt has an EF of
   [**10-7**]%, Moderate AS AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ MR
   - Currently no BP room to add afterload reducing agents, given overall
   hemodynamics will try to optimize CO with diuresis
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined.afebrile X 24 hours
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP. Pt may require surgical drainage following
   optimization of clinical status.
   - Pt self DCed Pleurex, minimal drainage yesterday
   - Continue chest tube, f/u thoracic recs per position of tube and
   reimaging.
   .
   # Agitation and mental status: Pt agitated and acutely delirious.
   Likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization and longterm
   use of BZs and opiates.
   - Continue PRN lorazepam for agitation / BZ withdrawal as was dependent
   on midazolam for >2 weeks
   - Consider PRN morphine IV for pain and s/s opiate W/D
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH. Has responded well to Lasix 80mg IV so far. UOP is dependent on
   MAPs.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Plan today to keep even to -500mL
   - Consider pressors for MAPs persistently <50
   .
   . #. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated
   clinical improvement. Still an ongoing septic process but WBC falling.
   Ongoing empyema. Management of volume status difficult given low
   cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - Off pressors >24 hours - maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely now
   hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   - BP is borderline and renal function seems dependent on MAPs.
   Considering re-starting pressors but holding off for now
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, now with
   decreasing HCT in setting on chest tube placement, also found to have
   guaiac + stools. Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding. HCT
   stable
   - Trend HCT [**Hospital1 **]
 goal HCT >26-27
   - active type and cross
   .
   # Shock liver -  now resolved:
   .
   # DM:  DC insulin gtt and start lantus + SSI
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk
   management
   .
   # NEUROPATHY, PERIPHERAL: On gabapentin as outpatient, inactive issue,
   holding.
   .
   # FEN:  Reglan for h/o gastroparesis

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia following intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute kidney injury (now off continuous renal replacement therapy), resolving hypotension and respiratory failure, and hypoxic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient is increasing hypernatremic with a free water deficit of approximately 4L. A plan has been started to administer D5W at 85cc/hr for 2L to address this.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to acute cardiogenic shock and has been difficult to wean secondary to poor cardiac output, volume overload, agitation, and tachypnea during pressure support ventilation trials. The patient is now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
3. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The patient has a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (10-15%) and moderate aortic stenosis with 3+ mitral regurgitation.
4. Empyema: The patient has a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures from a fall, complicated by superinfection. Chest"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. Now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
   Ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
   - ABGs stable despite tachypnea
   - Settled with ativan
 possible that this is a component of BZ
   withdrawal
   .
   #. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The pt has an EF of
   [**10-7**]%, Moderate AS AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ MR
   - Currently no BP room to add afterload reducing agents, given overall
   hemodynamics will try to optimize CO with diuresis
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined, s/p CT guided drainage yesterday with ~200cc
   purulent fluid drained, pig-tail placed.afebrile X 24 hours
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP/Thoracic recommendations. Pt may require
   surgical drainage following optimization of clinical status.
   - Pt self DCed Pleurex, minimal drainage yesterday
   - Continue chest tube
   .
   # Agitation and mental status: Pt agitated and acutely delirious.
   Likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization and longterm
   use of BZs and opiates.
   - Continue PRN lorazepam for agitation / BZ withdrawal as was dependent
   on midazolam for >2 weeks
   - Consider PRN morphine IV for pain and s/s opiate W/D
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH. Has responded well to Lasix 80mg IV so far. UOP is dependent on
   MAPs.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Plan today to keep even to -500mL
   - Consider pressors for MAPs persistently <50
   .
   . #. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated
   clinical improvement. Still an ongoing septic process but WBC falling.
   Ongoing empyema. Management of volume status difficult given low
   cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - Off pressors >24 hours - maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely now
   hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   - BP is borderline and renal function seems dependent on MAPs.
   Considering re-starting pressors but holding off for now
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, now with
   decreasing HCT in setting on chest tube placement, also found to have
   guaiac + stools. Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding. HCT
   stable
   - Trend HCT [**Hospital1 **]

   # DM:  DC insulin gtt and start lantus + SSI
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: On vytorin at home. Stopped statin given
   transaminitis.
   - consider restarting once improves clinically for long-term risk
   management

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted due to cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute respiratory failure, acute systolic congestive heart failure/valvular heart disease, and acute kidney injury.
- The patient initially required intubation due to acute cardiogenic shock and was later extubated but experienced ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
- A bronchoscopy was performed to evaluate for possible right upper lobe collapse, which was not visualized. The collapse is likely secondary to intermittent mucus plugging.
- The patient's blood pressure and respiratory function have been stable despite the tachypnea.
- The patient has moderate aortic stenosis and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
- Empyema was diagnosed, and the patient underwent chest tube drainage yesterday with drainage of approximately 200cc of purulent fluid. A pig-tail catheter was placed.
- The patient's mental status is agitated and delirious, likely due to prolonged hospitalization and long-term use of benzodiazepines and opiates.
- The patient has acute kidney injury due to hypotension, which is"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia following the removal of an intra-aortic balloon pump, and his course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute renal failure (ARF), and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient is increasing hypernatremic with a free water deficit of approximately 4L. Hydration should be managed carefully to avoid further electrolyte imbalances. The patient should be started on D5W at 85 cc/hr for 2L, and his sodium levels should be monitored every 6 hours. Lasix 20mg IV should be given once, and his intake/output should be followed closely.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to acute cardiogenic shock but has been extubated and is tolerating it moderately well. He continues to experience agitation and tachypnea, but his ABGs remain stable. Ativan may be helpful for managing his agitation, and it is possible that this is a component of benzodiazepine withdrawal.
3. Acute Systolic CHF/"

   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Patient noted to be increaseing hypernatremic(150 this
   am), in setting of diureses, free water deficit ~4L.
   -start D5W at 85cc/hr for 2L
   -f/u q6 hour sodium
   -20mg IV lasix once
   -follow I/O to run even
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. Now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
   Ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
   - ABGs stable despite tachypnea
   - Settled with ativan
 possible that this is a component of BZ
   withdrawal
   .
   #. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The pt has an EF of
   [**10-7**]%, Moderate AS AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ MR
   - Currently no BP room to add afterload reducing agents, given overall
   hemodynamics will try to optimize CO with diuresis
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined.afebrile X 24 hours
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP. Pt may require surgical drainage following
   optimization of clinical status.
   - Pt self DCed Pleurex, minimal drainage yesterday
   - Continue chest tube, f/u thoracic recs per position of tube and
   reimaging.
   .
   # Agitation and mental status: Pt agitated and acutely delirious.
   Likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization and longterm
   use of BZs and opiates.
   - Continue PRN lorazepam for agitation / BZ withdrawal as was dependent
   on midazolam for >2 weeks
   - Consider PRN morphine IV for pain and s/s opiate W/D
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH. Has responded well to Lasix 80mg IV so far. UOP is dependent on
   MAPs.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Plan today to keep even to -500mL
   - Consider pressors for MAPs persistently <50
   .
   . #. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated
   clinical improvement. Still an ongoing septic process but WBC falling.
   Ongoing empyema. Management of volume status difficult given low
   cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - Off pressors >24 hours - maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely now
   hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   - BP is borderline and renal function seems dependent on MAPs.
   Considering re-starting pressors but holding off for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute systolic congestive heart failure/valvular heart disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient is increasing hypernatremic (150 this am) in the setting of diuresis, with a free water deficit of approximately 4L. This indicates a risk for further electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Although the patient has been extubated and tolerating it moderately well, ongoing agitation and tachypnea may indicate a risk for recurrent respiratory failure.
3. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: With an ejection fraction (EF) of 10-15% and moderate aortic stenosis and severe mitral regurgitation, the patient is at risk for worsening heart failure symptoms and complications.
4. Empyema: The patient's chest tube output persists, indicating ongoing infection and the need for continued treatment. There is a risk of further complications, such as"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute renal failure (ARF), and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical problems include ventricular tachycardia (VT), hypernatremia, hypoxia/pulmonary edema, acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with aortic stenosis (AS), empyema, agitation and mental status changes, acute kidney injury (ATN), anemia, and shock liver.

The patient is being treated with amiodarone for VT, intravenous fluids and diuretics for hypernatremia and pulmonary edema, chest tube placement for empyema, lorazepam for agitation, renal dosing of medications for ATN, blood transfusions for anemia, and discontinuation of gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly worsening creatinine level, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's vital signs include tachycardia, low blood pressure,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic CHF/valvular heart disease, and agitation with mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient had multiple episodes of VT overnight. Close monitoring of potassium and magnesium levels is advised, and amiodarone should be continued.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient is increasing hypernatremic, with a free water deficit of approximately 4L. Administration of D5W at 85cc/hr for 2L should be started, along with follow-up q6 hour sodium levels.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to acute cardiogenic shock and has been difficult to wean secondary to poor cardiac output/volume overload, agitation, and tachypnea during pressure support ventilation trials. Now extubated, ongoing agitation and tachypnea are observed. ABGs remain stable despite tachypnea.

4. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The patient has an ejection fraction of 10-15%,"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. His course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient has multiple ongoing issues that need to be addressed:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient had several runs of VT overnight, and amiodarone was started after a 150mg load.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels improved with D5W and Lasix.
3. Hypoxia/Pulmonary Edema: The patient remains tachypneic, and diuresis with Lasix is ongoing. BIPAP has been initiated to temporize.
4. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)/Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7%, moderate AS with an aortic valve area of 1.0-1.2cm2, and severe mitral regurgitation (3+ MR).
5. Empyema: The patient had an initial hemothorax secondary to rib fractures after a fall, complicated by superin"

   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. Now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
   Ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
   - ABGs stable despite tachypnea
   - Settled with ativan
 possible that this is a component of BZ
   withdrawal

   #. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The pt has an EF of
   [**10-7**]%, Moderate AS AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ MR
   - Currently no BP room to add afterload reducing agents, given overall
   hemodynamics will try to optimize CO with diuresis
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined.afebrile X 24 hours
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP. Pt may require surgical drainage following
   optimization of clinical status.
   - Pt self DCed Pleurex, minimal drainage yesterday
   - Continue chest tube, f/u thoracic recs per position of tube and
   reimaging.
   .
   # Agitation and mental status: Pt agitated and acutely delirious.
   Likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization and longterm
   use of BZs and opiates.
   - Continue PRN lorazepam for agitation / BZ withdrawal as was dependent
   on midazolam for >2 weeks
   - Consider PRN morphine IV for pain and s/s opiate W/D
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH. Has responded well to Lasix 80mg IV so far. UOP is dependent on
   MAPs.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Plan today to keep even to -500mL
   - Consider pressors for MAPs persistently <50
   .
   . #. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated
   clinical improvement. Still an ongoing septic process but WBC falling.
   Ongoing empyema. Management of volume status difficult given low
   cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - Off pressors >24 hours - maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely now
   hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   - BP is borderline and renal function seems dependent on MAPs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia following intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, sustained ventricular tachycardia, hypernatremia, agitation and mental status changes, acute systolic congestive heart failure/valvular heart disease, and anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sustained ventricular tachycardia: The patient has had multiple episodes of VT overnight. This condition can potentially progress to more severe arrhythmias, leading to hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient is increasing hypernatremic, with a sodium level of 150. If left untreated, hypernatremia can lead to neurological complications such as seizures, confusion, and coma.

3. Acute systolic congestive heart failure/valvular heart disease: The patient has an ejection fraction of 10-15% and moderate aortic stenosis and severe mitral regurgitation. These valvular abnormalities can contribute to ongoing heart failure symptoms and impaired cardiac output.

4. Empyema: The patient has an ongoing empyema, which"

   67 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p MI, DM admitted with cardiogenic shock
   secondary to global ischemia s/p IABP removal, course complicated by
   septic shock from MSSA empyema/line infection, ARF (now off CVVH) with
   resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypernatremia: Patient noted to be increaseing hypernatremic(150 this
   am), in setting of diureses, free water deficit ~4L.
   -start D5W at 85cc/hr for 2L
   -f/u q6 hour sodium
   -20mg IV lasix once
   -follow I/O to run even
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt initially intubated secondary to
   acute cardiogenic shock. S/p bronchoscopy [**2-18**] to evaluate for possible
   RUL collapse which was not visualized. Collapse likely secondary to
   intermittent mucus plugging. He has been difficult to wean secondary to
   poor cardiac output/volume overload, also with agitation and tachypnea
   during PSV trials. Now extubated and tolerating it moderately well.
   Ongoing agitation and tachypnea.
   - ABGs stable despite tachypnea
   - Settled with ativan
 possible that this is a component of BZ
   withdrawal
   .
   #. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The pt has an EF of
   [**10-7**]%, Moderate AS AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ MR
   - Currently no BP room to add afterload reducing agents, given overall
   hemodynamics will try to optimize CO with diuresis
   .
   #. Empyema:  Pt felt to have initial hemothorax secondary to rib
   fractures s/p fall, complicated by superinfection.  Chest tube output
   persistently declined.afebrile X 24 hours
   - cont Nafcillin for MSSA
   - Greatly appreciate ID/IP. Pt may require surgical drainage following
   optimization of clinical status.
   - Pt self DCed Pleurex, minimal drainage yesterday
   - Continue chest tube, f/u thoracic recs per position of tube and
   reimaging.
   .
   # Agitation and mental status: Pt agitated and acutely delirious.
   Likely multifactorial related to prolonged hospitalization and longterm
   use of BZs and opiates.
   - Continue PRN lorazepam for agitation / BZ withdrawal as was dependent
   on midazolam for >2 weeks
   - Consider PRN morphine IV for pain and s/s opiate W/D
   .
   # Acute Kidney Injury: ATN secondary to hypotension, now resolving, off
   CVVH. Has responded well to Lasix 80mg IV so far. UOP is dependent on
   MAPs.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes PRN.
   - Plan today to keep even to -500mL
   - Consider pressors for MAPs persistently <50
   .
   . #. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated
   clinical improvement. Still an ongoing septic process but WBC falling.
   Ongoing empyema. Management of volume status difficult given low
   cardiac output (EF 10-15%).
   - Off pressors >24 hours - maintain BP with fluid boluses (likely now
   hypotension related to ongoing infection, insensible losses
   - empyema management as below
   - repeat TTE to reassess LV/RV function
   - BP is borderline and renal function seems dependent on MAPs.
   Considering re-starting pressors but holding off for now
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with underlying anemia of chronic disease, now with
   decreasing HCT in setting on chest tube placement, also found to have
   guaiac + stools. Has a h/o recent GIB is at risk for rebleeding. HCT
   stable
   - Trend HCT [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, currently admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and agitation with altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient is noted to be increasingly hypernatremic (150 this am), likely due to diuresis and free water deficit of approximately 4L. Immediate management includes starting D5W at 85cc/hr for 2L, following I/O closely, and monitoring sodium every 6 hours.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to acute cardiogenic shock and was found to have a right upper lobe collapse, likely secondary to intermittent mucus plugging. Despite being extubated, the patient continues to experience ongoing agitation and tachypnea, although ABGs remain stable.

3. Acute Systolic CHF/Valvular Heart Disease: The patient has a severely reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 10-15% and moderate aortic stenosis with an area of 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ mitral regurgitation. Due to overall hemodynamics, there is no room to add afterload-reducing agents, and optimization of cardiac output will be attempted with diuresis.

4. Empyema: The patient initially had a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures after a fall, complicated by superinfection. Chest tube output has persistently declined, and the patient is now considered to have an empyema. Controlling the infection with appropriate antibiotics (Nafcillin for MSSA) is crucial, and the patient may require surgical drainage once optimized clinically.

5. Agitation and Mental Status: The patient is agitated and acutely delirious, likely due to prolonged hospitalization and long-term use of benzodiazepines (BZs) and opiates. Management includes continuing PRN lorazepam for agitation/BZ withdrawal and considering PRN morphine IV for pain and signs of opiate withdrawal.

6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension but is now resolving, with CVVH being discontinued. The patient has responded well to IV Lasix 80mg so far, and UOP is dependent on MAPs. Renal dosing of medications, repletion of electrolytes, and careful management of fluid balance are necessary.

7. Cardiogenic and Septic Shock: The patient has demonstrated clinical improvement, with ongoing septic process but falling WBC. O"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia following intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's current medical complications include ventricular tachycardia, hypernatremia, hypoxia/pulmonary edema, acute systolic heart failure (ASH) leading to cardiogenic shock, empyema, agitation and altered mental status, acute kidney injury, anemia, shock liver, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of kidney function, further deterioration of heart function, development of new infections, worsening of respiratory status, and potential bleeding events due to the history of gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing use of anticoagulant therapy.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies to assess the progression of these complications and provide appropriate interventions as needed."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and other comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU for cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia following intra-aortic balloon pump removal. His course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient has shown improvement in resolving hypotension and respiratory failure. He is now off continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is transitioning off of intravenous fluids to oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient is being treated with amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are being managed with free water administration and diuretics to remove solute.
3. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure (ASHF)/Acute Systolic Leading to Shock (ASLTS): The patient has a low ejection fraction (<10%), moderate aortic regurgitation, and significant mitral regurgitation. Ongoing diuresis with lasix is being implemented, and diuril 500mg IV bolus will be added.
4. Empyema: The patient"

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, and pneumonia. He is currently on BiPap, amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia, and nafcillin for infection. The patient's sodium levels continue to improve, but his lactate level is elevated at 2.7. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 84/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving IV fluids and diuretics for fluid management. He is also receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, skin assessment not done, and neurologic assessment not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has elevated liver enzymes. Radiology images are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF)/acute systolic (AS) leading to shock: The patient has a low ejection fraction (<10%), moderate aortic stenosis (AS), and significant mitral regurgitation (MR). Ongoing diuresis with lasix is recommended, along with consideration for additional diuretic use if urine output drops. BIPAP overnight is advised, and the patient may require discussion with an outpatient cardiologist.

2. Empyema: The patient initially had a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures after a fall, which later became infected. Chest tube output has persistently declined. Nafcillin therapy for MSSA is recommended, and a non-contrast CT scan today should be done to evaluate the interval change in loculations. Surgical intervention may be required if incomplete drainage is observed.

3. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced episodes of VT, but transition off of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute kidney injury (now off continuous renal replacement therapy), resolving hypotension, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Heart Failure/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a low ejection fraction, moderate aortic stenosis, and significant mitral regurgitation. He is currently on diuretics, bipap support, and being considered for additional diuretics if urine output decreases. Surgical candidacy is currently not possible due to the presence of empyema.
2. Empyema: The patient initially had a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures from a fall, which then became complicated by a superinfection. Chest tube output has been persistently declining. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) is recommended to evaluate interval changes in loculations, and surgical intervention may be required if incomplete drainage is observed.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, for which amiodarone loading was initiated. No further episodes have been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute renal failure (ARF), and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient is currently off continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and is being treated for ventricular tachycardia, hypernatremia, acute systolic heart failure (ASHF), and empyema. The patient also has agitation and mental status changes, acute kidney injury (ATN), anemia, shock liver (resolved), diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy (inactive issue), gastroparesis, and gastrointestinal bleeding history. Prophylaxis measures include hepatitis, stress ulcer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and bowel regimen. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the CCU (Cardiac Care Unit).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient is currently being treated for ventricular tachycardia. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and provide appropriate antiarrhythmic medication as needed.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is an electrolyte imbalance characterized by high sodium levels in the blood. This can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not managed properly.
3. Acute Systolic Heart Failure (ASHF): The patient is experiencing ASHF, which can lead to worsening cardiac function and fluid overload. Close monitoring of the patient's heart function and fluid balance is necessary.
4. Empyema: The patient has an empyema, which is an infection within the pleural space. This can worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient has ATN, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate fluid management are essential.
6. Agitation and Mental Status Changes: The patient is experiencing agitation and acute delirium. This can be caused by various factors such as medication effects, electrolyte imbalances, or infections. It is important to assess and manage the underlying cause while providing supportive care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (ATN).

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), and furosemide (Lasix). He is also receiving nafcillin for MSSA infection, and his blood glucose levels are being managed with Lantus and short-acting insulin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart rate: 98 bpm (87-117 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 111/64 mmHg (82-119/51-95 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 39 breaths per minute (21-45 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM).
- He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal.
- His course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (ARF).
- The patient has multiple comorbidities, including moderate aortic stenosis (AS) and three-vessel coronary artery disease, making him not a surgical candidate at this time.
- He is currently on mechanical ventilation and non-invasive ventilation support.
- The patient has undergone several procedures, including chest tube placement, continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
- His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine (Cr), lactate, and C-reactive protein (CRP), while others, such as hemoglobin (Hb), platelets (Plt), and sodium (Na+), are within normal ranges.

He developed septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Acute systolic heart failure (ASHF) with an ejection fraction of 10-7% and moderate aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ mitral regurgitation. He is on diuretics and bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU for cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Heart Failure/Asymptomatic: The patient has a low ejection fraction of 10-7%, moderate aortic stenosis, and significant mitral regurgitation. He is on diuretics and requires ongoing assessment due to his critical condition.

2. Empyema: The patient initially had a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures from a fall, which later developed into an empyema. He is currently being treated with nafcillin for MSSA and chest tube output is declining.

3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia but has not had any further episodes since starting amiodarone.

4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury with stable creatinine levels. Medications are being renally dosed, and urine output is being monitored for signs of improvement.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were elevated due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, admitted for cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. He developed septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and acute systolic congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF). The patient also has moderate aortic stenosis and multivessel coronary artery disease, making him a non-surgical candidate at this time. Other conditions include empyema, hypernatremia, agitation and altered mental status, anemia, shock liver (resolved), diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic CHF/AS leading to shock: The patient's low EF and moderate AS with significant mitral regurgitation may lead to recurrent episodes of acute systolic CHF and shock.
2. Empyema: The presence of empyema increases the risk of recurrent infection, worsening respiratory status, and potential spread of infection to other areas.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's history of NSTEMI and ongoing cardiac issues make him susceptible to recurrent arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Acute systolic heart failure (ASHF)/acute systolic (AS) leading in part to shock: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7%, moderate aortic stenosis (AS) with an aortic valve area (AoVA) of 1.0-1.2cm2, and significant mitral regurgitation (MR). Diuretics are being given, and the possibility of additional diuretics is being considered if urine output drops. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) is being used overnight.
2. Empyema: The patient initially had a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures from a fall, which has now become infected. Chest tube output has been declining, indicating incomplete drainage. Nafcillin is being continued for MSSA, and a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan is being performed"

- The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection.
- He also has acute respiratory failure, which is resolving, and acute kidney injury, now off continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- The patient's medications include lansoprazole (Prevacid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), and insulin (Lantus).
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 108/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination findings include coarse breath sounds, decreased breath sounds on the left side, and a jugular venous pressure of 8-9 cm.
- Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count of 202 K/uL, creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 237 mg/dL, and sodium of 141 mEq/L.
- The patient has a history of acute systolic heart failure (ASCHF), moderate aortic stenosis (AS), and three-vessel coronary artery disease, for which he is not currently a surgical candidate due to the empyema.
- The patient has an ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7%, moderate AS with an aortic valve area of 1.0-1.2 cm², and significant mitral regurgitation (MR).
- The patient is being managed with ongoing diuresis, BIPAP support, and discussion with an outpatient cardiologist regarding further management.
- The patient also has an empyema that developed secondary to rib fractures sustained in a fall, complicated by superinfection.
- The chest tube output has declined persistently, and the patient is afebrile.
- The plan includes continued treatment with nafcillin for MSSA, conversion to empyema drain, and follow-up chest X-ray to evaluate for lung collapse.
- The patient experienced an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and is being transitioned off of IV antibiotics to PO.
- The patient has acute kidney injury (ATN) with stable creatinine levels.
- The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water administration and lasix to remove solute.
- The patient is agitated and acutely delirious,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after the removal of an intra-aortic balloon pump, and his course has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute renal failure (now off continuous renal replacement therapy), resolving hypotension, and respiratory failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Acute Systolic Heart Failure (ASHF)/Acute Systolic Cardiomyopathy (ASC): The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7% and moderate aortic stenosis (AS) with an area of 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). This combination increases the risk of further heart failure and subsequent shock.

2. Empyema: The patient has an empyema, which is a bacterial infection within the pleural space. If not adequately treated, it may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially spread to other parts of the body.

3. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced an episode of VT, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated. It may recur if underlying factors such as electroly"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, renal failure, and pneumonia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including non-invasive ventilation, arterial line, and IV medications such as heparin, lorazepam, and nafcillin.

The patient's recent events include the removal of non-invasive ventilation and arterial line, administration of lorazepam for agitation, and initiation of Lantus insulin. A repeat CT scan of the chest revealed improvement in the patient's condition, with decreased loculated hydropneumothorices in the left pleural cavity and resolution of the right upper lobe collapse. However, new septal thickening attributed to hydrostatic edema was noted, as well as unchanged displaced fracture of the left seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs. The patient's bilateral pleural effusions also showed improvement.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate between 86-99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73-108 mmHg, respiratory rate between 17-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's maximum temperature recorded over the past 24 hours was 36.9°C (98."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease post myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and is currently admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia following intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Acute systolic heart failure (ASHF)/acute severe (AS) leading to shock: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7%, moderate aortic stenosis, and significant mitral regurgitation. Holding Lasix for apnea concern due to fear of pre-renal azotemia is noted.

2. Empyema: The patient has an empyema secondary to hemothorax caused by rib fractures from a fall. The output from the chest tube is persistently declining, and the patient is being treated with nafcillin for MSSA. A CT-guided drainage is planned, and the patient will be followed up with thoracic recommendations.

3. Coag-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) tip culture positive for GPC: Additional surveillance cultures growing GPC in one bottle, given additional catheter tip positive, will continue"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia following intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute renal failure (ARF), and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Heart Failure/Asymptomatic: The patient has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7% and moderate aortic stenosis (AS) with an aortic valve area (AVA) of 1.0-1.2 cm2 and 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). This combination can lead to further heart failure symptoms and decreased cardiac output.
2. Empyema: The patient has an empyema, which is a collection of pus in the pleural space. This can lead to persistent chest pain, fever, and respiratory distress. There is a risk of recurrence or spread of infection if not properly managed.
3. Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcal (CNS) Line Infection: The patient's central venous catheter tip culture was positive for CNS, indicating"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU due to cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's current condition includes acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7%, moderate aortic stenosis (AS) with an aortic valve area (AoVA) of 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). He is being managed with diuretics to remove excess fluid. The patient also has an empyema, which is being treated with nafcillin for MSSA and chest tube drainage. There have been episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT), but they have been successfully managed with medication.

Other issues include acute kidney injury (ATN), hypernatremia, agitation and altered mental status, anemia, shock liver (resolved), diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis, and gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Systolic CHF/AS: The patient's low EF and moderate AS with significant MR indicate a high risk for further cardiac complications, such as worsening heart failure or arrhythmias.

2. Empyema: Although the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy and chest tube drainage, there is a risk of ongoing infection and potential spread to other areas, such as the bloodstream.

3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's history of CAD and recent cardiac events increase the risk of recurrent VT or other arrhythmias.

4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's current kidney function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration or the development of chronic kidney disease.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not carefully managed.

6. Agitation and Altered Mental Status: The patient's delirium may persist or worsen, potentially leading to complications like falls or pressure ulcers.

7. Anemia: The patient's anemia requires ongoing monitoring and management to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.

8. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes needs to be carefully managed to prevent complications like hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's elevated lipid levels pose a long-term risk for cardiovascular events.

10. Peripheral Neuropathy: Although currently inactive, the patient's peripheral neuropathy may progress and impact his quality of life.

11. Gastroparesis: The patient's history of gastroparesis increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia or delayed gastric emptying.

12. Gastrointestinal Bleeding Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic measures to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, but there is still a risk of bleeding events.

13. Infection Control: The patient is at risk"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Acute systolic heart failure (ASHF) / Acute Systolic CHF (ASC): The patient has a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10-7%, moderate aortic stenosis (AS), and severe mitral regurgitation (MR). These findings suggest impaired cardiac function, which may lead to further episodes of heart failure and potential cardiogenic shock.

2. Empyema: The patient has a confirmed MSSA infection in the pleural space, leading to empyema. This condition can worsen if the infection spreads or if there is inadequate drainage. Complications such as pleural thickening, abscess formation, or pleural fibrosis can occur, requiring close monitoring and appropriate treatment.

3. Coagulation issues: The patient has an elevated prothrombin time (PT), activated partial"

1. Bolused lasix and restarted gtt but having apneic episodes. Lasix stopped and apnea resolved. This suggests that the patient may have experienced respiratory distress or difficulty breathing after receiving lasix (a diuretic) and restarting their fluids.

2. Started Vanco for 7-day course and repeated cx. CT made empyema tube. The patient was given Vancomycin, an antibiotic, for a 7-day course, and a CT scan was performed to create an empyema tube. This indicates the presence of an infection or abscess.

3. Agitated again overnight. Received prn ativan as well as seroquel 50. The patient was agitated overnight and received medication (Ativan and Seroquel) to help manage their agitation.

4. Codeine allergy and unknown allergy are noted. The patient has an allergy to codeine and another unknown allergen.

5. Lasix (furosemide) was started on [**2190-2-26**] 12:00 PM. Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) was initiated on [**2190-2-26**] 11:33 PM. These medications suggest the management of fluid overload and prevention of blood clots, respectively.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute kidney injury (now off continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Acute systolic heart failure (AS CHF)/acute severe (AS) with an ejection fraction of 10-7%, moderate aortic valve area, and 3+ mitral regurgitation. He is being managed with diuretics and bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP).
2. Empyema: The patient has an empyema that is being treated with nafcillin for MSSA and planned for chest tube drainage.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were managed with amiodarone.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with stable creatinine levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute kidney injury, and resolving hypotension and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Heart Failure/Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis (ASH/AS): The patient has a low ejection fraction, moderate aortic stenosis, and significant mitral regurgitation. This combination can lead to heart failure and further complications.

2. Empyema: The patient has developed a superinfected hemothorax secondary to rib fractures from a fall. This has resulted in an empyema, which is a collection of pus in the pleural space. The persistent decline in chest tube output indicates ongoing infection. Nafcillin therapy has been initiated for MSSA, and plans are in place for computed tomography-guided drainage. Ongoing follow-up with a thoracic surgeon is recommended.

3. Coag-Negative Staphylococcal Culture Tip: Surveillance cultures have grown gram-positive cocci (GPC) in one bottle, suggesting a possible line infection. Vancomycin will be continued for a seven-day course pending final"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who underwent thoracic surgery and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of codeine allergy, unknown, as well as previous antibiotic use including vancomycin and nafcillin. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other medications in the ICU.

Vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 110/55 mmHg to 124/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's weight is currently 95 kg, with a total fluid intake of 1580 mL, including 220 mL of total fluids given intravenously. The patient's output includes 880 mL of oral intake and 700 mL of intravenous fluids, resulting in a balance of 915 mL with a negative 280 mL difference.

The patient is not currently on respiratory support, but their ABG results show pH at 7.29. Physical examination findings are incomplete due to non-assessment of peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other systems.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 208 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.8 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) at 90 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 2.3 to 3.3 mg/dL, glucose levels fluctuating between 90 mg/dL and 284 mg/dL, and various other lab abnormalities including elevated PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Amylase/Lipase, and elevated levels of LDH, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4.

The patient has multiple medical complications including alteration in nutrition, impaired physical mobility, acute heart failure (CHF), decubitus ulcer, respiratory failure (not ARDS), bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), anxiety, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, septic shock, acute renal failure (ARF), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and other types of shock.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, lines (PICC line), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and various comments regarding communication, code status, and disposition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU due to cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. The patient is now much improved overall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) leading to shock: The patient has a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7% and moderate aortic stenosis, which can lead to further heart failure and potential complications such as arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and hypotension.

2. Empyema: The patient has developed an empyema, which is a collection of pus in the pleural space. If not properly managed, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, septic shock, and potential surgical intervention may be required.

3. Coagulation issues: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a potential risk of bleeding or clotting complications.

4. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced episodes of VT, which could"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute kidney injury (now off continuous renal replacement therapy), resolving hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently much improved overall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Heart Failure (ASHF)/Acute Shock (AS): The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7%, moderate aortic stenosis (AS) with an aortic valve area of 1.0-1.2cm2, and 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR). Lasix administration is being held due to concerns about apnea and the possibility of the patient becoming pre-renal. The patient's AS and 3-vessel CAD make him not a surgical candidate at this time, given the presence of empyema. Close monitoring and discussion with an outpatient cardiologist are recommended.

2. Empyema: The patient initially had a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures resulting from a fall, which then became complicated by a superinfection. Chest tube"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus, who was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after intra-aortic balloon pump removal. He developed septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection. The patient's condition has improved overall.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Heart Failure (ASHF) with Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a severely decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7%, moderate aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 1.0-1.2cm2, and significant mitral regurgitation. This combination can lead to further heart failure and worsening of the patient's cardiac status.
2. Empyema: The patient has an ongoing empyema, which is a collection of pus in the pleural space. If not properly managed, it can progress and lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or septicemia.
3. Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcal (CNS) Infection: The patient has a culture tip positive for CNS, indicating a potential infection. This requires continued surveillance and appropriate antibiotic treatment.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced episodes of VT, which can be life-threatening. Close monitoring and appropriate antiarrhyth"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after the removal of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection. He also had acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), and acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with aortic stenosis (AS).

The patient's current status shows improvement overall. However, he still requires close monitoring and management for several issues. These include acute systolic CHF/AS, empyema, acute kidney injury, agitation and mental status changes, anemia, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic CHF/AS: The patient has moderate AS and 3+ mitral regurgitation (MR), leading to euvolemic status. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is necessary to prevent further decompensation.
2. Empyema: The patient has a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-inch tall adult with a current weight of 95 kg and an admission weight of 98 kg. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been admitted with several medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 58 to 123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on sinus rhythm and has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic examinations.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The kidney function tests indicate impaired renal function, with elevated creatinine levels. The blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury, as well as elevated lactate acid levels, suggesting possible tissue hypoxia.

The patient's medical history includes heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of renal failure. The patient is currently being treated for various conditions, including pneumonia, anxiety, impaired physical mobility, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as there is an alteration in nutrition and impaired physical mobility. The patient requires effective glycemic control and proper wound care due to the presence of a decubitus ulcer."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia following the removal of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock from methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema/line infection, acute kidney injury (ARF) with resolving hypotension and respiratory failure, ventricular tachycardia (VT), agitation and mental status changes, anemia, shock liver, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 88/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination are not assessed due to the patient's condition.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count of 208 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 227 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's kidney function is currently stable, and medications are being dosed accordingly. The patient's liver enzymes and other laboratory values are within normal limits.

The patient's medical complications include acute systolic heart failure (ASHF) leading to shock, empyema, acute kidney injury, ventricular tachycardia, agitation and delirium, anemia, shock liver, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current treatment plan includes ongoing management of ASHF/AS, empyema, ARF, VT, agitation and mental status changes, anemia, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient will continue to receive vancomycin for a possible line infection and nafcillin for MSSA empyema. The patient's code status is full code.

In summary, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of CAD and DM admitted with cardiogenic shock, complicated by septic shock, ARF, VT, agitation and delirium, anemia, shock liver, hyperlipidemia, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis, and a history of GIB. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he has several ongoing medical complications that require close monitoring and management."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock secondary to global ischemia after the removal of intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient's course has been complicated by septic shock due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) empyema and line infection, acute kidney injury with resolution, and respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)/Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has a severely reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 10-7% and moderate AS with an aortic valve area of 1.0-1.2cm2 and 3+ mitral regurgitation. This may lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and further deterioration of cardiac function.

2. Empyema: The patient has an empyema that is complicated by a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures from a fall. Persistent decline in chest tube output indicates ongoing infection and potential worsening of the empyema.

3. Coag-Negative Staphylococcal Culture Tip: Surveillance cultures have grown gram-positive cocci (GPC) in one bottle, suggesting a possible line infection. Continuing vancomycin for a 7-day course is recommended pending final culture data.

4. Ventricular Tachycardia"
