 tylenol, oxycodone
   # Left clavicular superficial skin lesion: no e/o fx on cxr, may be

","The patient is an elderly gentleman with multiple medical issues. The chief complaint is not mentioned in the progress note, but there are several significant events and ongoing assessments/plans.

24-hour events:
- The patient remained alkalemic overnight.
- Anion gap was closed.
- Insulin drip was converted to NPH (Neutral Proximate) and HISS (Humalog Insulin Suspension) with D51/2NS (half-normal saline).
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), with an appropriate bump after the second unit.
- Ciprofloxacin was given at 12:15 AM.

Allergies:
- No known drug allergies.

Infusions:
- Dextrose 50% was started at 10:46 PM.
- Pantoprazole (Protonix) was started at 06:01 AM.

Other medications:
- Changes to medical and family history are not mentioned.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Review of systems:
- This section is not provided in the given information.

Flow sheet data as of [**2183-6-6**] 06:38 AM:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate is 77 bpm with a range of 75-92 bpm, blood pressure is 146/59 mmHg with a range of 138-161/50-68 mmHg, respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute with a range of 11-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on hemodynamic monitoring.
- Fluid balance: Total input is 4,073 mL with 1,842 mL given intravenously, total output is 1,172 mL with 486 mL via urine, resulting in a balance of 2,901 mL.
- Respiratory support: The patient is not on respiratory support, but oxygen delivery device and ABG values are mentioned.
- Physical examination: The patient appears to be in no acute distress. No jugular venous distention (JVD) is noted, and dry mucous membranes are observed. Heart sounds are distant without murmurs, and bilateral clear lung auscultation is heard. Tenderness is present about the left clavicular head. No abdominal tenderness or distension is noted, and no lower extremity swelling, tenderness, or edema is observed. Strength in the left lower extremity is 2/5, and in the right lower extremity, it is 4/5. A decubitus ulcer is present.
- Neurological examination: The patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) are assessed as 2/5.
- Labs/Radiology: Several lab results are provided, including potassium, sodium, glucose, creatinine"

   An 83 year old man admitted to the ICU with diabetics ketoacidosis, GI
   bleed.  His acidosis has resolved and has shown no evidence of GI
   bleed.  He is doing well today.
   #  Diabetic Ketoacidosis: After insulin/glucose overnight the patient
   is no longer in DKA.  His anion gap has resolved, blood sugars remain
   in the 200 range and he is not acidemic.

   #  GIB: The patient has not shown evidence of continued bleed.  No
   stools passed yet.  His hematocrit trend is difficult to interpret
   given his obvious hemoconcentration, fluid rehydration and blood
   transfusion.  However, he is now stable at a hematocrit of 30.  Related
   anemia appears to be anemia of chronic disease with low reticulocyte

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old man admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's acidosis has resolved, and there is no evidence of ongoing GI bleed. His vital signs are stable, and he is not in distress. The patient is currently receiving NPH and Humalog insulin for glycemic control, and his blood sugar levels are within the target range.

The patient's recent medical history includes MRSA bacteremia and surgery for a hip fracture, which was treated with a 10-day course of antibiotics without evidence of endocarditis. He also has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and has had a difficult Foley placement in the past. The patient's medications include ciprofloxacin, pantoprazole, and dextrose 50%.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. His kidney function is within normal limits, but his liver enzymes are slightly elevated. The patient's electrolytes are also within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of diabetic ketoacidosis, monitoring for any signs of GI bleed, and addressing his anemia of chronic disease. The patient's primary respiratory alkalosis needs further investigation, and he is being followed up with imaging and additional tests. The patient's recent history of MRSA bacteremia and hip fracture surgery is being monitored,"

1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's DKA has resolved after receiving insulin and glucose. Blood sugars remain in the 200 range, and he is no longer acidemic. The plan is to continue monitoring finger sticks, administer NPH insulin, and monitor electrolytes.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed (GIB): The patient has not shown evidence of continued bleeding. His hematocrit trend is difficult to interpret due to fluid rehydration and blood transfusion. However, he is now stable at a hematocrit of 30. Anemia appears to be anemia of chronic disease with low reticulocyte count (2.0) given his profound anemia. Further investigation is needed, and the patient should be typed and crossed, maintaining large bore access. A consultation with the GI team is recommended, and they do not advise endoscopy at this time.

   .
   An 83 year old man admitted to the ICU with diabetics ketoacidosis, GI
   bleed.  His acidosis has resolved and has shown no evidence of GI
   bleed.  Blood cx now with MRSA.
   # MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cx from admission now with MRSA.  In [**4-24**]
   treated for 10 day course at OSH for MRSA bacteremia  with
   vanc/linezolid without TEE evidence of endocarditis.   Now blood cx
   again growing MRSA.  Possible source may be hardware.  He had films and
   CT of his hip yesterday. Ortho saw him and would not recommend
   operative intervention even if so.  Another possible source would be R
   subcutaneous fluid collection which is of unclear etiology.  US
   yesterday showed that it is very small, per radiology unlikely able to
   drain but need to discuss further with IR.
   - continue vancomycin
   - discuss with ID course of abx and whether we should push for ortho to
   remove hardware.
   - discuss with IR if the fluid collectionmight be able to be drained
   #  Diabetic Ketoacidosis:  His anion gap has resolved,  and BS are now
   normal.  He is on his home dose of NPH.
   - q4 finger sticks/HISS
   - NPH 10 units AM/5 units PM
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolyte monitoring
   #  GIB:  Hematocrit has been stable,  slightly down today.  No further
   melena.  Related anemia appears to be anemia of chronic disease with
   low reticulocyte count (2.0) given his profound anemia.   GI following
   and no plans for endscopy currently.
   - T&S
   - Q12 Hct with goal Hct >25
   - Typed and crossed, maintain large bore access
   - advance diet
   # UTI:  Had been on ciprofloxacin, now urine is growing pseudomonas.
   - change to Zosyn
   - await sensitivities
   #.  Elevated INR: correcting, possible contribution of poor nutrition
   #. Dementia/Delirum
 Likely delirium secondary ot infection.  Much

","The patient is an 83-year-old man with multiple medical conditions and complications. The key findings from the progress note include:

1. The patient was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
2. His acidosis has resolved, and there is no evidence of ongoing GI bleeding.
3. Blood cultures have grown methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), indicating a possible MRSA bacteremia.
4. The source of the MRSA bacteremia may be hardware related or a subcutaneous fluid collection.
5. The patient's fracture hardware is intact, and there is no evidence of loosening or fracture.
6. The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia in the past, which was treated with vancomycin and linezolid.
7. He also has an unresolved decubitus ulcer.
8. The patient's anion gap has resolved, and his blood sugars are now normal, indicating resolution of DKA.
9. His hematocrit has stabilized, and there is no further melena, suggesting improvement in GIB.
10. The patient's urine culture is growing Pseudomonas, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI).
11. The patient's elevated INR is being corrected, possibly due to poor nutrition.
12. The patient likely has delirium secondary to infection, as he is now alert and oriented.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
