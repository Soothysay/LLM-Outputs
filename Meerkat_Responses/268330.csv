   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   53M severe COPD - fractured his right elbow [**9-18**] and underwent external
   fixation. Returns to the hospital because of persistent vomiting and
   diarrhea at rehab. Has been on gent and PO vanco for recent pseudomonas
   pneumonia and CDiff. Also concern about a broken external fixation
   devise.
   In ER Temp was 102.3 and WBC count 26. Pins were noted to be missing
   from his right arm and ortho is taking him back to the OR to replace
   these. A CXR showed stable effusions and opacities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with severe COPD who has been admitted to the ICU. He underwent external fixation for a fractured right elbow and was later readmitted due to persistent vomiting and diarrhea. The patient has been on gentamicin and PO vancomycin for recent pseudomonas pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infection. There is also concern about a broken external fixation device.

The patient presented to the emergency room with a fever of 102.3 and a white blood cell count of 26. Pins were noted to be missing from his right arm, and orthopedics took him back to the operating room to replace these. A chest X-ray showed stable effusions and opacities.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to codeine, penicillins, and metformin. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and unable to provide a history. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/70 to 92/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has sinus tachycardia on an electrocardiogram.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,768 mL, including 768 mL of intravenous fluids. His urine output is 250 mL, and he has drained 400 mL of nasal gastric fluid. Stool output is not mentioned. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube, and his ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%, peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O. His arterial blood gas values indicate a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 52 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen of 224 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 354,000/mm3, platelet count of 86,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen level of 0.6 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, glucose level of 86 mg/dL, sodium level of 141 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, chloride level of 102 mEq/L, total CO2 level of 34 mEq/L, and calcium level of 8.5 mg/dL. His lactate level is 0.7 mmol/L, and his magnesium level is 1.4 mg/dL. The patient's imaging"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who has been in the ICU for multiple complications. These include pneumonia, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, seizures, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with an ESBL-producing E. coli urinary tract infection. He also has a history of iron deficiency anemia, diabetes, and anxiety.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 108/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 354 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased bowel sounds, mild tenderness in the mid lower abdomen, no peripheral edema, and distal pulses present. The chest X-ray is similar to previous X-rays.

The patient's plan includes treating the ESBL E. coli infection with meropenem, discontinuing vancomycin and gentamicin, continuing Flagyl IV, and restarting oral medications. The patient's respiratory support will be continued"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, tracheostomy, and recent prolonged hospitalization after a mechanical fall resulting in right radius and ulnar fractures. The patient has experienced several medical complications including PEA arrest after trach change, COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, clinical seizures with negative EEG, and altered mental status.

The patient presents with worsening wrist pain and the following potential medical complications:

1. Leukocytosis/fever: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which could be due to various sources such as pneumonia, C. diff infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), right arm, or midline infection. The tracheostomy site shows purulence and tenderness, indicating a possible infection. The patient's history of pseudomonas pneumonia and the presence of purulence at the tracheostomy site suggest the possibility of pseudomonas infection. The CXR should provide more information about the lung infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to COPD exacerbation. The current ventilator settings are Assist Control (AC) 500x16, PEEP 5, and the ABG shows pH 7.41, PaCO2 52, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio 224. These findings indicate respiratory acidosis with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, prolonged hospitalization, mechanical fall resulting in radius and ulnar fractures, and complications such as PEA arrest, COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, clinical seizures, and altered mental status.

The patient presented with worsening wrist pain and was found to be febrile. The leukocytosis/fever assessment indicates the presence of an infection, likely C. difficile, as the patient had diarrhea at rehab and was on vancomycin orally. The urine culture from the previous hospital is growing ESBL E. coli, which is resistant to gentamicin. Therefore, treatment with meropenem will be initiated.

Regarding the respiratory failure, the patient is tracheostomy-dependent due to COPD. The plan is to attempt weaning from assisted ventilation to partial support. Pain control for the ulna/radius fracture will be managed with IV morphine as needed. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation will be continued, and fondaparinux for DVT prophylaxis will be started.

The patient's chronic obstructive lung disease will be managed by changing IV steroids to oral steroids and using nebs as needed. Seizure management will continue with keppra. The fungal rash on the back will be"

   ICU Care
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, Compazine, penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. The patient received antibiotics including vancomycin, gentamicin, piperacillin, and metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.7Â°F), heart rate between 73-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/72 to 114/78 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,800 mL, with 850 mL given through intravenous fluids. The total output is 650 mL, with 280 mL through urine. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, HCO3- of 112 mEq/L, SaO2 of 100%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 224. The patient's Ve (minute ventilation) is 7.2 L/min.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other systems.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 21.3 K/uL, Hct of 29.2%, Plt of 354 K/uL, Cr of 0.6 mg/dL, TCO2 of 34, Glucose of 86 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

Assessment and plan: The patient has a fever with a temperature of 37.6Â°C. The ICU care continues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum culture will be important to identify any potential infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Regular lower extremity assessments and consideration of prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or anticoagulation may be necessary.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility increases the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments and repositioning are essential to prevent and detect pressure ulcers early.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive devices increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate cultures will be important to prevent and manage potential infections."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a history of tracheostomy, recent prolonged hospitalization after a mechanical fall resulting in right radius and ulnar fractures, complicated by pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest after tracheostomy change, COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, clinical seizures though negative electroencephalogram (EEG), and altered mental status. The patient presents with worsening wrist pain and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which could be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or C. diff infection. Possible sources of infection include UTI, respiratory infection (h/o Pseudomonas aeruginosa), right arm, and midline site. The patient's external fixation has broken, although there is no inflammation at the site. The midline site appears clean.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, who has been experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient's current condition includes worsening wrist pain, fevers, respiratory failure, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, and fractures in the right ulna and radius.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has leukocytosis (high white blood cell count) and fever, which are common signs of a UTI. The reported growth of ESBL E. coli in the urine culture suggests that the patient may have an antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infection.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with a history of prolonged hospitalization and antibiotic use, raise concerns for a C. diff infection. Further testing and treatment for C. diff are recommended.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture showed the presence of PsA, indicating a possible pneumonia infection. This should be further investigated and treated accordingly.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to severe COPD and chronic steroid use. The ABG results show a slightly alkalotic pH, indicating the need for continued airway support. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and transitioning to spontaneous breathing should be done cautiously.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, tracheostomy, and recent prolonged hospitalization after a mechanical fall resulting in right radius and ulnar fractures. He underwent external fixation but experienced a PEA arrest following tracheostomy change. The patient also had COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, clinical seizures though negative EEG, and altered mental status.

Current issues include worsening wrist pain, fevers, leukocytosis, potential sources of infection such as pneumonia, C. diff, urinary tract infection (UTI), right arm, and tracheostomy site. The tracheostomy site shows purulence and tenderness upon palpation. The patient has a history of pseudomonas pneumonia, and his chest X-ray indicates bilateral effusions similar to the previous X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Leukocytosis/fever: Possible sources include pneumonia, C. diff, UTI, right arm, and tracheostomy site. Tracheostomy site is purulent and tender. He has a history of pseudomonas pneumonia. CXR shows bilateral effusions. It is unclear if he is still on oral vancomycin (Vanc). His symptoms mainly involve the gastrointestinal tract (GI). Urinary culture (UCx) is growing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, who has undergone tracheostomy and experienced several complications including pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, seizures, and altered mental status. The patient presented with worsening wrist pain and was found to be febrile.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Risk for injury: The patient's altered mental status and physical limitations may increase the risk of falls or other injuries.

2. Alteration in elimination related to diarrhea: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can cause diarrhea. This alteration in elimination can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Nausea/vomiting: The patient has a history of metformin-induced nausea/vomiting and is currently on multiple medications, which can contribute to gastrointestinal side effects.

4. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has been febrile on multiple occasions, indicating an underlying infection or inflammatory process.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient is tracheostomy-dependent due to severe COPD exacerbation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise due to infection, mucus plugging, or equipment malfunction.

6. Radius and ulnar fractures with external fixation: The patient has a history of fractures with external fixation, which may lead to complications such as infection or non-union.

7. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy suggests the possibility of hypercarbic respiratory failure due to inadequate elimination of carbon dioxide.

8. Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD): The patient has a chronic condition that can lead to exacerbations and respiratory failure.

9. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizures, which may recur due to underlying neurological issues or medication side effects.

10. Fungal rash: The patient has a fungal infection on the back, which may require specific treatment and monitoring.

11. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes, which requires ongoing management to prevent complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

12. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia, which may contribute to fatigue and weakness.

13. Anxiety/agitation: The patient has a history of anxiety and agitation, which may require psychiatric evaluation and management.

14. FEN (enteral nutrition): The patient is receiving tube feeds, which need to be monitored for proper delivery and absorption.

15. PPx (prophylactic antibiotic): The patient is receiving fondaparinux for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

16. Access: The patient has midline access for intravenous medication administration.

17. Code status: The patient has a full code status, indicating that all resuscitative measures should be taken in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with severe COPD who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes recent prolonged hospitalization after a mechanical fall resulting in right radius and ulnar fractures, surgical placement of external fixation, and complications such as PEA arrest after tracheostomy change, COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, clinical seizures though negative EEG, and altered mental status. 

The patient presents with worsening wrist pain and fevers. The leukocytosis/fever could be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) or C. diff. Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, the right arm, and midline site. The external fixation has broken, but there is no inflammation at the site. The midline site appears clean.

The patient is tracheostomy-dependent from COPD and on chronic steroids. The current ventilator settings are assist/control (AC) 50/16/5/0.5, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) on this setting is 7.41/52/112. The plan is to continue AC support for now, try pressure support (PS) today if tolerated, and try spontaneous breathing tomorrow. The current dose of prednisone should be continued, and the formulation should be switched to intravenous for now.

The patient has a history of C. diff and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent tracheostomy and has experienced multiple complications including prolonged hospitalization, mechanical fall resulting in radius and ulnar fractures with external fixation, PEA arrest after tracheostomy change, COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, clinical seizures, and altered mental status. The patient presents with worsening wrist pain and fevers.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which are common signs of a UTI. The urine culture is negative, but blood cultures and C. diff tests are pending.

2. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has a history of C. diff and presents with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Further evaluation and treatment for C. diff infection are planned.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status may worsen due to COPD exacerbation and VAP. The patient is currently on antibiotics, and cultures are pending.

4. Fracture complications: The patient has fractures in the radius and ulnar bones with external fixation. Although there is no inflammation at the site, the broken external fixation may lead to further complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, who has undergone tracheostomy and experienced multiple complications including PEA arrest, COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, clinical seizures, and altered mental status. The patient presents with worsening wrist pain and fevers. There are concerns about potential infections such as urinary tract infection (UTI) or C. difficile, given the presence of leukocytosis and GI symptoms. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to COPD and chronic steroid use. He also has a history of fractures in the right arm and midline, but these sites appear clean. The patient's nutrition is being provided through a feeding tube, and his glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD and recent prolonged hospitalization after a mechanical fall resulting in a radius and ulnar fracture. The patient underwent external fixation but experienced a PEA arrest after tracheostomy change. The patient also has a history of COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, clinical seizures though negative EEG, and altered mental status.

The patient presented with worsening wrist pain and was found to be febrile. Leukocytosis was noted, presumed to be due to C. diff infection. The patient is currently on vancomycin orally and metronidazole IV for refractory C. diff infection. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to COPD, and they are tracheostomy-dependent. The patient has been weaned to pressure support ventilation and is expected to attempt tracheostomy collar weaning tomorrow.

The patient has a history of ulna/radius fracture with external fixation, which was removed yesterday. An X-ray will be obtained today to assess the healing progress. Pain control with IV morphine is recommended as needed. Calcium and vitamin D supplements are also advised. Fondaparinux is prescribed for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient has had several medical complications including respiratory failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive lung disease, seizures, fungal rash, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, and anxiety/agitation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 140/63 mmHg to 148/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently receiving pressure support ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (21.3 K/uL) and leukocytosis (13.6 K/uL), as well as elevated blood glucose levels (95 mg/dL). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium (3.0 mEq/L) and magnesium (1.7 mg/dL) levels. The patient's kidney function appears to be normal based on the creatinine level (0.6 mg/dL).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, who underwent tracheostomy and had multiple complications including prolonged hospitalization, mechanical fall resulting in fractures of the radius and ulnar bones, PEA arrest after tracheostomy change, COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, clinical seizures though negative EEG, and altered mental status. The patient presents with worsening wrist pain and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UTI: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which could indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI). The culture from the rehabilitation center shows growth of ESBL E. coli, but our culture is negative. It is planned to cover for ESBL E. coli for 14 days.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on the tracheostomy and chronic steroids for respiratory support due to COPD. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode is being continued. The possibility of trying tracheostomy change today is mentioned.

3. Radius and Ulna Fractures: The patient had fractures of the radius and ulnar bones, which were managed with external fixation. Orthopedics recommended splinting after removing the external fixation. Occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) will be followed.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with severe COPD who has undergone tracheostomy and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of mechanical fall resulting in right radius and ulnar fractures, which were treated with external fixation. The patient also had a previous PEA arrest after tracheostomy change, COPD exacerbation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, clinical seizures with negative EEG, and altered mental status.

The patient presents with worsening wrist pain and fevers. The possible medical complications that can arise include:

1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which are common signs of UTI. This could be due to the use of urinary catheterization.

2. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. diff colitis and is currently on Flagyl and oral vancomycin. It is important to continue monitoring for recurrence of symptoms.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is tracheostomy-dependent due to severe COPD and chronic steroid use. The plan is to continue weaning off ventilator support and consider tracheostomy tube change.

4. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has a history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. There is a concern for continued C. difficile infection or other gastrointestinal causes.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo m with hx of severe COPD, s/p trach, and recent prolonged
   hospitalizzation after a mechanical fall resulting in R radius and
   ulnar fracture s/p external fixation complicated by PEA arrest after
   trach change, COPD exacerbation, VAP, C. diff colitis, clinical
   seizures though negative EEG, and altered mental status who presents
   with worsening wrist pain and fevers.
   # Leukocytosis/fever:  Most likely from UTI.  UCx from rehab is
   reportedly growing ESBL E. coli, but no sensitivities are given.  Ours
   is negative.  Now improving.
   - [**Last Name (un) **] to cover ESBL E. coli x 14 days
   - D/c Flagyl/po vanc now that c. diff negative
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient is trach-dependent from COPD and on
   chronic steroids.
   - Cont PS
 try TC again today (?PMV)
   - Cont current dose of prednisone 7 mg
   # R ulna/radius fracture, s/p external fixation on [**10-7**]:  Orthopedics
   removed external fixation and now recommending splinting.
   - OT/PT following
   - Cont. calcium and vitamin D
   - DVT ppx with Fondaparinux
   - Will finalize furthe recs with Ortho

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who has undergone a tracheostomy and experienced multiple complications including pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, seizures, and altered mental status. The patient presents with worsening wrist pain and fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which could be indicative of a UTI. The recent urine culture showed growth of ESBL E. coli, but the patient's urine culture is negative. Antibiotics have been started to cover ESBL E. coli for 14 days.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tracheostomy-dependent due to COPD and is on chronic steroids. He continues to require positive airway pressure (PS) support and attempts to trial tracheostomy tube removal will be made. The current dose of prednisone will be continued.
3. Radius and Ulna Fractures: The patient has fractures of the right radius and ulna, which were previously treated with external fixation. Orthopedics recommend splinting instead. Physical therapy and occupational therapy will be continued. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation will be continued, and Fondaparinux will be used for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
4. Clostridium difficile Colitis: The patient's C. difficile test was"
