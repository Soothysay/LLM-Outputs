","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of acute dyspnea, improved on CPAP, and experiencing episodes of acute dyspnea overnight. The patient has been placed on non-invasive ventilation multiple times due to these episodes. Blood cultures were drawn from the peripheral site and nasal swab for MRSA. The patient has been receiving various medications including Heparin Sodium, Metoprolol, Furosemide, and Morphine.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's repeated episodes of acute dyspnea and the need for non-invasive ventilation indicate a possible respiratory failure. This could be due to underlying lung disease or complications from myocardial infarction.

2. Infection: The presence of blood cultures and nasal swab for MRSA suggests a concern for infection. In the ICU setting, patients are at higher risk for acquiring healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures should be considered to prevent clot formation.

4. Gastrointestinal Ulcers: Prolonged use of certain medications, such as corticosteroids or H2 blockers, can increase the risk of stress ulcers in critically ill patients. Monitoring for signs of"

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF and
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress with increasing oxygen
   requirement.
   1. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening over last 24 hours.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%. Has underlying COPD. Cannot rule out fibrosis of lungs, further
   exacerbating respiratory status. Clinically, some improvement of
   dyspnea with diuresis of 2L yesterday and better rate and BP control
   with BBker.
   - Continue high flow mask, wean down O2 as tolerated. Non-invasive
   ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus OK to
   ventilate in case of respiratory failure
   - Continue Lasix to goal net fluid balance of 500cc-1L today
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control (was uptitrated to 37.5
   mg TID yesterday and tolerating it well at this time). Pt does have
   NSTEMI and very depressed EF however clinically respiratory status
   improved with rate and BP control.
   - Consider CT chest without contrast in near future to check for other
   etiologies of hypoxia such as pulm fibrosis
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   2. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T 0.67 this AM (highest so far). CK
s downward
   trending.  The severely depressed EF and global hypokinesis is
   concerning for severe LAD disease though the RV seems abnormal as
   well.  Pt likely had a silent MI several days ago.
   - Continue with ASA, plavix and heparin for now; not on integrillin due
   to ARF
   - Pt was on cardiology floor prior to transfer to ICU- will touch base
   with cardiology for further plans (?cath) and recs on length of heparin
   therapy.
   - Hct 29.5 today, no transfusions needed.
   3. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; now stable in mid-2
   Etiology is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting of AMI is possible.
   - Follow daily serum Cr especially in setting of diuresis
   4. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Unclear if
   pathology has returned from [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy. Thoracic surgery
   aware patient is in house, will follow along. No contraindication to
   anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology deemed pt non-surgical candidate; re-evaluate in several
   weeks. Signed off.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   5. Positive UTI:
   - Continue Cipro with plan for [**7-18**] day course.
   6. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   7. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic .
   - Hct 29.5 today. Will continue to monitor.
   8. Depression.  Continue sertraline.
   FEN: NPO as pt become dyspneic off mask. Refrain from further IVF
   ACCESS: 1 PIV
   PROPHYLAXIS: Heparin gtt, bowel regimen. No indications for PPI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoking, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress and increasing oxygen requirement. The patient has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and may have fibrosis of the lungs, further exacerbating his respiratory status.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient received Lasix 80 mg IV twice, diuresing well, and had episodes of acute dyspnea overnight but improved on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). He was placed on non-invasive ventilation multiple times due to respiratory distress. Blood cultures and a nasal swab for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were taken.

The patient is currently on several medications, including heparin sodium, metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), and morphine sulfate. He also has a history of depression and is taking sertraline.

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF and
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress with increasing oxygen
   requirement.
   1. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening over last 24 hours.  Received
   pre-catherization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%. Has underlying COPD. Cannot rule out fibrosis of lungs, further
   exacerbating respiratory status. Clinically, some improvement of
   dyspnea with diuresis of 2L yesterday and better rate and BP control
   with BBker.
   - Continue high flow mask, wean down OThis partly coincides with IVF
   for possible cath and blood transfusion this AM.  EF was noted to be
   10-15% though the chronicity of this is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 4721**], pulmonary
   edema (either cardiogenic or from TACO) is the most likely etiology
   though other causes, including PE, PNA, lymphangitic spread of tumor
   all coinciding with underlying COPD.
   - Continue NRB for now; if decompensates can consider CPAP; family to
   discuss code status
   - Responded to 60mg IV lasix; if UO falls below 100cc/hr, will redose
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   - Consider checking LENIs (already on heparin)
   2. NSTEMI.  Troponin of 0.46 and 0.58 with 123 and 271.  The severely
   depressed EF and global hypokinesis is concerning for severe LAD
   disease though the RV seems abnormal as well.
   - Continue with ASA, plavix and heparin for now; not on integrillin due
   to ARF
   - Will hold on further IVF for the moment given possible pulmonary
   edema; got one unit of blood with hct change of 25 to 27
   - Cards consult
   3. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; now up to 2.3.  Etiology
   is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting of AMI is possible.
   - Follow daily SCr
   4. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Unclear if
   pathology has returned from [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy. Thoracic surgery
   aware patient is in house, will follow along. No contraindication to
   anticoagulation currently.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   5. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   6. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic .
   - Initial plan to transfuse to hct now made difficult by hypoxia
   7. Depression.  Continue sertraline.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoker, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia. He has been transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress with increasing oxygen requirement. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 112/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention, regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, decreased crackles bilaterally, warm extremities without edema, and good spirits. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, blood glucose of 129 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.67, lactate acid of 2.8 mmol/L, calcium of 8.8 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.2 mg/dL, and phosphate of 6.5 mg/dL. The patient is currently on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 95%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and PIP of 11 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 92, and oxygen consumption of 6.3 L/min. 

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, former smoking, and likely metastatic RCC. He presented with NSTEMI and hypoxia and is being treated for multiple conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise include hypoxia due to underlying COPD, pulmonary edema, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, renal mass with mediastinal lymphadenopathy suspicious for RCC, elevated INR, anemia, and depression. 

The plan includes continuing high-flow mask, weaning down O2, possible catheterization and blood transfusion, evaluating for pulmonary edema, NSTEMI, acute renal failure, renal mass, elevated INR, anemia, and depression. The patient's code status has been discussed with the family."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoking, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He presented with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia, and was found to have a depressed ejection fraction (EF) and worsening oxygen requirement. The patient has been experiencing increasing outpatient oxygen requirement over the last few months, with more acute worsening in the past 24 hours. His EF was noted to be 10-15%, although the chronicity of this is unclear.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's increasing oxygen requirement indicates respiratory distress, which could be due to pulmonary edema (either cardiogenic or from tumor-induced cardiomyopathy), other causes such as pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia (PNA), or lymphangitic spread of tumor, or underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

2. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating myocardial injury. Severe depression in EF and global hypokinesis suggest severe left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease, although right ventricular (RV) abnormality is also present.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine (SCr) has increased from 1.6 to 2.3. The etiology of ARF is unclear, but hypoper"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU for an acute myocardial infarction. He experienced a few episodes of acute dyspnea overnight and was placed on CPAP, which improved his condition. The patient required non-invasive ventilation multiple times, including at 06:00 PM on 03/19/2166 and 02:48 AM on 03/20/2166. Blood cultures were drawn from a peripheral site and a nasal swab for MRSA at 05:48 AM on 03/20/2166. The patient received various medications such as metoprolol, heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and morphine sulfate. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 67 bpm with a range of 63-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/44 mmHg to 154/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute with a range of 19-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 82 mL and output of 1,140 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support data are also provided.

Physical examination reveals the patient lying in bed with an NRB mask, appearing comfortable most of the time but occasionally appearing diaphoret"

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF and
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress with increasing oxygen
   requirement.
   1. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  However, hypoxia not improved after aggressive diuresis.  Has
   underlying COPD. Cannot rule out fibrosis of lungs, further
   exacerbating respiratory status.
   - Continue high flow mask, wean down O2 as tolerated. Non-invasive
   ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus OK to
   ventilate in case of respiratory failure
   - will stop lasix today
   - repeat ABG & CXR this morning.
   - If patient able to tolerate lying flat will check CT chest without
   contrast to evaluate for other etiologies (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis).
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   2. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T peaked at 0.69.  Cardiology does not feel that
   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely
   ischemic in origin.
   - Continue with ASA and beta-blocker for now; no plavix or heparin per
   cardiology
   3. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; slowly trending downward
   to 2.3 today.  Etiology is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting
   troponin bump is possible.
   - Follow daily serum Cr
   4. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Unclear if
   pathology has returned from [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy. Thoracic surgery
   aware patient is in house, will follow along. No contraindication to
   anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology will re-evaluate patient in several weeks when acute illness
   resolved; surgery still a possible option for consideration.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   5. Positive UTI:
   - Continue Cipro with plan for [**7-18**] day course (D1 = [**3-19**]).
   6. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   7. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic .
   - Hct 30  today. Will continue to monitor.
   8. Depression.  Continue sertraline.
   FEN: NPO as pt become dyspneic off mask. Refrain from further IVF if
   possible; no more lasix today
   ACCESS: 1 PIV
   PROPHYLAXIS: Heparin sc, bowel regimen. No indications for PPI

   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF and
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress with increasing oxygen
   requirement.
   1. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening over last 24 hours.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%. Has underlying COPD. Cannot rule out fibrosis of lungs, further
   exacerbating respiratory status. Clinically, some improvement of
   dyspnea with diuresis of 2L yesterday and better rate and BP control
   with BBker.
   - Continue high flow mask, wean down O2 as tolerated. Non-invasive
   ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus OK to
   ventilate in case of respiratory failure
   - Continue Lasix to goal net fluid balance of 500cc-1L today
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control (was uptitrated to 37.5
   mg TID yesterday and tolerating it well at this time). Pt does have
   NSTEMI and very depressed EF however clinically respiratory status
   improved with rate and BP control.
   - Consider CT chest without contrast in near future to check for other
   etiologies of hypoxia such as pulm fibrosis
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   2. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T 0.67 this AM (highest so far). CK
s downward
   trending.  The severely depressed EF and global hypokinesis is
   concerning for severe LAD disease though the RV seems abnormal as
   well.  Pt likely had a silent MI several days ago.
   - Continue with ASA, plavix and heparin for now; not on integrillin due
   to ARF
   - Pt was on cardiology floor prior to transfer to ICU- will touch base
   with cardiology for further plans (?cath) and recs on length of heparin
   therapy.
   - Hct 29.5 today, no transfusions needed.
   3. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; now stable in mid-2
   Etiology is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting of AMI is possible.
   - Follow daily serum Cr especially in setting of diuresis
   4. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Unclear if
   pathology has returned from [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy. Thoracic surgery
   aware patient is in house, will follow along. No contraindication to
   anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology deemed pt non-surgical candidate; re-evaluate in several
   weeks. Signed off.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   5. Positive UTI:
   - Continue Cipro with plan for [**7-18**] day course.
   6. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoker, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and increasing oxygen requirement.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has had increasing outpatient oxygen requirement over the last few months with more acute worsening over the past 24 hours. He received pre-catheterization hydration and blood products due to an ejection fraction (EF) of 10-15%. He also has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cannot rule out fibrosis of the lungs, further exacerbating respiratory status. Clinically, some improvement of dyspnea was observed with diuresis of 2L yesterday and better rate and blood pressure control with beta-blocker.
- Continue high flow mask, wean down O2 as tolerated. Non-invasive ventilation as needed. The patient is full code at this time, thus okay to ventilate in case of respiratory failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath and hypoxia. The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and acute myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3 C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/60 to 129/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on face tent. The patient is receiving various medications, including ativan for anxiety and respiratory distress. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a high sodium level of 151 mEq/L. The patient has received IV fluids, lasix, and KCl in D5W. The patient's urine output is within normal range, and the fluid balance is negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of shortness of breath and hypoxia indicates respiratory distress. This could be due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or another pulmonary condition. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 99% with the use of a face tent, but ongoing monitoring and support may be required.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and hypoxia. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, and no known drug allergies. 

Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation with shortness of breath and hypoxia suggests respiratory failure. The presence of scattered dry crackles bilaterally on physical examination indicates ongoing lung pathology. Monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation will be crucial to prevent further deterioration.

2. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) and abnormal ECG findings suggest an acute myocardial infarction. Ongoing cardiac monitoring and appropriate anti-ischemic and supportive therapy are essential to minimize cardiac complications.

3. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has a high sodium level (151 mEq/L) and free water deficit of 3L. This indicates dehydration and imbalances in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Careful monitoring and correction of these imbalances are necessary to avoid complications such as renal dysfunction or arrhythmias.

4. Infection: Although the ciprofloxacin was discontinued due to a negative urine culture, the patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible ongoing infection. Close surveillance for signs of infection and appropriate antimicrobial therapy will"

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF and
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   #. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  Hypoxia somewhat improved after aggressive diuresis. Has
   underlying COPD. Concern for pulmonary fibrosis, but CT chest showed
   severe emphysema and evidence of CHF,  not fibrosis. Also there is
   component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but PET scan does not
   seem consistent with this. CXR mildly improved with persistent R sided
   effusion.  Episode this AM may have been poor [**Location (un) 103**] of O2 Sat monitor
   given rapid improvement, absence of tachypnea, and stable ABG; however,
   cyanotic fingers are somewhat concerning. Cyanosis resolved on later
   exam. Given patient
s underlying emphysema, will treat as COPD
   exacerbation and continue diuresis today.
   - Continue high flow mask vs face tent, wean down O2 as tolerated.
   Non-invasive ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus
   OK to ventilate in case of respiratory failure
   - Begin solumedrol and levaquin today for COPD exacerbation. Check
   fingersticks w/ ISS while on solumedrol.
   - IV Lasix 80mg x 1 for I/O goal -500-1L today.
   - F/U sputum cultures and cytology.
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   #. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T peaked at 0.69.  Cardiology does not feel that
   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely
   ischemic in origin.
   - Continue with ASA and beta-blocker for now; no plavix or heparin per
   cardiology. F/U further cards recs.
   #. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; slowly trending downward
   to 2.0 today.  Etiology is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting
   troponin bump is possible.  Cr continues to trend down.
   - Follow daily serum Cr.
   #. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Pathology from
   [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy showed reactive lymph nodes, no tumor burden.
   Thoracic surgery aware patient is in house, will follow along. No
   contraindication to anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology will re-evaluate patient in several weeks when acute illness
   resolved; surgery still a possible option for consideration.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   #. Positive UTI: Given Cipro x 3 days. Urine culture negative, cipro
   d/c
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to aggressive diuresis with NPO status. On
   D5W with KCl replacement. Would prefer to give PO free water boluses.
   Given concern for aspiration, will place NGT today and start free water
   boluses.
   - Free water bolus via NG Tube.
   - Recheck PM lytes.
   #. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   #. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic .
   - Hct stable at 30. Will continue to monitor.
   #. Depression.  Continue sertraline.
   FEN: NPO as hypoxic off face mask and evidence of aspiration with meds.
   Will place NGT today and begin tube feeds. Unable to do formal
   speech/swallow consult and patient cannot tolerate being off face mask.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoking, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia, and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe emphysema, as well as a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 10-15%. He received aggressive diuretics and blood products prior to catheterization. His oxygenation improved after diuretic therapy, but he remains hypoxic. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including hypoxia, acute renal failure, NSTEMI, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's shortness of breath and low oxygen levels indicate respiratory distress. This could be due to severe emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a potential pulmonary embolism. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and providing high-flow nasal cannula oxygen may help manage this condition.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. This could be due to hypoperfusion or other causes. Monitoring daily serum creatinine levels and following fluid balance are crucial in managing this condition.

3. NSTEMI"

   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  However, hypoxia not improved after aggressive diuresis.  Has
   underlying COPD. Cannot rule out fibrosis of lungs, further
   exacerbating respiratory status.  Chest CT showed severe emphysema and

   CXR mildly improved.
   - Continue high flow mask, wean down O2 as tolerated. Non-invasive
   ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus OK to

   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoker, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress with increasing oxygen requirement. The patient has a depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 10-15% and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He received pre-catheterization hydration and blood products but did not show improvement in hypoxia after aggressive diuretic treatment. The patient also has acute renal failure, with serum creatinine (Cr) trending downward from 1.6 to 2.0 today. His current medications include metoprolol for rate and blood pressure control, and he is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and increasing oxygen requirement suggest potential complications related to inadequate oxygenation. This could be due to underlying COPD, lung fibrosis, or congestive heart failure (CHF).
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. The cause is unclear, but hypoperfusion in the setting of a troponin bump is possible. Monitoring daily serum creatinine is recommended.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin-T levels peaked at 0."

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF and
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   #. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  Hypoxia somewhat improved after aggressive diuresis. Has
   underlying COPD. Concern for pulmonary fibrosis, but CT chest showed
   severe emphysema and evidence of CHF,  not fibrosis. Also there is
   component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but PET scan does not
   seem consistent with this. CXR mildly improved with persistent R sided
   effusion.  Episode this AM may have been poor [**Location (un) 103**] of O2 Sat monitor
   given rapid improvement, absence of tachypnea, and stable ABG; however,
   cyanotic fingers are somewhat concerning. Cyanosis resolved on later
   exam. Given patient
s underlying emphysema, will treat as COPD
   exacerbation and continue diuresis today.
   - Continue high flow mask vs face tent, wean down O2 as tolerated.
   Non-invasive ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus
   OK to ventilate in case of respiratory failure
   - Begin solumedrol and levaquin today for COPD exacerbation. Check
   fingersticks w/ ISS while on solumedrol.
   - IV Lasix 80mg x 1 for I/O goal -500-1L today.
   - F/U sputum cultures and cytology.
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   #. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T peaked at 0.69.  Cardiology does not feel that
   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely
   ischemic in origin.
   - Continue with ASA and beta-blocker for now; no plavix or heparin per
   cardiology. F/U further cards recs.
   #. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; slowly trending downward
   to 2.0 today.  Etiology is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting
   troponin bump is possible.  Cr continues to trend down.
   - Follow daily serum Cr.
   #. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Pathology from
   [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy showed reactive lymph nodes, no tumor burden.
   Thoracic surgery aware patient is in house, will follow along. No
   contraindication to anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology will re-evaluate patient in several weeks when acute illness
   resolved; surgery still a possible option for consideration.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   #. Positive UTI: Given Cipro x 3 days. Urine culture negative, cipro
   d/c
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to aggressive diuresis with NPO status. On
   D5W with KCl replacement. Would prefer to give PO free water boluses.
   Given concern for aspiration, will place NGT today and start free water
   boluses.
   - Free water bolus via NG Tube.
   - Recheck PM lytes.
   #. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   #. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic .
   - Hct stable at 30. Will continue to monitor.
   #. Depression.  Continue sertraline.
   FEN: NPO as hypoxic off face mask and evidence of aspiration with meds.
   Will place NGT today and begin tube feeds. Unable to do formal
   speech/swallow consult and patient cannot tolerate being off face mask.

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoker, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He presented with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia, and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is suspected to have pulmonary fibrosis, but a CT chest showed severe emphysema and evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). There is also a concern for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but a positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not seem consistent with this. 

The patient has been treated with aggressive diuresis and is currently on high-flow mask ventilation with 100% oxygen. He is also receiving non-invasive ventilation as needed, and will continue to be weaned down from oxygen as tolerated. Solumedrol and levaquin have been started for COPD exacerbation, and intravenous Lasix has been administered for fluid output goal of -500 to -1L today. 

The patient's troponin-T level peaked at 0.69, indicating some cardiac injury, but cardiology does not feel that the patient currently has acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's severely depressed ejection fraction (EF) and global hypokinesis are indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic in origin.

   COPD, pulmonary edema, and large right sided effusion.  Continue
   diuresis as creatinine is improving,
   and oxygenation has improved.  Infiltrates were FDG avid on PET, but
   renal mass was not.  Worrisome for inflammatory process - as less
   likely that infiltrates are cancer given that primary mass was not FDG
   avid.  Will try to treat for PNA and with steroids.
   Renal cell carcinoma:  has renal mass, but not biopsied.
   hypernatremia:  replete free water

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with an ejection fraction of 15%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and renal cell carcinoma. He was admitted to the ICU after becoming hypoxemic following a blood transfusion and was previously on the cardiology service. The patient has been diuresed and showed improvement in respiratory status, being weaned down to 60% face mask overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure due to COPD, pulmonary edema, and a large right-sided effusion. This condition requires continuous monitoring and management.
2. Inflammatory Process: The patient's infiltrates on chest imaging were FDG-avid on PET scan, indicating a possible inflammatory process. Treatment for pneumonia (PNA) and steroids may be considered.
3. Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient has renal cell carcinoma with a renal mass, although it has not been biopsied yet. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be addressed by repleting free water.
5. Nutrition: The patient will have a nasogastric tube (NGT) placed to start nutrition and administer medications"

   Assessment and Plan
   H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]) and severe hypoxemia:
   COPD, pulmonary edema, and large right sided effusion.  Continue
   diuresis as creatinine is improving,
   and oxygenation has improved.  Infiltrates were FDG avid on PET, but
   renal mass was not.  Worrisome for inflammatory process - as less
   likely that infiltrates are cancer given that primary mass was not FDG
   avid, but infiltrates are.  Will try to treat for PNA and with
   steroids.
   Renal cell carcinoma:  has renal mass, but not biopsied.
   hypernatremia:  replete free water
   will place NGT to start nutrition, meds, free water.

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with possible NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF
   and transferred to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   #. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  Hypoxia somewhat improved after aggressive diuresis. Has
   underlying COPD. Concern for pulmonary fibrosis, but CT chest showed
   severe emphysema and evidence of CHF,  not fibrosis. Also there is
   component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but PET scan does not
   seem consistent with this. CXR mildly improved with persistent R sided
   effusion. Given patient
s underlying emphysema, will treat as COPD
   exacerbation. The patient has been aggrerssively diuresed, and will
   slow down diuresis as UOP tapering off.
   - Continue ventimask at 80%, but try to wean down as tolerated.
   Non-invasive ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus
   OK to ventilate in case of respiratory failure
   - Continue solumedrol and levaquin today for COPD exacerbation. Check
   fingersticks w/ ISS while on solumedrol.
   - Hold Lasix
   - F/U sputum cultures and cytology.
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   #. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T peaked at 0.69.  Cardiology does not feel that
   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely
   ischemic in origin.
   - Continue with ASA and beta-blocker for now; no plavix or heparin per
   cardiology. F/U further cards recs.
   #. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; slowly trending downward
   to 2.0 today.  Etiology is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting
   troponin bump is possible.  Cr had been normalizing, but now increasing
   as UOP declines.
   - Follow daily serum Cr.
   #. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Pathology from
   [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy showed reactive lymph nodes, no tumor burden.
   Thoracic surgery aware patient is in house, will follow along. No
   contraindication to anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology will re-evaluate patient in several weeks when acute illness
   resolved; surgery still a possible option for consideration.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   #. Positive UTI: Given Cipro x 3 days. Urine culture negative, cipro
   d/c
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to aggressive diuresis with NPO status. On
   D5W with KCl replacement. Would prefer to give PO free water boluses.
   Given concern for aspiration, will place NGT today and start free water
   boluses.
   - Free water bolus via NG Tube.
   - Recheck lytes [**Hospital1 **].
   #. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   #. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic .
   - Hct stable at 30. Will continue to monitor.
   #. Depression.  Continue sertraline.
   FEN: NPO as hypoxic off face mask and evidence of aspiration with meds.
   Continue tube feeds via NGT. Unable to do formal speech/swallow consult
   and patient cannot tolerate being off face mask.

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with possible NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF
   and transferred to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   #. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  Hypoxia somewhat improved after aggressive diuresis. Has
   underlying COPD. Concern for pulmonary fibrosis, but CT chest showed
   severe emphysema and evidence of CHF,  not fibrosis. Also there is
   component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but PET scan does not
   seem consistent with this. CXR mildly improved with persistent R sided
   effusion. Given patient
s underlying emphysema, will treat as COPD
   exacerbation. The patient has been aggrerssively diuresed, and will
   slow down diuresis as UOP tapering off.
   - Continue ventimask at 80%, but try to wean down as tolerated.
   Non-invasive ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus
   OK to ventilate in case of respiratory failure
   - Continue solumedrol (3 days, then slow taper) and levaquin Day 2
   (total 5 days) today for possible BOOP vs. COP.
   - Hold Lasix
   - F/U sputum cultures and cytology.
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   #. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T peaked at 0.69.  Cardiology does not feel that
   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely
   ischemic in origin.
   - Continue with ASA and beta-blocker for now; no plavix or heparin per
   cardiology. F/U further cards recs.
   #. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; slowly trending downward
   to 2.0 today.  Etiology is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting
   troponin bump is possible.  Cr had been normalizing, but now increasing
   as UOP declines.
   - Follow daily serum Cr.
   #. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Pathology from
   [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy showed reactive lymph nodes, no tumor burden.
   Thoracic surgery aware patient is in house, will follow along. No
   contraindication to anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology will re-evaluate patient in several weeks when acute illness
   resolved; surgery still a possible option for consideration.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   #. Positive UTI: Given Cipro x 3 days. Urine culture negative, cipro
   d/c
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to aggressive diuresis with NPO status. On
   D5W with KCl replacement. Would prefer to give PO free water boluses.
   Given concern for aspiration, will place NGT today and start free water
   boluses.
   - Will hold off on more Lasix as patient clinically dry
   - Free water bolus via NG Tube.
   - Recheck lytes [**Hospital1 **].
   #. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   #. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic .
   - Hct stable at 30. Will continue to monitor.
   #. Depression.  Continue sertraline.
   FEN: NPO as hypoxic off face mask and evidence of aspiration with meds.
   Continue tube feeds via NGT. Unable to do formal speech/swallow consult
   and patient cannot tolerate being off face mask. Check fingersticks w/
   ISS while on solumedrol.
   ACCESS: 2 PIV
   PROPHYLAXIS: Heparin sc, bowel regimen. PPI.
   CODE: Full code; discussed with patient, HCP (wife [**Name (NI) **] and son [**Doctor Last Name 2381**]
   DISPO: PT for OOB, maybe late callout to the Floor today

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoker, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia. He has been transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe emphysema, as well as evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided pleural effusion. There is also a concern for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but a PET scan does not seem consistent with this.

The patient's current medications include solumedrol (3 days, then slow taper) and levaquin Day 2 (total 5 days) for possible bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) vs. COPD. Metoprolol is being given for rate and blood pressure control. Lasix has been held. Fasting blood glucose monitoring is being done while on solumedrol. The patient is also on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/66 mmHg to 129/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a venti mask. Physical examination reveals scattered dry crackles bilaterally, decreased breath sounds at the right lower lung base, warm extremities without edema, and cyanosis of bilateral fingers. The patient is alert and awake, resting with high flow mask on.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 287 K/uL, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, blood glucose of 185 mg/dL, sodium of 150 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, and troponin-T of 0.67 ng/mL. Other labs such as PT/INR/PTT, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, and lactic acid levels are within normal limits.

The patient's urine output has been decreasing, and he has developed hypernatremia likely due to aggressive diuresis with NPO status. The plan is to place a nasogastric tube (NGT) for free water boluses to correct the hypernatremia and provide nutritional support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening respiratory distress, development of infections due to immunosuppressive therapy, and possible cardiac events. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory parameters will be essential to manage these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is currently on prophylactic heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's sodium level remains high at 150 despite attempts to correct it with free water flushes. The patient's urine output is decreasing, so intravenous (IV) dextrose 5% in water (D5W) has been administered. The patient is doing well on an 80% ventimask and maintaining high oxygen saturation levels in the high 90s.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/66 mmHg to 129/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,205 mL, including 332 mL of total fluid (TF), 85 mL of tube feeding (TF), and 600 mL of intravenous fluid (IVF). Output consists of 1,560 mL of urine and 155 mL of nasogastric (NG) drainage, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 355 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a venti mask"

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF and
   transferred to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   #. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  Hypoxia somewhat improved after aggressive diuresis. Has
   underlying COPD. Concern for pulmonary fibrosis, but CT chest showed
   severe emphysema and evidence of CHF,  not fibrosis. Also there is
   component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but PET scan does not
   seem consistent with this. CXR mildly improved with persistent R sided
   effusion.  Episode this AM may have been poor [**Location (un) 103**] of O2 Sat monitor
   given rapid improvement, absence of tachypnea, and stable ABG; however,
   cyanotic fingers are somewhat concerning. Cyanosis resolved on later
   exam. Given patient
s underlying emphysema, will treat as COPD
   exacerbation and continue diuresis today.
   - Continue high flow mask vs face tent, wean down O2 as tolerated.
   Non-invasive ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus
   OK to ventilate in case of respiratory failure
   - Begin solumedrol and levaquin today for COPD exacerbation. Check
   fingersticks w/ ISS while on solumedrol.
   - IV Lasix 80mg x 1 for I/O goal -500-1L today.
   - F/U sputum cultures and cytology.
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   #. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T peaked at 0.69.  Cardiology does not feel that
   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely
   ischemic in origin.
   - Continue with ASA and beta-blocker for now; no plavix or heparin per
   cardiology. F/U further cards recs.
   #. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; slowly trending downward
   to 2.0 today.  Etiology is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting
   troponin bump is possible.  Cr continues to trend down.
   - Follow daily serum Cr.
   #. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Pathology from
   [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy showed reactive lymph nodes, no tumor burden.
   Thoracic surgery aware patient is in house, will follow along. No
   contraindication to anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology will re-evaluate patient in several weeks when acute illness
   resolved; surgery still a possible option for consideration.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   #. Positive UTI: Given Cipro x 3 days. Urine culture negative, cipro
   d/c
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to aggressive diuresis with NPO status. On
   D5W with KCl replacement. Would prefer to give PO free water boluses.
   Given concern for aspiration, will place NGT today and start free water
   boluses.
   - Free water bolus via NG Tube.
   - Recheck PM lytes.
   #. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   #. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic .
   - Hct stable at 30. Will continue to monitor.
   #. Depression.  Continue sertraline.
   FEN: NPO as hypoxic off face mask and evidence of aspiration with meds.
   Will place NGT today and begin tube feeds. Unable to do formal
   speech/swallow consult and patient cannot tolerate being off face mask.

","The patient is a 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoker, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia. He has been in the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has scattered dry crackles bilaterally, decreased breath sounds on the right lower base, and cyanosis of bilateral fingers. His laboratory results show anemia, elevated INR, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's underlying COPD and severe emphysema increase the risk of respiratory failure and worsening hypoxia.
2. Pulmonary edema: The presence of bilateral crackles and decreased breath sounds suggests possible pulmonary edema due to congestive heart failure (CHF).
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk of aspiration is increased due to his inability to tolerate being off the face mask, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability state increase the risk of DVT.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine indicates acute renal failure, which may be due to hypoperfusion or other underlying causes.

   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with possible NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF
   and transferred to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   #. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  Hypoxia somewhat improved after aggressive diuresis. Has
   underlying COPD. Concern for pulmonary fibrosis, but CT chest showed
   severe emphysema and evidence of CHF,  not fibrosis. Also there is
   component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but PET scan does not
   seem consistent with this. CXR mildly improved with persistent R sided
   effusion. Given patient

   exacerbation. The patient has been aggrerssively diuresed, and will
   slow down diuresis as UOP tapering off.

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoker, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He presented with possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia, and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF).

","Summary:
The patient, a 70-year-old male, is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they have a history of acute myocardial infarction. The patient has been transitioning from NC 4L to shovel mask. Hypernatremia is improving, but the patient is aspirating during medication administration, requiring further evaluation in the morning. The patient has no known drug allergies. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75/56 mmHg to 126/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has flat neck veins. Physical examination findings include scattered dry crackles bilaterally, decreased breath sounds at the right lung base, warm extremities with no edema, and radial pulses 2+ on the right side and 1+ on the left side.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelets (Plt). Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), bicarbonate (HCO3), and calcium (Ca) levels. Other lab values include elevated lactate, troponin-T, and cardiac enzymes, indicating possible myocardial"

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with possible NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF
   and transferred to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   .
   #. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  Hypoxia somewhat improved after aggressive diuresis. Has
   underlying COPD. Concern for pulmonary fibrosis, but CT chest showed
   severe emphysema and evidence of CHF,  not fibrosis. Also there is
   component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but PET scan does not
   seem consistent with this. CXR mildly improved with persistent R sided
   effusion. Given patient
s underlying emphysema, will treat as COPD
   exacerbation. The patient has been aggressively diuresed, and will slow
   down diuresis as UOP tapering off. Patient responded well to steroids,
   so likely inflammatory process.
   - Continue 4L NC and will try to wean down as tolerated. Non-invasive
   ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus OK to
   intubate in case of respiratory failure.
   - Continue solumedrol Day 2 (duration 3 days, then slow taper) and
   levaquin Day 3 (total 5 days) for possible BOOP vs. COP.
   - Hold Lasix
   - F/U sputum cultures and cytology.
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   #. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T peaked at 0.69.  Cardiology does not feel that
   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely
   ischemic in origin.
   - Continue with ASA and beta-blocker for now; no plavix or heparin per
   cardiology. F/U further cards recs.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; stable at 2.0.  Etiology
   is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting troponin bump is possible.
   Had positive UTI: Given Cipro x 3 days. Urine culture negative, cipro

   - Follow daily serum Cr.

   #. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Pathology from
   [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy showed reactive lymph nodes, no tumor burden.
   Thoracic surgery aware patient is in house, will follow along. No
   contraindication to anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology will re-evaluate patient in several weeks when acute illness
   resolved; surgery still a possible option for consideration.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist

   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to aggressive diuresis with NPO status.
   Given concern for aspiration, NGT todaywas placed and continues to get

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoking, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He presented with possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia, and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe emphysema, and evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). There is also a component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but the positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not seem consistent with this. The patient's condition has been improving, with some complications such as hypernatremia, acute renal failure, elevated INR, anemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient presented with worsening outpatient O2 requirement and acute worsening of hypoxia. He responded well to aggressive diuresis and will continue to be monitored.
2. NSTEMI: Troponin-T peaked at 0.69, indicating myocardial injury. The patient has a severely depressed ejection fraction (EF) and global hypokinesis, suggestive of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely ischemic in origin. The patient will continue with aspirin (ASA) and beta-blocker for now, and further cardiology recommendations will be followed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine ("

The patient's condition has been treated as a COPD exacerbation with non-invasive ventilation and diuretics. His troponin-T levels peaked at 0.69, indicating some cardiac damage, but cardiology does not feel that the patient currently has acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's renal function is impaired with a serum creatinine level of 2.0, and he has hypernatremia due to aggressive diuresis and NPO status. An NG tube has been placed to provide free water boluses and correct the hypernatremia. The patient's elevated INR is likely due to malnutrition, and his anemia is chronic and normocytic. He is also being treated for depression with sertraline. The patient's code status is full code, and he is being dispositioned to the floor for further care."

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with possible NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF
   and transferred to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   .
   #. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  Hypoxia somewhat improved after aggressive diuresis. Has
   underlying COPD. Concern for pulmonary fibrosis, but CT chest showed
   severe emphysema and evidence of CHF,  not fibrosis. Also there is
   component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but PET scan does not
   seem consistent with this. CXR mildly improved with persistent R sided
   effusion. Given patient
s underlying emphysema, will treat as COPD
   exacerbation. The patient has been aggressively diuresed, and will slow
   down diuresis as UOP tapering off. Patient responded well to steroids,
   so likely inflammatory process.
   - Continue 4L NC and will try to wean down as tolerated. Non-invasive
   ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus OK to
   intubate in case of respiratory failure.
   - Continue solumedrol Day 2 (duration 3 days, then slow taper) and
   levaquin Day 3 (total 5 days) for possible BOOP vs. COP.
   - Hold Lasix
   - F/U sputum cultures and cytology.
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   #. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T peaked at 0.69.  Cardiology does not feel that
   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely
   ischemic in origin.
   - Continue with ASA, statin and beta-blocker for now; no plavix or
   heparin per cardiology. F/U further cards recs.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; stable at 2.0.  Etiology
   is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting troponin bump is possible.
   Had positive UTI: Given Cipro x 3 days. Urine culture negative, cipro
   d/c
   - Follow daily serum Cr.
   .
   #. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Pathology from
   [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy showed reactive lymph nodes, no tumor burden.
   Thoracic surgery aware patient is in house, will follow along. No
   contraindication to anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology will re-evaluate patient in several weeks when acute illness
   resolved; surgery still a possible option for consideration.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   .
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to aggressive diuresis with NPO status.
   Given concern for aspiration, NGT was placed and continues to get free
   water boluses.
   - Will hold off on more Lasix as patient clinically dry
   - Free water bolus via NG Tube, titrate to correct hypernatremia, will
   increase free water flushes to 200cc q4hr
   - Recheck lytes [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   #. Elevated INR.  Normalizing. [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal
   limits which would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   .
   #. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic.
   - Hct stable at 30. Will continue to monitor.
   .
   #. Depression.  Continue sertraline.
   .
   FEN: NPO due to aspiration with meds
 will get S/S eval today.
   Continue tube feeds via NGT. Check fingersticks w/ ISS while on
   solumedrol
 will tighten up scale, PRN.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has been on supplemental oxygen and has shown improvement.
2. NSTEMI: Troponin-T levels peaked at 0.69, indicating some cardiac injury. Cardiology does not believe the patient is currently experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient will continue with aspirin and a beta-blocker for now, and further cardiology recommendations will be followed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine level was initially 1.6 but has increased to 2.0 today due to declining urine output. The etiology is unclear, but hypoperfusion related to the troponin bump is possible.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 148 mEq/L due to aggressive diuresis and NPO status. The plan is to give free water"

   Assessment and Plan
   86M with history of HTN, former smoker, and likely metastatic RCC who
   presented with possible NSTEMI and hypoxia, found to have depressed EF
   and transferred to ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   #. Hypoxia.  Has had increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few
   months with more acute worsening a few days ago.  Received
   pre-catheterization hydration and blood products in the setting of EF
   10-15%.  Hypoxia somewhat improved after aggressive diuresis. Has
   underlying COPD. Concern for pulmonary fibrosis, but CT chest showed
   severe emphysema and evidence of CHF,  not fibrosis. Also there is
   component for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but PET scan does not
   seem consistent with this. CXR mildly improved with persistent R sided
   effusion. Given patient
s underlying emphysema, will treat as COPD
   exacerbation. The patient has been aggrerssively diuresed, and will
   slow down diuresis as UOP tapering off.
   - Continue ventimask at 80%, but try to wean down as tolerated.
   Non-invasive ventilation as needed. Pt is full code at this time, thus
   OK to ventilate in case of respiratory failure
   - Continue solumedrol (3 days, then slow taper) and levaquin Day 2
   (total 5 days) today for possible BOOP vs. COP.
   - Hold Lasix
   - F/U sputum cultures and cytology.
   - Continue Metoprolol for rate and BP control
   - Would like to add ACEI given severely depressed EF though will defer
   given ARF
   .
   #. NSTEMI.  Troponin-T peaked at 0.69.  Cardiology does not feel that
   patient currently has ACS.  Severely depressed EF and global
   hypokinesis indicative of longer-standing cardiomyopathy, likely
   ischemic in origin.
   - Continue with ASA and beta-blocker for now; no plavix or heparin per
   cardiology. F/U further cards recs.
   #. Acute renal failure.  SCr in [**2-17**] was 1.6; slowly trending downward
   to 2.0 today.  Etiology is unclear though hypoperfusion in setting
   troponin bump is possible.  Cr had been normalizing, but now increasing
   as UOP declines.
   - Follow daily serum Cr.
   #. Renal Mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC.  Pathology from
   [**3-7**] mediastinoscopy showed reactive lymph nodes, no tumor burden.
   Thoracic surgery aware patient is in house, will follow along. No
   contraindication to anticoagulation currently.
   - Urology will re-evaluate patient in several weeks when acute illness
   resolved; surgery still a possible option for consideration.
   - Discuss with outpatient oncologist
   #. Positive UTI: Given Cipro x 3 days. Urine culture negative, cipro
   d/c
   #. Hypernatremia: Likely due to aggressive diuresis with NPO status. On
   D5W with KCl replacement. Would prefer to give PO free water boluses.
   Given concern for aspiration, will place NGT today and start free water
   boluses.
   - Will hold off on more Lasix as patient clinically dry
   - Free water bolus via NG Tube.
   - Recheck lytes [**Hospital1 **].
   #. Elevated INR.  [**Month (only) 11**] be nutritional.  LFTs within normal limits which
   would argue against liver involvement of tumor.
   #. Anemia.  Chronic and normocytic .
   - Hct stable at 30. Will continue to monitor.
   #. Depression.  Continue sertraline.
   FEN: NPO as hypoxic off face mask and evidence of aspiration with meds.
   Continue tube feeds via NGT. Unable to do formal speech/swallow consult
   and patient cannot tolerate being off face mask. Check fingersticks w/
   ISS while on solumedrol.
   ACCESS: 2 PIV
   PROPHYLAXIS: Heparin sc, bowel regimen. PPI.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, former smoking, and likely metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). He presented with possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and hypoxia, leading to transfer to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe emphysema, with evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) on imaging. There is also a concern for lymphangitic spread of renal tumor, but a positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not seem consistent with this. The patient has been aggressively diuresed, and his urine output is improving. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation and receiving solumedrol and levaquin for possible bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) versus COPD exacerbation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia require close monitoring and management. Non-invasive ventilation may be continued as tolerated, and the possibility of intubation should be considered if respiratory failure occurs.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin-T levels peaked at 0.69, indicating some cardiac injury. However, cardiology does not feel that the patient currently has acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The severely depressed ejection fraction (EF) and global hypokinesis suggest"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of COPD, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and NSTEMI. He was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient has shown dynamic improvement in oxygenation, likely due to infection and diffuse inflammatory process. He is off invasive ventilatory support but has ongoing issues with intermittent aspiration. The patient has hypovolemia and is being treated for CHF and myocardial ischemia, as well as acute renal failure. He also has hypernatremia and impaired skin integrity. The patient's medical issues include respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and altered nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure could potentially worsen if there is a recurrence of aspiration or if his underlying COPD exacerbates.
2. CHF and Myocardial Ischemia: The patient's heart condition could deteriorate if he does not receive proper treatment and management for CHF and myocardial ischemia.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate if he is not adequately hydrated and if nephrotoxic medications are administered.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's electrolyte imbalance could lead to further complications if not corrected promptly.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedso"
