","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). She presented initially with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and was transferred for atrial flutter ablation. Complications include hypoxia and anasarca.

The patient has multiple medical issues including COPD, HAP, CHF, atrial flutter, open AAA repair, cholecystectomy, ventral hernia repair, severe PVD, and CAD. She is currently experiencing dyspnea/hypoxia, pump failure, rhythm disturbances, abdominal pain/distension/diarrhea, pneumonia, severe PVD, CAD, femoral arterial occlusion, and poor glycemic control.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Multifactorial, likely due to COPD, CHF, and pneumonia.
- Treat COPD with Advair 500/50 INH, Atrovent Neb q6H, and Xopenex nebs prn.
- Treat HAP with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.
- Diurese aggressively.
2. Pump Failure: Patient is volume overloaded and needs aggressive diuresis.
- Continue Lasix gtt.
- Consider dobutamine if BP won't tolerate Lasix g"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), who presented initially with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient was transferred for atrial flutter ablation but experienced complications such as hypoxia and anasarca.

The patient's current condition includes dyspnea/hypoxia, pump dysfunction, rhythm disturbances, abdominal pain/distension/diarrhea, pneumonia, severe PVD, CAD, and femoral venous efficiency (FEN). The patient is currently on several medications including Advair, atrovent, xopenex, vanc, zosyn, lasix, dobutamine, Lopressor, digoxin, amiodarone, lovenox, and ASA.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure due to dyspnea/hypoxia and pneumonia.
2. Cardiac failure due to pump dysfunction and history of CHF.
3. Arrhythmias due to atrial flutter and history of CAD.
4. Gastrointestinal issues such as abdominal pain, distension, and diarrhea due to recent surgeries and possible C. difficile infection.
5. Peripheral vascular disease leading to decreased perfusion and potential for embolic phenomena.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. She presented to the emergency department with an exacerbation of CHF and was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has been experiencing worsening hypoxia and anasarca (generalized swelling). Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 86/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 495 mL and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2 of 75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

Physical examination reveals generalized swelling, tachypnea, and crackles in the lungs bilaterally. The patient's abdomen is soft and distended with tenderness to palpation. She has decreased perfusion in the right foot and evidence of embolic phenomenon on the left dorsal foot. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 76 yo female with CAD, s/p AAA, PVD, CRI, who initially
   presented to OSH with CHF exacerbation, transferred from OSH for a.
   flutter ablation and course complication by hypoxia and anasarca.
   .
   #. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Worsening hypoxia, likely from work of breathing.
   Primary process thought to be volume overload with component of COPD.
   Pneumonia appears likely giving evolving infiltrate on CXR.  Also has
   known diaphragmatic hemiparesis.  Patient appears unlikely to be able
   to wean from vent if intubated and would likely be trach dependent,
   which is clearly against her wishes.  Patient has expressed multiple
   times in clear mindset that she does not wish to be intubated but that
   she will defer this descision to her daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] daughter wishes for
   a trial of intubation.  PE unlikely on argatroban.
   -ethics consult regarding conflicting directives from patient and HCP
   -CPAP as necessary.  Might need intubation if acutely decompensating.
   -Treating COPD with Advair 500/50 INH [**Hospital1 **], atrovent Neb q6H, continue
   xopenex nebs prn.   No steroids as not wheezing on exam.
   -Treat HAP with vanc/zosyn.  Worsening WBC raises suspicion for ESBL,
   however, afebrile presently
   -Aggressive diuresis with goal -2L
   -Daily CXR
   .
   #. Pump: Pt volume overloaded admission but now s/p aggressive
   diuresis. Echo on this hospitalization shows EF 30%
   - Lasix gtt, will back down with goal -500cc to -1L
   .
   #. CAD: Patient has a history of severe three vessel disease s/p CABG.
   -holding BB given hypotension
   -continue asa
   -no statin [**12-27**] elevated LFTs
   .
   #. Rhythm: Patient has a history of atrial flutter, s/p cardioversion.
   Initial plan was for ablation however given other medical issues at
   this time, holding.
   -Continue digoxin and amiodarone.
   -Check Dig levels after 4th dose
   -Switch to lovenox.  Send HIT [**Doctor First Name **] and Ab tests.
   .
   #. Abdominal Pain/Distension/Diarrhea: Patient has a history of open
   AAA repair, cholecystectomy and ventral hernia repair recently. C. Diff
   negative x3 but completing course of PO Vanc. CT abdomen shows occluded

   #. Severe PVD: History of AAA open repair. Patient has decreased

   dorsal foot.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), who presented initially with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. She was transferred from the operating room (OSH) for a flutter ablation due to atrial flutter and has since developed complications such as hypoxia and anasarca.

The patient is currently intubated on CPAP with worsening respiratory status, with oxygen saturation levels in the 80s. She has expressed her wish not to be intubated but has deferred the decision to her daughter. The daughter wishes for a trial of intubation. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure of 86/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and temperature of 35.2°C. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles and rhonchi, cool right foot, petechiae on the left foot, and bruising on the bilateral hands and arms.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/mm³, decreased hemoglobin at 10.1 g/dL, elevated lactate levels at 1.2 mmol/L, and prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) at 27.1/2.7. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but magnesium levels are slightly elevated at 2.5 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal evolving opacification in the right middle lobe consistent with pneumonia, bilateral edema, and occluded mesenteric artery.

The patient's medical conditions include severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial flutter, open AAA repair, ventral hernia repair, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). The patient's current medications include digoxin, amiodarone, furosemide, heparin-free triple lumen catheter, and others.

The patient's plan includes aggressive diuresis, treatment for COPD exacerbation, management of atrial flutter, and addressing abdominal pain and distension. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the critical care unit (CCU)."
