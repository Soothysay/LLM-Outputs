   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo male with a history of stage IV colon cancer s/p multiple
   surgeries now s/p right colectomy and end ileostomy secondary to
   perforation.
   # Shock: Patient was found to have perforation of his bowel, now s/p
   septic from ischemic colon after surgery.  The patient has been
   adequated fluid resusitated (his CVPs have been ranging from [**8-15**]) and
   is s/p 2 units of PRBC with a stable Hct of 36 this am.  His UOP over
   the past few hours has been good.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr.  Can continue to wean levophed
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn per surgery.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Will follow up surgery recs.
   # Respiratory support:  The patient remained intubated after his
   colectomy.
   - Continue ventilatory support, attempting to wean once off pressors
   and more stable.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Patient has a borderline non-anion gap acidosis
   likely due to a combination of lactic acidosis (elevated lactate at 3.0
   this am) and a hyperchloremic non-gap acidosis from the amount of NS he
   received.
   - If IVF needed consider using LR instead or NS.
   # Stage IV colon cancer:  The patient had received chemo/XRT previously
   and had undergo liver resection [**2161-1-9**] for a possible met for which the
   patholgy showed no evidence of cancer.
   # FEN: NPO for now, replete electrolytes prn

   51 yo male with a history of stage IV colon cancer s/p multiple
   surgeries now s/p right colectomy and end ileostomy secondary to
   perforation.
   # Shock: Patient was found to have perforation of his bowel, now s/p
   septic from ischemic colon after surgery.  The patient has been
   adequated fluid resusitated (his CVPs have been ranging from [**8-15**]) and
   is s/p 2 units of PRBC with a stable Hct of 36 this am.  His UOP over
   the past few hours has been good.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr.  Can continue to wean levophed
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn per surgery.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Will follow up surgery recs.
   # Respiratory support:  The patient remained intubated after his
   colectomy.
   - Continue ventilatory support, attempting to wean once off pressors
   and more stable.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Patient has a borderline non-anion gap acidosis
   likely due to a combination of lactic acidosis (elevated lactate at 3.0
   this am) and a hyperchloremic non-gap acidosis from the amount of NS he
   received.
   - If IVF needed consider using LR instead or NS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon cancer who underwent right colectomy and end ileostomy due to perforation. He is currently in the ICU for septic shock following surgery. The patient has been adequately fluid resuscitated, received 2 units of PRBC, and is stable with a Hct of 36. His UOP has been good. He remains intubated on CMV and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco and Zosyn). Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient's WBC count fever curve will be trended. The surgical team will provide further recommendations. The patient's respiratory support will continue, attempting to wean off pressors and become more stable. Metabolic acidosis is present, likely due to lactic acidosis and hyperchloremic non-gap acidosis from NS administration. IVF should consider using LR instead of NS. The patient had previous chemotherapy and liver resection for possible metastasis, but pathology showed no evidence of cancer. The patient is NPO, and electrolytes will be repleted as needed. Access is through LJI, and prophylaxis includes pneumoboots, heparin sub-q, and PPI. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is ICU. The medical ICU team will be available as needed.

","The patient is a middle-aged male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock due to ischemic colon, stage IV colon cancer, and previous chemotherapy and liver resection. The patient is intubated, receiving mechanical ventilation, and has multiple arterial lines, a multi-lumen catheter, and an indwelling port for chemotherapy.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F) with a current temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F). The patient is on midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management, respectively.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.8 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 3.0 mmol/L, low platelet count of 1137 K/uL, and elevated troponin I levels at 7.42. The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 36 mg/dL and creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 128 mEq/L, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L, and elevated chloride levels at 104 mEq/L.

The patient's urine output is low at 176 mL over the last 24 hours. The patient's blood cultures are pending, as well as urine culture, MRSA screen, and wound culture.

The patient is being treated for septic shock with IV fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressor support. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within the target range of 8-12 mmHg, and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is above 65 mmHg. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is below 30%.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Persistent septic shock: The patient's condition may worsen if the underlying infection is not adequately controlled or if there is a delay in identifying the causative organism.
2. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): The patient's impaired renal function and elevated lactate levels indicate potential organ dysfunction. Further deterioration in organ function could lead to MODS.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest AKI. Continued renal dysfunction could require dialysis.
4. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing pneumonia due to mechanical ventilation and the presence of an endotracheal tube.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo male with a history of stage IV colon cancer s/p multiple
   surgeries now s/p right colectomy and end ileostomy secondary to
   perforation.
   # Shock: Patient was found to have perforation of his bowel, now s/p
   septic from ischemic colon after surgery.  The patient has been
   adequated fluid resusitated (his CVPs have been ranging from [**8-15**]) and
   is s/p 2 units of PRBC with a stable Hct of 36 this am.  His UOP over
   the past few hours has been good.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr.  Can continue to wean levophed
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn per surgery.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Will follow up surgery recs.
   # Respiratory support:  The patient remained intubated after his
   colectomy.
   - Continue ventilatory support, attempting to wean once off pressors
   and more stable.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Patient has a borderline non-anion gap acidosis
   likely due to a combination of lactic acidosis (elevated lactate at 3.0
   this am) and a hyperchloremic non-gap acidosis from the amount of NS he
   received.
   - If IVF needed consider using LR instead or NS.
   # Stage IV colon cancer:  The patient had received chemo/XRT previously
   and had undergo liver resection [**2161-1-9**] for a possible met for which the
   patholgy showed no evidence of cancer.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon cancer who underwent a right colectomy and end ileostomy due to bowel perforation. The patient has been experiencing septic shock secondary to ischemic colon after surgery.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 84/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal ventilation. The patient's CVP is ranging from 8-15 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, HCO3 of 99 mEq/L, and a base excess of -2. These values suggest a borderline non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactic acidosis and hyperchloremic non-gap acidosis from the administration of normal saline (NS).

The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 24.8 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 3.0 mmol/L, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 104 mEq/L. Other lab results, including kidney function tests, liver function tests, and electroly"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo male with a history of stage IV colon cancer s/p multiple
   surgeries now s/p right colectomy and end ileostomy secondary to
   perforation.
   # Shock: Patient was found to have perforation of his bowel, now s/p
   septic from ischemic colon after surgery.  The patient has been
   adequated fluid resusitated (his CVPs have been ranging from [**8-15**]) and
   is s/p 2 units of PRBC with a stable Hct of 36 this am.  His UOP over
   the past few hours has been good.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr.  Can continue to wean levophed
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with vanc and zosyn per surgery.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Will follow up surgery recs.
   # Respiratory support:  The patient remained intubated after his
   colectomy.
   - Continue ventilatory support, attempting to wean once off pressors
   and more stable.
   # Metabolic acidosis: Patient has a borderline non-anion gap acidosis
   likely due to a combination of lactic acidosis (elevated lactate at 3.0
   this am) and a hyperchloremic non-gap acidosis from the amount of NS he
   received.
   - If IVF needed consider using LR instead or NS.
   # Stage IV colon cancer:  The patient had received chemo/XRT previously
   and had undergo liver resection [**2161-1-9**] for a possible met for which the
   patholgy showed no evidence of cancer.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of stage IV colon cancer who recently underwent a right colectomy and ileostomy due to bowel perforation. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock caused by ischemic colon following surgery. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), a heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilatory support. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2 of 248 mmHg, and a base excess of -2. The patient's lactic acid level is elevated at 3.0 mmol/L, indicating lactic acidosis. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 24.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.9%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 1418, and slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.1. Blood cultures, urine culture, and MRSA screen are pending. 

The patient has been adequately fluid-resuscitated, with central venous pressure (CVP) ranging from 8-15 mmHg. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and has a stable hematocrit (Hct) of 36%. The patient's urine output (UOP) over the past few hours has been good. 

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam), as well as vancomycin. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include: 

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock due to ischemic colon following surgery. Continued monitoring and management of sepsis are crucial. 

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting ventilation settings as needed is essential.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated platelet count may indicate a coagulopathy. Monitoring for bleeding tendencies and coagulation abnormalities is necessary.

5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a borderline non-anion"

   51 yo male s/p proctectomy and re-anastamosis with diverting ileostomy
   and now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] post ileostomy takedown.  He was extubated but
   has required intermittent ventilatory support through mask ventilation
   in the setting of intermittent hypoxemia.  This is in part likely
   attributable to pulmonary edema but may well be in part slow to resolve
   atelectasis and residual secretions.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Maintain negative fluid balance as possible
   -Intermittent BIPAP mask ventilation as needed
   -Would encouage cough and maintain pain control as needed to allow full
   pulmonary toilet
   -Incetive spirometry as possible with hypoxemia and respiratory
   compromise
   -OOB to chair as soon as possible.
   Additional active issues to be addressed as defined in the surgery note

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 51-year-old male who underwent a proctectomy and re-anastomosis with diverting ileostomy, followed by admission to the ICU after ileostomy takedown. The patient was extubated but required intermittent ventilatory support through mask ventilation due to intermittent hypoxemia, which may be attributed to pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and residual secretions. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm). The current assessment indicates respiratory failure, with plans to maintain a negative fluid balance, provide intermittent BIPAP mask ventilation as needed, encourage coughing, maintain pain control for pulmonary toilet, and use incentive spirometry as possible. The patient also has pulmonary edema and a history of cancer. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and various lines and prophylaxis measures. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if there is inadequate ventilation or oxygenation, leading to further hypoxemia or hypercapnia. This could result in increased work of breathing, fatigue, and potentially cardiac complications.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may progress if fluid balance is not maintained properly or if cardiac function deteriorates. This could lead to worsening oxygenation, increased pulmonary pressures, and potentially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of metastatic colon cancer, who underwent an urgent partial colectomy with end ileostomy and Hartmann's pouch. He was admitted to the ICU postoperatively with issues of respiratory failure, volume overload, and continued management of peritonitis/wound infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/72 mmHg to 96/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been weaned off the mask ventilation.

The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide (Lasix) at 2 mg/hour, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), famotidine (Pepcid), and other ICU medications. He has also been receiving antibiotics such as vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are within normal range, while his potassium and sodium levels are slightly low. His liver function tests are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of metastatic colon cancer who underwent an urgent partial colectomy with end ileostomy and Hartmann's pouch due to complications from ileostomy take down and small bowel obstruction. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU post-operatively with issues of respiratory failure, volume overload, and continued management of peritonitis/wound infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen and has persistent atelectasis, which may increase the risk of pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and weaning off oxygen as tolerated will be necessary.

2. Volume Overload: The patient has an increased fluid balance, indicated by a positive fluid balance of 1,055 mL over the past 24 hours. This could contribute to congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema. Diuretic therapy may be required to manage fluid overload and maintain a target central venous pressure (CVP) of 5-6.

3. Sepsis/Peritonitis: The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole) for suspected sepsis and peritonitis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to assess response to antibiotics and identify any signs of septic shock.

4. Colon Cancer: The patient has a history of metastatic colon"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 51-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU post-operatively with respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's respiratory status and hemodynamics have improved following extubation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 123/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of allergies to shellfish-derived products, nausea/vomiting, and a medical history of malignancy (malignant neoplasm). The patient's family history and review of systems are unchanged from admission except where noted above.

The patient is currently receiving several medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole), lorazepam, famotidine, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (34.3 - 37.3 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (9.8 g/dL), slightly elevated sodium (139 mEq/L), and normal potassium levels (3.5 mEq/L). Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient was initially admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. Although the patient's respiratory status has improved"
