   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3375**] is a 53 year old male with PMH of chronic vent/trach, severe
   COPD, prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, and recent admission
   for VAP who presents from rehab after being found unresponsive
   overnight.
   # Unresponsiveness - Currently of unclear etiology, although
   differential includes infection in the setting of hypotension and
   leukocytosis vs mucus plugging, hypercapnia, or drug related
   (specifically oxycodone).  Also cannot rule out seizure. It is possible
   that he may have aspirated in this setting and developed aspiration
   pneumonitis versus pneumonia.  Alternatively given an absence of CXR
   findings, a source of infection may be his PICC line.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation and wean as tolerated.  ABC in
   ED 7.36/60/78 - appears to be baseline CO2.
   - Treat for possible PNA with tobramycin, bactrim and cefepime.  Added
   vanco for additional gram positive coverage.
   - d/c PICC line and send tip for culture
   - sputum culture
   - CE negative x2.
   - Follow WBC count and fever curve.
   - Continue current seizure medications
   - get 24 hour EEG
   - consider neuro consult in AM
   - Continue to follow cultures
   # Hypotension: Systolic BP 70s at rehab and on arrival to ED.  Per last
   d/c summary patient had multiple episodes of hypotension to SBP 70s
   during last admission attributed to sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Differential includes sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, dehydration
   (increased hct and creatinine which may point to dehydration), or
   autonomic instability.
   - Treat possible PNA with broad spectrum antibiotics as above.  Follow
   culture data
   - Continue with IV hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency.
   - Continue to hold home diltiazem and lasix
   - bolus IVF as needed, would tolerate a lower BP id he is mentating and
   making urine
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infection versus steroid induced.
   - WBC this AM was 8.4 with continued left shift. Continue to [**Last Name (un) 3379**] WBC.
   - Continue with steroids
   - PICC line pulled with tip culture pending.
   - d/c femoral line and get new PICC line placed pending negative blood
   cultures
   # Acute renal failure: b/l 0.2-0.3, 0.5 on presentation which may be
   acute renal failure for him.
   - Renal function back to baseline with AM creatinine of 0.2.
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-27.  Hct on admission was 32.3, again may
   point towards decreased volume status as etiology of hypotension.
   # Right leg pain: He had had this pain for several years, it is
   unchanged and he is on chronic narcotics. On exam no evidence of edema
   or tenderness
   - continue pains meds, but hold for sedation
   # Recent history of suicidal ideation during last admission was
   followed by psychiatry and had 1:1 sitter.  Pt denies any suicidal or
   homocidal ideation currently.
   - Continue with home psychiatric medications.
   # Diabetes mellitus: Elevated BG last admission in setting of steroid
   use.
   - Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   - Consider insulin drip if hyperglycemic.
   # Seizure disorder:
   - Continue outpatient dose of levetiracetam 250 mg PO BID, divalproex
   875 mg TID
   - consider neuro consult EEG
   # Schizophrenia:
   - Continue outpatient dose of risperidone
   # F/E/N: Tube feeds via PEG
   - Monitor lytes and replete PRN
   # PPx: proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis, SC
   heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   # Access: Right femoral line.  Plan to order PICC placement so that
   femoral line can be pulled.

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic ventilation and tracheostomy, severe COPD, prior left cerebral vascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient presents from a rehabilitation center after being found unresponsive overnight.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, unresponsiveness, leukocytosis, possible pneumonia, and potential seizure activity. The patient is mechanically ventilated and receiving antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. The PICC line has been discontinued, and cultures are pending. The patient's seizure medications have been continued, and a 24-hour EEG is planned. A neurology consultation is also being considered.

The patient's recent medical history includes episodes of hypotension attributed to sepsis versus adrenal insufficiency. He is being treated for possible pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics and receiving IV hydrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency. Dehydration and autonomic instability are also considered as potential causes of hypotension.

The patient has leukocytosis likely due to infection or steroid-induced. His renal function has improved from acute renal failure, with an AM creatinine of 0.2. Anemia is present, possibly due to decreased volume status. The patient has chronic right leg pain, but no evidence of edema or tenderness on examination.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic ventilation, severe COPD, prior left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He presents from rehabilitation after being found unresponsive overnight. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder, schizophrenia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness could be due to various causes such as infection, stress reaction, mucus plugging, hypercapnia, drug-related effects (specifically oxycodone), or seizure. The absence of chest X-ray findings suggests that the source of infection may be his peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient is being treated for possible pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics and additional gram-positive coverage. Cultures are pending, and seizure medications are being continued.
2. Hypotension: The patient has a history of multiple episodes of hypotension during his last admission, which were attributed to sepsis versus adrenal insufficiency. The differential diagnosis for his current hypotension includes sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, dehydration, or autonomic instability. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and IV hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency.
3. Leukocytosis: The"

   3. Hypotension - fluid responsive, pressure now stable
   3.? Infection - Cefopime/Tobra/Vanco/Bactrim to cover broadly for
   resistant gm negatives, ? MRSA
                           Lung source is most probable, urine appears
   clean, no localizing signs elsewhere
                           Could be catheter related - pull PICC with fem
   in place and replace PICC in 24h
   4. Adrenal Insufficiency - on stress doses of steroids
   5. s/p CVA - not active
   6. Hx of Seizures - continue on current seizure meds
                                  Consider Neuro Consult to address
   possible break thru seizures
   7. Schizophrenia - continue psych meds

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3375**] is a 53 year old male with PMH of chronic vent/trach, severe
   COPD, prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, and recent admission
   for VAP who presents from rehab after being found unresponsive
   overnight.
   # Hypotension: Systolic BP 70s at rehab and on arrival to ED.
   Continues to have SBP intermitently in the 90
   - Treat possible PNA with broad spectrum antibiotics as above.  Follow
   culture data.
   - Continue with IV hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency.
   - Continue to hold home diltiazem and lasix.
   - Continue to bolus IVF as needed.
   # PICC line
 placement by IR possibly today, but likely Monday.
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infection versus steroid induced.
   - WBC this AM was 5.4. Continue to trend CBC
   - Continue with steroids
   - d/c femoral line when PICC placed.
   # Acute renal failure: b/l 0.2-0.3, 0.5 on presentation which may be
   acute renal failure for him.
   - AM creatinine of 0.4, continue to trend
   - Oliguric overnight, IVF bolus as necessary.
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-27.  Hct on admission was 32.3, again may
   point towards decreased volume status as etiology of hypotension.
   Currently 27.6.
   # Right leg pain: He had this pain for several years, it is unchanged
   and he is on chronic narcotics. On exam no evidence of edema or
   tenderness
   - continue pains meds, but hold for sedation
   # Recent history of suicidal ideation during last admission was
   followed by psychiatry and had 1:1 sitter.  Pt denies any suicidal or
   homocidal ideation currently.
   - Continue with home psychiatric medications.
   # Diabetes mellitus: Elevated BG last admission in setting of steroid
   use.
   - FS between 100-200.
   - Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   - Consider insulin drip if hyperglycemic.
   # Constipation:
   - Standing lactulose PRN, also receiving colase and senna.
   # Seizure disorder:
   - Continue outpatient dose of levetiracetam 250 mg PO BID, divalproex
   875 mg TID
   - consider neuro consult EEG
   # Schizophrenia:
   - Continue outpatient dose of risperidone
   # F/E/N: Tube feeds via PEG
   - Monitor lytes and replete PRN
   # PPx: proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis, SC
   heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   # Access: Right femoral line.  Plan to order PICC placement so that
   femoral line can be pulled.
   # Communication: Guardian [**Name (NI) 149**] [**Name (NI) 3322**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3316**], fax

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is unresponsiveness. The patient has a history of chronic ventilator/tracheostomy, severe COPD, prior left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s at the rehabilitation facility and upon arrival to the emergency department. The patient's heart rate is within normal range, respiratory rate is slightly decreased, and oxygen saturation is at 96%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 288 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and a slightly low hemoglobin level. The patient also has hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 154 mg/dL.

The patient has several medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, anemia, acute renal failure, and possible adrenal insufficiency. The patient is also taking multiple medications including hydrocortisone, antibiotics, and chronic narcotics for right leg pain.

The patient's plan of care includes treating possible pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics, continuing IV hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency, holding home diltiazem and lasix, and continuing to bolus intravenous fluids as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration of renal function, development"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3375**] is a 53 year old male with PMH of chronic vent/trach, severe
   COPD, prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, and recent admission
   for VAP who presents from rehab after being found unresponsive
   overnight.
   # Unresponsiveness - Currently of unclear etiology, although
   differential includes infection in the setting of hypotension and
   leukocytosis vs mucus plugging, hypercapnia, or drug related
   (specifically oxycodone).  Also cannot rule out seizure. It is possible
   that he may have aspirated in this setting and developed aspiration
   pneumonitis versus pneumonia.  Alternatively given an absence of CXR
   findings, a source of infection may be his PICC line.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, currently at baseline vent
   settings.
   - Treat for possible PNA with tobramycin, bactrim and cefepime.  Added
   vanco for additional gram positive coverage
   # Hypotension: Systolic BP 70s at rehab and on arrival to ED.  Per last
   d/c summary patient had multiple episodes of hypotension to SBP 70s
   during last admission attributed to sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Differential includes sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, dehydration
   (increased hct and creatinine which may point to dehydration), or
   autonomic instability.
   - Treat possible PNA with broad spectrum antibiotics as above.  Follow
   culture data.
   - Continue with IV hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency.
   - Continue to hold home diltiazem and lasix.
   - Continue to bolus IVF as needed.
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infection versus steroid induced.
   - WBC this AM was 5.4. Continue to trend CBC
   - Continue with steroids
   - d/c femoral line when PICC placed.
   # Acute renal failure: b/l 0.2-0.3, 0.5 on presentation which may be
   acute renal failure for him.
   - AM creatinine of 0.4, continue to trend
   - Oliguric overnight, IVF bolus as necessary.
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-27.  Hct on admission was 32.3, again may
   point towards decreased volume status as etiology of hypotension.
   Currently 27.6.
   # Right leg pain: He had this pain for several years, it is unchanged
   and he is on chronic narcotics. On exam no evidence of edema or
   tenderness
   - continue pains meds, but hold for sedation
   # Recent history of suicidal ideation during last admission was
   followed by psychiatry and had 1:1 sitter.  Pt denies any suicidal or
   homocidal ideation currently.
   - Continue with home psychiatric medications.
   # Diabetes mellitus: Elevated BG last admission in setting of steroid
   use.
   - FS between 100-200.
   - Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   - Consider insulin drip if hyperglycemic.
   # Seizure disorder:
   - Continue outpatient dose of levetiracetam 250 mg PO BID, divalproex
   875 mg TID
   - consider neuro consult EEG
   # Schizophrenia:
   - Continue outpatient dose of risperidone
   # F/E/N: Tube feeds via PEG
   - Monitor lytes and replete PRN
   # PPx: proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis, SC
   heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   # Access: Right femoral line.  Plan to order PICC placement so that
   femoral line can be pulled.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic ventilator/tracheostomy, severe COPD, previous left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He presents from rehabilitation after being found unresponsive overnight. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on several medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unresponsiveness: The patient's current unresponsiveness may be due to various causes such as infection, mucus plugging, hypercapnia, drug-related effects (specifically oxycodone), or seizure activity. It is also possible that he may have aspirated and developed aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia. Additionally, the PICC line could be a potential source of infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure in the 70s at rehab and on arrival to the emergency department suggests potential causes like sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, dehydration, or autonomic instability.
3. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may be due to infection or steroid-induced effects.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the reduced creatinine levels.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels suggest chronic anemia, which may be related to decreased volume status.
6. Right leg pain: The patient has a history of chronic leg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic vent/trach, severe COPD, prior left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He presents from a rehabilitation facility after being found unresponsive overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has had low systolic blood pressure readings in the 70s at the rehabilitation facility and upon arrival to the emergency department. His current blood pressure is intermittently in the 90s. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia, hydrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency, holding home medications diltiazem and lasix, and providing intravenous fluids as needed.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be due to infection or steroid-induced. It is important to continue monitoring the complete blood count (CBC) and to continue with steroid treatment.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has low creatinine levels bilaterally, indicating a possible acute renal failure. Monitoring of creatinine levels and providing intravenous fluids as necessary are recommended.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is low, which may be related to decreased volume status contributing to hypotension. The Hct level is currently at 27.6, indicating ongoing monitoring is required.

5. Right leg pain: The patient has chronic leg pain, but examination shows no evidence of edema or tenderness. The patient is on chronic narcotics for pain management. It is important to continue pain medication while avoiding sedation.

6. Recent history of suicidal ideation: The patient had a previous admission where he experienced suicidal thoughts and received psychiatric intervention. Currently, he denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation. Continuing with home psychiatric medications is recommended.

7. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, particularly during steroid use. Management includes administering glargine and insulin sliding scale, and considering an insulin drip if hyperglycemia persists.

8. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation and is receiving lactulose, colace, and senna as part of the treatment plan.

9. Seizure disorder: The patient is on outpatient doses of levetiracetam and divalproex for seizure management. Considering a neurology consult and an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be beneficial.

10. Schizophrenia: The patient is on risperidone for schizophrenia management.

11. Feeding and nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

12. Prophylaxis measures: The patient is on proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

13. Access: The patient currently has a right femoral line, which will be replaced"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3375**] is a 53 year old male with PMH of chronic vent/trach, severe
   COPD, prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, and recent admission
   for VAP who presents from rehab after being found unresponsive
   overnight.
   # Unresponsiveness - Currently of unclear etiology, although
   differential includes infection in the setting of hypotension and
   leukocytosis vs mucus plugging, hypercapnia, or drug related
   (specifically oxycodone).  Also cannot rule out seizure. It is possible
   that he may have aspirated in this setting and developed aspiration
   pneumonitis versus pneumonia.  Alternatively given an absence of CXR
   findings, a source of infection may be his PICC line.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, currently at baseline vent
   settings.
   - Treat for possible PNA with tobramycin, bactrim and cefepime.  Added
   vanco for additional gram positive coverage
   # Hypotension: Systolic BP 70s at rehab and on arrival to ED.  Per last
   d/c summary patient had multiple episodes of hypotension to SBP 70s
   during last admission attributed to sepsis vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Differential includes sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, dehydration
   (increased hct and creatinine which may point to dehydration), or
   autonomic instability.
   - Treat possible PNA with broad spectrum antibiotics as above.  Follow
   culture data.
   - Continue with IV hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency.
   - Continue to hold home diltiazem and lasix.
   - Continue to bolus IVF as needed.
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infection versus steroid induced.
   - WBC this AM was 5.4. Continue to trend CBC
   - Continue with steroids
   - d/c femoral line when PICC placed.
   # Acute renal failure: b/l 0.2-0.3, 0.5 on presentation which may be
   acute renal failure for him.
   - AM creatinine of 0.4, continue to trend
   - Oliguric overnight, IVF bolus as necessary.
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-27.  Hct on admission was 32.3, again may
   point towards decreased volume status as etiology of hypotension.
   Currently 27.6.
   # Right leg pain: He had this pain for several years, it is unchanged
   and he is on chronic narcotics. On exam no evidence of edema or
   tenderness
   - continue pains meds, but hold for sedation
   # Recent history of suicidal ideation during last admission was
   followed by psychiatry and had 1:1 sitter.  Pt denies any suicidal or
   homocidal ideation currently.
   - Continue with home psychiatric medications.
   # Diabetes mellitus: Elevated BG last admission in setting of steroid
   use.
   - FS between 100-200.
   - Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   - Consider insulin drip if hyperglycemic.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic ventilator/tracheostomy, severe COPD, prior left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient was found unresponsive overnight. The differential diagnosis includes infection (possibly related to hypotension and leukocytosis), mucus plugging with hypercapnia, drug-related causes (such as oxycodone), or seizure.

The patient has been treated with mechanical ventilation at baseline settings. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (tobramycin, bactrim, and cefepime) have been added, along with vancomycin for additional gram-positive coverage. The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, dehydration, or autonomic instability. Steroids have been started for likely adrenal insufficiency, and IV fluids have been given as needed.

The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to infection or steroid-induced. The patient's renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 0.3-0.4. Oliguria was observed overnight, and IV fluids have been given as necessary. The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly low, suggesting a possible decreased volume status contributing to hypotension. 

The patient has chronic leg pain, which is unchanged, and is on chronic narcotics. There is no evidence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic ventilator/tracheostomy, severe COPD, prior left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He presents from a rehabilitation hospital after being found unresponsive. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has had low systolic blood pressure readings in the 70s at the rehabilitation hospital and upon arrival to the emergency department. This condition requires treatment and monitoring.
2. Possible Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture showed 3+ gram-negative rods, indicating a possible pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further culture data will be followed.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is being treated with IV hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to infection or steroid-induced. The CBC will continue to be trended.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are low, indicating possible acute renal failure. The creatinine will continue to be trended, and IV fluid boluses will be given as necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are slightly low but improving. This may be related to decreased volume status contributing to hypotension.
7. Right Leg Pain: The patient has chronic leg pain without evidence of edema or tenderness. He received oxycodone 5 mg with improvement, indicating ongoing pain management needs.
8. Recent Suicidal Ideation: The patient had a recent history of suicidal ideation during his last admission and was followed by psychiatry with 1:1 sitter. He denies current suicidal or homicidal ideation.
9. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient had elevated blood glucose levels during his last admission, which could be related to steroid use. Insulin therapy is ongoing, and consideration will be given to an insulin drip if hyperglycemia persists.
10. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation and is receiving lactulose, colace, and senna for management.
11. Seizure Disorder: The patient is on outpatient doses of levetiracetam and divalproex for seizure disorder, and consideration will be given to a neurology consult and EEG.
12. Schizophrenia: The patient is on outpatient risperidone for schizophrenia.
13. Feeding Tube: The patient is receiving tube feeds via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Monitoring for electrolyte imbalances and repletion as needed is important.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P Mr. [**Known lastname 3375**] is a 53 year old male with PMH of chronic vent/trach,
   severe COPD, prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, and recent
   admission for VAP who presents from rehab after being found
   unresponsive.
   # Hypotension: Systolic BP 70s at rehab and on arrival to ED.
   Continues to have SBP intermitently in the 90
   - Treat possible PNA with broad spectrum antibiotics as above.  Follow
   culture data.
   - Continue with IV hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency.
   - Continue to hold home diltiazem and lasix.
   - Continue to bolus IVF as needed.  Was net +1.5 L yesterday.
   # PICC line
 placement by IR likely Monday.
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infection versus steroid induced.
   - WBC this AM was 4.7. Continue to trend CBC
   - Continue with steroids
   - d/c femoral line when PICC placed.
   # Acute renal failure: b/l 0.2-0.3, 0.5 on presentation which may be
   acute renal failure for him.
   - AM creatinine of 0.4, continue to trend
   - Oliguric overnight, IVF bolus as necessary.
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-27.  Hct on admission was 32.3, again may
   point towards decreased volume status as etiology of hypotension.
   Currently 28.7.
   # Right leg pain: He had this pain for several years, it is unchanged
   and he is on chronic narcotics. On exam no evidence of edema or
   tenderness.  Complained of breakthrough pain through acetaminophen
   overnight and received oxycodone 5mg with improvement.
   - continue PRN pains meds, but hold for sedation
   # Recent history of suicidal ideation during last admission was
   followed by psychiatry and had 1:1 sitter.  Pt denies any suicidal or
   homocidal ideation currently.
   - Continue with home psychiatric medications.
   # Diabetes mellitus: Elevated BG last admission in setting of steroid
   use.
   - FS between 100-200.
   - Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   - Consider insulin drip if hyperglycemic.
   # Constipation:
   - Standing lactulose PRN, also receiving colase and senna.
   # Seizure disorder:
   - Continue outpatient dose of levetiracetam 250 mg PO BID, divalproex
   875 mg TID
   - consider neuro consult EEG
   # Schizophrenia:
   - Continue outpatient dose of risperidone
   # F/E/N: Tube feeds via PEG
   - Monitor lytes and replete PRN
   # PPx: proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis, SC
   heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   # Access: Right femoral line.  Plan to order PICC placement so that
   femoral line can be pulled.
   # Communication: Guardian [**Name (NI) 149**] [**Name (NI) 3322**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3316**], fax
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3377**].
   # Code: Full.  He has a guardian.  [**Name (NI) 53**] has mentioned to team
   members that he does not with to return to rehab hospital.  Will
   discuss with guardian and patient today further regarding code status
   and potential options including do not rehospitalize.
   # Dispo: Rehab hospital when PICC placed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic ventilator/tracheostomy, severe COPD, prior left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He presents from a rehabilitation hospital after being found unresponsive. 

The patient has a low blood pressure (hypotension) that responded to a normal saline IV bolus. He refused a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. 

His vital signs show a low-grade fever, tachycardia, and normal oxygen saturation. His blood work indicates leukocytosis, anemia, and acute renal failure. He also has elevated blood glucose levels, which may be due to steroid use.

The patient's medical history includes chronic pain in the right leg, recent suicidal ideation, diabetes mellitus, constipation, seizure disorder, schizophrenia, and feeding difficulties. 

The plan includes continuing treatment for possible pneumonia, holding home medications, providing IV fluids as needed, monitoring for acute renal failure, managing diabetes, and addressing other comorbidities.

Potential Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage. It needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support if necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P Mr. [**Known lastname 3375**] is a 53 year old male with PMH of chronic vent/trach,
   severe COPD, prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, and recent
   admission for VAP who presents from rehab after being found
   unresponsive.
   # Hypotension: Systolic BP 70s at rehab and on arrival to ED.
   Continues to have SBP intermitently in the 80
   - Continue to treat possible PNA with broad spectrum antibiotics
   (cefipime and bactrim).  Follow culture data.
   - Continue with IV hydrocortisone 50mg IV q8h for two more days before
   tapering to po steroids for likely adrenal insufficiency.
   - Continue to hold home diltiazem and lasix.
   - Continue to bolus IVF as needed.
   # PICC line
 Pt is currently refusing IR PICC placement.  Consider
   discharge to rehab without PICC line and omitting final dose of
   antibiotics (last day [**2141-7-12**]).
   # PEG obstruction: attempt pancreatic enzymes, changed Keppra
   administration to IV
   # Leukocytosis: Likely due to infection versus steroid induced.
   - Continue to trend CBC
   - Continue with steroids
   - d/c femoral line when PICC placed.
   # Acute renal failure: b/l 0.2-0.3, 0.5 on presentation which may be
   acute renal failure for him.
   - AM creatinine of 0.4, continue to trend
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-27.  Hct on admission was 32.3, again may
   point towards decreased volume status as etiology of hypotension.
   Currently 28.7.
   # Right leg pain: He had this pain for several years, it is unchanged
   and he is on chronic narcotics. On exam no evidence of edema or
   tenderness.  Complained of breakthrough pain through acetaminophen
   overnight and received oxycodone 5mg with improvement.
   - continue PRN pains meds, but hold for sedation
   # Recent history of suicidal ideation during last admission was
   followed by psychiatry and had 1:1 sitter.
   - Continue with home psychiatric medications.
   # Diabetes mellitus: Elevated BG last admission in setting of steroid
   use.
   - FS between 100-200.
   - Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   - Consider insulin drip if hyperglycemic.
   # Constipation:
   - Standing lactulose PRN, also receiving colase and senna.
   # Seizure disorder:
   - Continue outpatient dose of levetiracetam 250 mg PO BID, divalproex
   875 mg TID
   - consider neuro consult EEG
   # Schizophrenia:
   - Continue outpatient dose of risperidone
   # F/E/N: Tube feeds via PEG
   - Monitor lytes and replete PRN
   # PPx: proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis, SC
   heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   # Access: Right femoral line.  Will d/c when PICC line is placed.
   # Communication: Guardian [**Name (NI) 149**] [**Name (NI) 3322**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3316**], fax

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic vent/trach, severe COPD, prior left cerebral vascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient was found unresponsive and presented with hypotension. He is currently in the ICU and has been refusing PICC line placement, am labs, and PEG tube administration. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder, constipation, and right leg pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient continues to have intermittent systolic blood pressure in the 80s, indicating persistent hypotension. This may be due to possible pneumonia, adrenal insufficiency, or other underlying causes.

2. Possible Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected PNA. It is important to follow culture data and monitor for any signs of improvement or deterioration.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is receiving IV hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency. It is crucial to continue with the prescribed steroid regimen and tapering schedule.

4. PICC Line Refusal: The patient is refusing PICC line placement. This may lead to difficulties in administering medications and fluids if the femoral line is not sufficient.

5. PEG Obstruction: The patient's PEG tube"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension. The patient has a history of COPD, tracheotomy, schizophrenia, and other comorbidities. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST mode, with a set respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 mL. His blood pressure is stable, with a current reading of 127/70 mmHg. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.2 degrees Celsius, while his heart rate is within normal range at 86 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 97%. The patient has received antibiotics and is nearly completing the course. The plan includes switching to pressure support ventilation (PSV), restarting diuretics, and removing the femoral line. The patient's current medications include regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, UF heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and a proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P Mr. [**Known lastname 3375**] is a 53 year old male with PMH of chronic vent/trach,
   severe COPD, prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, and recent
   admission for VAP who presents from rehab after being found
   unresponsive.
   # Hypotension: Systolic BP 70s at rehab and on arrival to ED.
   Continues to have SBP intermitently in the 80
   - Continue to treat possible PNA with broad spectrum antibiotics
   (cefipime and bactrim).  Follow culture data.
   - Change IV hydrocortisone 50mg IV q8h to hydrocortisone 20mg po qam
   and 5mg po qpm for likely adrenal insufficiency.
   - Continue to bolus IVF as needed.
   #ventilator dependence:  currently on volume control.  Discuss with
   respiratory therapy a trial of pressure support ventilation.
   # PICC line
 Pt is currently refusing IR PICC placement.  Plan to
   discharge without line placement.  Pt has only one day remaining of IV
   antibiotic treatment (last day cefepime [**2141-7-12**]).  Will d/c femoral line
   at time of discharge.
   #PEG obstruction: attempt pancreatic enzymes to dissolve obstruction.
   If conservative measures do not resolve obstruction consult IR.  Once
   obstruction is cleared return Keppra to po administration.
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 25-27. Last Hct 28.7.
   # Right leg pain: He had this pain for several years, it is unchanged
   and he is on chronic narcotics. On exam no evidence of edema or
   tenderness.  Complained of breakthrough pain through acetaminophen
   overnight and received oxycodone 5mg with improvement.
   - continue PRN pains meds, but hold for sedation
   # Recent history of suicidal ideation during last admission was
   followed by psychiatry and had 1:1 sitter.
   - Continue with home psychiatric medications.
   # Diabetes mellitus: Elevated BG last admission in setting of steroid
   use.
   - FS between 100-200.
   - Continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   - Consider insulin drip if hyperglycemic.
   # Constipation:
   - Standing lactulose PRN, also receiving colase and senna.
   # Seizure disorder:
   - Continue outpatient dose of levetiracetam 250 mg PO BID, divalproex
   875 mg TID
   # Schizophrenia:
   - Continue outpatient dose of risperidone
   # F/E/N: Tube feeds via PEG
   - Monitor lytes and replete PRN
   # PPx: proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis, SC
   heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   # Access: Right femoral line.  Will d/c at time of discharge to rehab
   # Communication: Guardian [**Name (NI) 149**] [**Name (NI) 3322**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3316**], fax
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3377**].
   # Code: Full.  He has a guardian.  [**Name (NI) 53**] has mentioned to team
   members that he does not with to return to rehab hospital.  Will
   discuss with guardian and patient today further regarding code status
   and potential options including do not rehospitalize.
   # Dispo: Rehab hospital tomorrow.  Consult case manager to discuss
   options for rehab facilities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic ventilator/tracheostomy, severe COPD, prior left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with residual right-sided weakness, and recent admission for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He presents from rehab after being found unresponsive. The patient has several medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder, schizophrenia, anemia, right leg pain, and constipation. He is currently on various medications and treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia, hydrocortisone for likely adrenal insufficiency, and IV fluids as needed due to hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to have intermittent low systolic blood pressure in the 80s, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
2. Ventilator dependence: The patient is currently on volume control ventilation and is dependent on the ventilator for breathing. There is a plan to discuss with respiratory therapy a trial of pressure support ventilation. If not managed appropriately, ventilator dependence can lead to respiratory complications and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
3. PICC line refusal: The patient is refusing IR PICC (peripheral inserted central catheter) placement, which is necessary for central venous access. This may result in difficulties with administering medications, fluids, and nutritional support.
4. PEG tube obstruction: The patient's PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube is obstructed. If conservative measures to clear the obstruction fail, it may lead to feeding intolerance, malnutrition, and dehydration.
5. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) level is within the normal range (25-27%), but his last Hct level is 28.7%. Monitoring and management of anemia is important to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Right leg pain: The patient has a history of chronic right leg pain, which is unrelated to the current hospitalization. Proper pain management is essential to ensure patient comfort and quality of life.
7. Recent history of suicidal ideation: The patient had a recent history of suicidal thoughts during his last admission, and he received psychiatric intervention. Continued monitoring and support for mental health are crucial.
8. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, likely due to steroid use. Tight glycemic control is necessary to prevent hyperglycemia and its associated complications.

In summary, the patient's medical conditions and treatments present several potential complications that need to be closely monitored and managed. These include hypotension, ventilator dependence, PICC line refusal, PEG tube obstruction, anemia, right leg pain, suicidal ideation, and diabetes mellitus."
