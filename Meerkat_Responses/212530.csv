","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of MDS, prostate cancer, and recently diagnosed AML. He was admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML but has had a hospital course complicated by low counts, repeated incidents of tachypnea and fever, and an incidentally found perforated appendix on CT.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.4, with a maximum temperature of 38.6째C (101.4째F) and a current temperature of 38.6째C (101.4째F). His heart rate is 98 bpm, blood pressure is 126/67 mmHg, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's recent labs indicate low white blood cell count (0.2 K/uL), low hemoglobin level (10.2 g/dL), elevated creatinine level (170 mg/dL), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (959 IU/L). The platelet count is also low at 20 K/uL. Other lab values show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 108/143) and alkaline phosphatase level (122 U/L), as well as decreased lymphocyte count (56.0%).

   # Tachypnea: Patient had recurrent tachypnic and febrile spells on the
   floor with persistently negative cultures.  He had another of these
   last evening and currently O2 requirement stable but slurred speech and
   slight more distressed respirations are concerning for decompensation.
   BNP was elevated and CXR consistent with increased fluid overload
   (cephalization and increased markings) and increased infiltrates at
   bases.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo male with h/o leukemia now admitted to ICU with fever/sepsis with
   concerning picture of persistent fever and tachycardia and to date all
   cultures remain negative to date.  Of concern is patient with
   intra-abdominal source with appendix rupture and phlegmon persisting.
   Of concern is the evidence of persistent systemic insult with SIRS
   related to intra-abdominal insult.  This has been a course of
   persistent issue and worsening is suggested but patient has now
   transfer to ICU in the setting of tachypnea and with CXR changes it
   does suggest persistent insult.  What may well be at play is patient
   with start of return of WBC

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of leukemia, currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been experiencing recurrent tachypnea and fever. All cultures remain negative to date. The patient has an intra-abdominal source, specifically an appendix rupture and phlegmon persisting. There is evidence of persistent systemic insult with SIRS related to the intra-abdominal insult. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient has significant pulmonary edema, which may be non-hydrostatic in the setting of SIRS. There has been a moderate response to Lasix intermittently, but the patient may require intermittent use of NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) to allow complete support. If the patient progresses to acute respiratory failure and shows signs of [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/Non-hydrostatic edema, intubation may be necessary.
2. Sepsis-source primarily is APPENDICITIS S/P rupture and with phlegmon organization: The patient needs to continue receiving antibiotics, including vanco/Voriconazole/Meroenem/Acyclovir, and will need to consider repeat imaging if worsening.
3. Leukemia, acute (ALL, AML, cancer, malignant neoplasm): The patient requires transfusion per hematology recommendations and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), prostate cancer, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He was admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML and is currently on day 23 of the 7+3 chemotherapy regimen. The patient has been experiencing recurrent tachypnea and febrile spells. He has a known perforated appendix and phlegmon. His vital signs show a temperature of 103.6째F, blood pressure ranging from 114/58 to 184/91 mmHg, heart rate between 82-124 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's recurrent tachypnea and febrile spells indicate possible respiratory distress. This could be due to the underlying AML, pneumonia, or other respiratory infections. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is essential.

2. Fevers: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers. This suggests an ongoing infection, which needs further investigation through culture data and consultation with the Infectious Disease team.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although not diagnosed as ARDS, the patient's respiratory distress and potential lung involvement due to AML or infection may lead to the development of ARDS. Monitoring pulmonary function and oxygenation"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+23 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells.
   # Tachypnea: Patient had recurrent tachypnic and febrile spells on the
   floor with persistently negative cultures.  He had another of these
   last evening and currently O2 requirement stable but slurred speech and
   slight more distressed respirations are concerning for decompensation.
   BNP was elevated and CXR consistent with increased fluid overload
   (cephalization and increased markings) and increased infiltrates at
   bases.
   - Will aim for goal of another 1 L of diuresis today (give 20 mg
   furosemide IV this AM and repeat if necessary for goals)
   - Cont broad abx regimen  vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole,
   acyclovir, and voriconazole and f/u ID reccs
   - f/u culture data and CIS
   - Supplemental O2 as needed
   # Fevers: Culture negative to date.  On broad spectrum abx as noted
   above.
   - f/u cultures
   -F/U RUQ ultrasound
   # AML: Day 23 7+3 and ANC of 320 today (up from 0 yesterday).  Still
   neutropenic
   - Cont monitor and check daily CBC
s and ANC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   -neutropenic precautions
   .
   #Phlegmon/Perforated appendix: Patient remains pain free and tolerating
   clears.  Abdominal exam still somewhat distended.
   -Surgery following, will f/u their recommendations; currently very
   reluctant to operate given overall stability and neutropenia
   -Continue broad spectrum antibiotics

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including MDS, prostate cancer, and recently diagnosed AML.
- The patient was admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML and is now day 23 of treatment.
- He presented with respiratory distress and tachypnea, which have persisted despite negative cultures.
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and supplemental oxygen as needed.
- His blood counts show an ANC of 320, indicating neutropenia.
- There is concern for fluid overload, as evidenced by an elevated BNP and increased markings on a chest X-ray.
- The patient's abdominal exam is still somewhat distended, and there is ongoing discussion regarding surgery for a phlegmon/perforated appendix.
- The patient's code status is full code, confirmed with the patient and family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent tachypnea and respiratory distress raise concerns about respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation are necessary.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms, along with the chest X-ray findings of increased fluid overload, suggest the possibility of ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation parameters and appropriate ventilatory support may be required.
3. Infection: The patient's febrile spells and negative cultures indicate a potential ongoing infection. Continued administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is warranted, and culture data should"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+23 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
   # Respiratory Distress:  Patient had recurrent tachypneic and febrile
   spells on the floor with persistently negative cultures prior to
   transfer to floor.   Yesterday he became increasingly hypoxemic and
   confused despite increased O2 and required intubation.  The cause of
   his hypoxia is still  unclear and CT chest was fairly unremarkable for
   significant pathology.  Patient continues to be on broad spectrum
   antibiotics started while he had neutropenic fever.  Major concern is
   for pneumonia vs. immune reconstitution syndrome.
   -Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics:  vancomycin, levofloxacin,
   metronidazole, acyclovir, and voriconazole
   -Continue to monitor clinically, respiratory status stable on vent
   -Attempt to keep fluid balance equal over course of day (unable to
   diurese secondary to hypotension).
   -Methylprednisolone 80 mg IV BID per Heme reccs
   # Fevers: Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] cultures have all remained negative
   but patient has known infection in abdomen and has improving immune
   system.
   - f/u culture data and CIS
   - broad spectrum abx per above
   -F/U surgery  and ID reccs regarding possibility of surgery
   -F/U final read RUQ ultrasound
   # AML: Day 24 7+3 and ANC of 660 today (up from 320 yesterday).  No
   longer neutropenic.
   - Cont monitor and check daily CBC
s and ANC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   -neutropenic precautions
   -Continue filgrastim until ANC greater than 1000 given expected drop
   with discontinuation
   .
   #Phlegmon/Perforated appendix: Patient doesn
t appear acutely tender
   but does feel [**Hospital1 2435**] on right side of abdomen.  Will await final read
   of CT and talk to surgery.
   -F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 213**] reccs
   -Continue broad spectrum antibiotics

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including MDS, prostate cancer, and recently diagnosed AML. He was admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML and is now on day 23 of the 7+3 regimen. He has a history of perforated appendix and phlegmon. The patient presented to the ICU with recurrent tachypneic and febrile spells, hypoxemia, and confusion, requiring intubation. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory distress, fevers, AML, and a phlegmon/perforated appendix. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics since he had a neutropenic fever. The major concern is pneumonia versus immune reconstitution syndrome. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are: 
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and febrile spells may indicate pneumonia, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to AML treatment.
2. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS): Given the patient's improving immune system, there is a possibility of IRIS, which can cause similar symptoms as pneumonia.
3. Abdominal infection: The patient has a known infection in the abdomen due to the perforated appendix and phlegmon. This could potentially lead to further complications if not properly managed.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and confusion could be signs of AR"

   73 yo male with h/op AML now admitted to ICU with fever/hypotensin and
   sepsis with concern for possible intra-abdominal source of persistent
   insult perhaps more obviously mainfest in the setting of return of WBC
   function.  His respiratory failure does appear to be secondary to
   sepsis with likely early [**Doctor Last Name 11**] in place, however, non-specific
   pneumonitis has been suggested as well.  Will continue with support for
   combined system failure that continued ABX and monitoring may lead to
   continued improvement.

   Continue with support with pressors
   Check CvO2, CVP and work to wean pressors as possible.
   Check for autoPEEP but unlikely at this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, hypotension, and sepsis. The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to sepsis, with possible early ARDS and non-specific pneumonitis. The patient has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and appendicitis. The patient's leukocyte count is low, and there are signs of organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, acyclovir, Flagyl, and levofloxacin. Pressors are being used to maintain blood pressure, and the patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not managed appropriately.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to the ongoing infection and inflammation in the lungs.
3. Leukemia: The patient has a history of AML, which increases the risk of infection and can affect the immune system's ability to fight off infections.
4. Appendicitis: The patient has appendicitis, which could be a source of infection and sepsis.
5. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has signs of organ dysfunction, including low urine output and altered mental status, which can further complicate the management of his condition"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+23 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
   # Acute Respiratory Distress:  Patient had recurrent tachypneic and
   febrile spells on the floor with persistently negative cultures prior
   to transfer to floor.   Yesterday he became increasingly hypoxemic and
   confused despite increased O2 and required intubation.  The cause of
   his hypoxia is still  unclear and CT chest was fairly unremarkable for
   significant pathology.  Patient continues to be on broad spectrum
   antibiotics started while he had neutropenic fever.  Major concern is
   for pneumonia vs. immune reconstitution syndrome.   No longer
   neutropenic by [**2134-12-29**].
   -Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics:  vancomycin, levofloxacin,
   metronidazole, acyclovir, and voriconazole; will consider psudeomonas
   coverage if patient spikes or clinically worsens
   -Continue to monitor clinically, respiratory status stable on vent
   -Attempt to keep fluid balance equal over course of day (unable to
   diurese secondary to hypotension).
   -Methylprednisolone 80 mg IV BID x 2 doses per Heme reccs
   -will attempt to gradually weane off ventilator
   # Sepsis: Etiology of infection unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] cultures have all
   remained negative, with the exception of a BCx on [**2134-12-26**] from the line
   growing GPC in pairs/clusters.  Unclear whether this represents
   contaminant or true infection.  Patient also has known infection in
   abdomen which appears improved on abdominal CT on [**12-27**].  She is also no
   longer neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   - f/u culture data and CIS
   - surveillance cultures
   - broad spectrum abx per above
   -F/U surgery  and ID reccs regarding possibility of surgery
   -F/U final read RUQ ultrasound
   # AML: Day 24 7+3 and ANC of 660 today (up from 320 yesterday).  No
   longer neutropenic.
   - Cont monitor and check daily CBC
s and ANC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   - neutropenic precautions
   - will likely d/c filgrastim because ANC greater than 1000
   #Phlegmon/Perforated appendix: Patient doesn
t appear acutely tender
   but does feel [**Hospital1 2435**] on right side of abdomen.  Abd CT read as stable
   to improved phlegmon.  Surgery does not want to operate now.   [**Month (only) 51**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrome) and prostate cancer, who has recently been diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia). He is currently in the ICU for induction therapy of AML and has been experiencing tachypnea (rapid breathing) and febrile spells. The patient also has a known perforated appendix and phlegmon (inflammation of the soft tissue). 

The patient's recent events include being weaned off norepinephrine and maintaining mean arterial pressures above 60. He has been tested for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and received recommendations for methylprednisolone from the hematology/oncology team. A CT scan showed a stable phlegmon and relatively benign lung fields. The decision was made not to proceed with an appendectomy at this time.

Allergies:
The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracyclines, and Atrovent (Ipratropium Bromide), which caused hives.

Medications:
The patient has been given various medications, including meropenem, vancomycin, levofloxacin, voriconazole, metronidazole, and acyclovir. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Infusions:
The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 3 mg"

   73 yo male with AML s/p BMT now with sepsis and respiratory failure.
   Concern has been raised for possible intra-abdominal source as
   contributing but have CT scan without signficiant change and actually
   capacity to wean pressors to off through to this morning.  WBC has
   increased to 5.0.
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)-
   -Will discuss possible D/C of GCSF
   -Continue steroids
 APPENDICITIS
CT stable and patient clinically improved
   -flagyl/Levoflox/Acyclovir/Vanco
   -Continue to monitor exam
   -Will continue daily evaluations with surgery
   Sepsis
He does have fever elevation and positive blood culture noted on
   lab data returning
is preliminary culture results, however, is of
   concern
is a slow return of positive culture which is provocative.
   Will continue with follow up cultures but has shown clinical
   improvement in the setting of treatment and positive cultures which are
   concerning for contaminant.
   -Continue with vanco/Levoflox/Flagyl
   -Follow up culture results
   -Will discuss with ID role of line change vs. continued follow up of
   cultures and clinical exam
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-Good oxygenation and
   ventilation on current settings.  The significant concern is to allow
   ventilatory support to continue while weaning sedation and control of
   sepsis
   -Decrease RR to 16
   -Decrease FIO2 to 0.4
   -Will decrease sedation and move to PSV when spontaneous RR does
   improve.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post bone marrow transplant (BMT) now presenting with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is critical, and several potential medical complications can arise.

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to the AML and BMT, he is at an increased risk of infections and subsequent sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is also suffering from acute respiratory failure. This condition can be caused by various factors, including pneumonia, acute lung injury, or exacerbation of underlying chronic respiratory conditions. The patient's respiratory function needs close monitoring, and appropriate ventilatory support should be continued.

3. Intra-abdominal Source of Infection: There is concern about a possible intra-abdominal source contributing to the patient's sepsis. However, a CT scan has shown no significant changes, indicating that the source may not be present or may have been effectively managed.

4. Line-Associated Infections: Given the patient's multiple lines and central venous catheters, there is a risk of line-associated infections. The blood culture results should be closely monitored for any signs of infection related to these lines.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), prostate cancer, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He was admitted for induction therapy of newly diagnosed AML and is now on day 24 of treatment. The patient has been experiencing tachypnea and febrile spells, and he also has a known perforated appendix and phlegmon. He was transferred to the ICU for continued respiratory distress and febrile spells, despite negative cultures. The cause of his hypoxia remains unclear, and he required intubation. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which were started due to neutropenic fever. The major concern is pneumonia versus immune reconstitution syndrome. The patient is no longer neutropenic as of 12/29/2134.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient's recurrent tachypneic and febrile spells, along with persistently negative cultures, indicate a possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This condition can lead to hypoxemia and respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis: The patient has an unclear etiology of infection, and sepsis cannot be ruled out. Given his immunocompromised state due to AML treatment, he is at high risk for bacterial infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with MDS, prostate cancer, and recently diagnosed AML. He was admitted for induction therapy of AML and is now on day 23 of treatment. The patient has a history of perforated appendix and phlegmon. He presented with recurrent tachypnea and febrile spells, leading to intubation due to hypoxemia and confusion. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and the patient is being monitored closely for pneumonia or immune reconstitution syndrome. The patient is no longer neutropenic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient's hypoxemia and confusion may indicate a respiratory infection or immune reconstitution syndrome. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and ongoing administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended.
2. Sepsis: The etiology of infection is unclear, but the patient has known infections in the abdomen. The patient's response to broad-spectrum antibiotics should be closely monitored, and further culture data and consultation with surgery and infectious disease specialists are necessary.
3. AML: The patient is currently undergoing induction therapy for AML. Regular monitoring of CBC and ANC is essential to assess the effectiveness of treatment and the risk of neutropenia. Transfusion may be required to maintain an adequate hematocrit and platelet count.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+23 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
   # Acute Respiratory Distress:  Patient had recurrent tachypneic and
   febrile spells on the floor with persistently negative cultures prior
   to transfer to floor.   Yesterday he became increasingly hypoxemic and
   confused despite increased O2 and required intubation.  The cause of
   his hypoxia is still  unclear and CT chest was fairly unremarkable for
   significant pathology.  Patient continues to be on broad spectrum
   antibiotics started while he had neutropenic fever.  Major concern is
   for pneumonia vs. immune reconstitution syndrome.   No longer
   neutropenic by [**2134-12-29**].
   -Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics:  vancomycin, levofloxacin,
   metronidazole, acyclovir, and voriconazole; will consider psudeomonas
   coverage if patient spikes or clinically worsens
   -Continue to monitor clinically, respiratory status stable on vent
   -Attempt to keep fluid balance equal over course of day (unable to
   diurese secondary to hypotension).
   -Methylprednisolone 80 mg IV BID x 2 doses per Heme reccs
   -will attempt to gradually weane off ventilator
   # Sepsis: Etiology of infection unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] cultures have all
   remained negative, with the exception of a BCx on [**2134-12-26**] from the line
   growing GPC in pairs/clusters.  Unclear whether this represents
   contaminant or true infection.  Patient also has known infection in
   abdomen which appears improved on abdominal CT on [**12-27**].  She is also no
   longer neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   - f/u culture data and CIS
   - surveillance cultures
   - broad spectrum abx per above
   -F/U surgery  and ID reccs regarding possibility of surgery
   -F/U final read RUQ ultrasound
   # AML: Day 24 7+3 and ANC of 660 today (up from 320 yesterday).  No
   longer neutropenic.
   - Cont monitor and check daily CBC
s and ANC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   - neutropenic precautions
   - will likely d/c filgrastim because ANC greater than 1000
   #Phlegmon/Perforated appendix: Patient doesn
t appear acutely tender
   but does feel [**Hospital1 2435**] on right side of abdomen.  Abd CT read as stable
   to improved phlegmon.  Surgery does not want to operate now.   [**Month (only) 51**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), prostate cancer, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He was admitted for induction chemotherapy of newly diagnosed AML on day 23 and transferred to the ICU due to continued tachypnea and febrile spells. The patient also has a known perforated appendix and phlegmon.

24-hour events:
- The patient was successfully extubated in the morning, but an arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pure metabolic alkalosis.
- A speech and swallow evaluation was ordered, and the patient coughed when given fluids to drink by the nurse.
- The patient received 1 liter of D5W to correct high sodium levels in the afternoon.
- The patient's sodium level was corrected, and potassium repletion was ordered.
- The patient continues to have altered mental status with diffuse weakness in the evening. A head CT, urinalysis (U/A), and ABG were ordered.
- The patient was reintubated in the morning for hypercapnic respiratory distress.

Medical allergies include penicillins, tetracyclines, and Atrovent (ipratropium bromide). The last dose of antibiotics given was meropenem on 12/27 at 02:00 PM.

Infusions:
- Fentanyl: 25 mcg/hour

   -Will discuss antibiotic choices with BMT attending
 APPENDICITIS/SEPSIS-
   -Good clinical improvement
   -Will continue with medical management
   -Continue with -Vanco/Vori/Acyclovir/Levoflox/Flagyl
   -Fungal evaluations negative to date
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   -Minimal Sedation
   -Moderate secretions continuing and will move to negative fluid balance
   as possible
   -He has, otherwise favorable predictors for successful extubation
   -Will look for decreased secretion volume prior to extubation
   -Diuresis to be attempted today if respiratory status worsening
   -SBT 5/0 for 30 minutes to evaluate for possible compromise from return
   of pulmonary edema
   LFT Abnormalities-
   - Antibiotics as potential source
   -RUQ U/S unrevealing in past
   -Will trend further and look to D/C Voriconazole if reasonable

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory failure, leukemia (acute), and appendicitis/sepsis.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, as he is on mechanical ventilation with pressures well tolerated. There are plans to attempt extubation once secretion volume decreases and other favorable predictors for successful extubation are met.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. The ICU care includes prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and VAP.

Additionally, the patient has abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) which may be related to antibiotics or another underlying condition. Further evaluation and monitoring of liver function is planned.

Overall, the patient's critical illness requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications in order to improve his condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+24 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
    # Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to be well oxygenated
   and well ventilated on pressure support.  He has a cuff leak this AM.
   Therefore, we will proceed to extubate him this morning.
   -Extubate
   -Recheck ABG approximately one hour after extubation
   # Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive during his neutropenia and
   there was concern for sepsis/bacteremia thought blood cultures have
   remained negative with the exception of a BCx on [**2134-12-26**] from the line
   growing GPC in pairs/clusters.  Unclear whether this represents
   contaminant or true infection.  Patient also has known infection in
   abdomen which appears improved on abdominal CT on [**12-27**].  He is also no
   longer neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   - f/u culture data and CIS; had GPC in pairs and clusters on [**2133-12-25**]
   blood cx but no other blood cx
s positive
   - surveillance cultures
   - Levofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole for abdominal infection and ?
   pneumonia, we will continue these for 7 days pos resolution of
   neutropenia (through [**2135-1-5**])
   -F/U surgery  reccs
   # AML: Day 27 of 7+3 and ANC now in normal range.  No longer
   neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   - Continue to monitor and check daily CBC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   - no longer on filgrastim because ANC greater than 1000
    # Elevated LFTs:  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to drug toxicity (most likely)
   versus acalculous chlolecystitis versus infectious process.   Previous
   ultrasound without pericholeycystic fluid so low index of suspicion for
   choleycystitis.
    #Phlegmon/Perforated appendix: Patient doesn
t appear acutely tender
   but does feel [**Hospital1 2435**] on right side of abdomen.  Abd CT read as stable
   to improved phlegmon.  Surgery does not want to operate now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), prostate cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He was admitted for induction therapy of newly diagnosed AML. The patient is currently in the ICU due to ongoing respiratory distress, febrile spells, and a perforated appendix with phlegmon. His current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to be well oxygenated and well ventilated on pressure support. However, he has a cuff leak this morning, which indicates a potential laryngeal edema. Therefore, the plan is to proceed with extubation today. Post-extubation, an ABG will be rechecked approximately one hour later.

2. Hypotension: The patient was previously hypotensive during neutropenia, but now that he is no longer neutropenic, the hypotension is less concerning. Blood cultures have remained negative except for one positive blood culture from the central line, which might be a contaminant or a true infection. The patient also has an abdominal infection that appears improved on the abdominal CT scan. 

3. AML: The patient is on day 27 of 7+3 induction chemotherapy for AML, and his absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is now in the normal range. Daily CBC monitoring will continue, and transfusions will be given if necessary. Filgrast"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+24 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
   # Acute Respiratory Distress:  Patient had recurrent tachypneic and
   febrile spells on the floor with persistently negative cultures prior
   to transfer to floor.   Yesterday he became increasingly hypoxemic and
   confused despite increased O2 and required intubation.  The cause of
   his hypoxia is still  unclear and CT chest was fairly unremarkable for
   significant pathology.  Patient continues to be on broad spectrum
   antibiotics started while he had neutropenic fever.  Major concern is
   for pneumonia vs. immune reconstitution syndrome.   No longer
   neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   -Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics:  vancomycin, levofloxacin,
   metronidazole, acyclovir; consider d/c voriconazole because of elevated
   LFTs
   -Will consider psudeomonas coverage if patient spikes or clinically
   worsens
   -Tolerating pressure support; will attempt to weane off ventilator
   today
   -S/p methylprednisolone 80 mg IV BID x 2 doses per Heme reccs
   # Sepsis: Etiology of infection unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] cultures have all
   remained negative, with the exception of a BCx on [**2134-12-26**] from the line
   growing GPC in pairs/clusters.  Unclear whether this represents
   contaminant or true infection.  Patient also has known infection in

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), prostate cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
- He was admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML and developed acute respiratory distress requiring intubation.
- The cause of his hypoxia is unclear, and he has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to neutropenic fever.
- His condition has been stable, with no significant findings on CT chest.
- He has an elevated white blood cell count and is no longer neutropenic.
- His liver function tests are elevated, possibly due to drug toxicity or other causes.
- He has a known infection in the abdomen, which appears improved.
- His platelet count is low, and he has a central venous catheter.
- The patient is on nicotine patches and has a history of smoking.
- He has a diagnosis of prostate cancer and is not currently receiving active management.
- The patient's code status is full code.
- He has several medications and infusions, including midazolam, fentanyl, vancomycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole, acyclovir, and TPN with lipids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's acute respiratory distress and persistent hypoxemia despite increased oxygen may indicate pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+24 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
    # Acute Respiratory Distress:  Patient had recurrent tachypneic and
   febrile spells on the floor with persistently negative cultures prior
   to transfer to floor.   Yesterday he became increasingly hypoxemic and
   confused despite increased O2 and required intubation.  The cause of
   his hypoxia is still  unclear and CT chest was fairly unremarkable for
   significant pathology.  Patient continues to be on broad spectrum
   antibiotics started while he had neutropenic fever.  Major concern is
   for pneumonia vs. immune reconstitution syndrome.   No longer
   neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   -Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics:  vancomycin, levofloxacin,
   metronidazole, acyclovir; consider d/c voriconazole because of elevated
   LFTs
   -Will consider psudeomonas coverage if patient spikes or clinically
   worsens
   -Tolerating pressure support; will attempt to weane off ventilator
   today
   -S/p methylprednisolone 80 mg IV BID x 2 doses per Heme reccs
   # Sepsis: Etiology of infection unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] cultures have all
   remained negative, with the exception of a BCx on [**2134-12-26**] from the line
   growing GPC in pairs/clusters.  Unclear whether this represents
   contaminant or true infection.  Patient also has known infection in

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+24 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
    # Acute Respiratory Distress:  Patient had recurrent tachypneic and
   febrile spells on the floor with persistently negative cultures prior
   to transfer to floor.   Yesterday he became increasingly hypoxemic and
   confused despite increased O2 and required intubation.  The cause of
   his hypoxia is still  unclear and CT chest was fairly unremarkable for
   significant pathology.  Patient continues to be on broad spectrum
   antibiotics started while he had neutropenic fever.  Major concern is
   for pneumonia vs. immune reconstitution syndrome.   No longer
   neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   -Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics:  vancomycin, levofloxacin,
   metronidazole, acyclovir; consider d/c voriconazole because of elevated
   LFTs
   -Will consider psudeomonas coverage if patient spikes or clinically
   worsens
   -Tolerating pressure support; will attempt to weane off ventilator
   today
   -S/p methylprednisolone 80 mg IV BID x 2 doses per Heme reccs

   remained negative, with the exception of a BCx on [**2134-12-26**] from the line
   growing GPC in pairs/clusters.  Unclear whether this represents
   contaminant or true infection.  Patient also has known infection in
   abdomen which appears improved on abdominal CT on [**12-27**].  She is also no
   longer neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].

   - Cont monitor and check daily CBC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   - no longer on filgrastim because ANC greater than 1000
    # Elevated LFTs:  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to drug toxicity (most likely)
   versus acalculous chlolecystitis versus infectious process.  Will d/c
   vericonazole and continue to trend.
    #Phlegmon/Perforated appendix: Patient doesn
t appear acutely tender
   but does feel [**Hospital1 2435**] on right side of abdomen.  Abd CT read as stable
   to improved phlegmon.  Surgery does not want to operate now.   [**Month (only) 51**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), prostate cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He was admitted for induction of AML treatment and has been experiencing recurrent tachypnea and febrile spells. He was intubated due to hypoxemia and confusion. The cause of his hypoxia is still unclear, but he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a possible pneumonia or immune reconstitution syndrome. His neutropenia has resolved. Other issues include elevated liver function tests, a phlegmon, and a history of perforated appendix. The patient's current status is stable, and he is tolerating pressure support. The medical team is considering weaning him off the ventilator today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's hypoxemia and confusion could indicate respiratory distress, which may be caused by pneumonia or immune reconstitution syndrome. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's febrile spells and positive cultures suggest an infection, potentially leading to sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and response to antibiotics is essential.
3. Elevated liver function tests: The patient's elevated LFTs may be due to drug toxicity, acalculous cholecystitis, or an infectious process. Frequent monitoring of liver enzymes and clinical symptoms is needed"

   73 yo male with improved respiratory status and able to maintain
   ventilation and oxygenation on minimal ventilatory settings this
   morning.  The issue of upper airway obstruction with absence of cuff
   leak does seem to be substantially improved through to this morning.
   He has signficiant elevation in WBC count this morning but that is in
   the setting of steroid Rx and likely represents demargination.
   Fentanyl/Versed off, Lasix x1, Secreations decresed through to this

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE-
   -Possible PNA and may well be a component of non-cardiogenic edema
   leading to presistent respiratory failure
   -He has excellent tolerance of minimal ventilator settings
   -Cuff leak clearly heard
   -Secretions decreased in volume
   -Mental status excellent
   -Motor strength perserved

 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, and suspected pneumonia. The patient has shown improvement in respiratory status and is able to maintain ventilation and oxygenation on minimal ventilatory settings. The absence of cuff leak suggests upper airway obstruction, but this seems to have improved. The patient's white blood cell count has significantly increased, which could be due to steroid treatment and demargination.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be attributed to possible pneumonia and non-cardiogenic edema leading to persistent respiratory failure. The patient's tolerance of minimal ventilator settings, clear cuff leak, decreased secretions, excellent mental status, and preserved motor strength are positive signs.

2. Leukemia, Acute (ALL, AML, Cancer, Malignant Neoplasm): The patient's neutropenia has resolved, but further bone marrow biopsy will be needed to confirm the diagnosis. This indicates a possibility of underlying leukemia.

3. Appendicitis: Broad-spectrum antibiotics will continue for appendicitis. Daily exams will be conducted to monitor the condition.

4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): The patient's acute respiratory failure is not related to ARDS. This condition requires careful management.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+24 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
    # Respiratory Distress: The patient has been intermittently tachypneic
   since extubation but does not appear labored and denies pain.  Most
   likely a large part of his perceived difficulty is simply fatigue and
   weakness resulting from his long illness.
   -low index of suspicion for ABG if appears more distressed, tiring,  MS
   changes
   -supplementary O2 PRN
   -completing seven days of antibiotic therapy for pneumonia since end of
   neutropenia (through [**2135-1-5**])
   #Perforated appendix/Phlegmon: Patient has had diffuse symptoms but
   most seem centered around abdomen where there is known abscess.  We
   will rescan his abdomen today with a CT to look for interval change in
   his phlegmon.
   -CT abdomen
   -D/W surgery
   -Continue levofloxacin/metronidazole
   # Hypotension: The patient
s hypotension has resolved and despite
   appearing unwell he is not febrile at this time.
   -F/U culture data
   - antibiotics per above
   -F/U surgery  reccs
   # AML: Day 27 of 7+3 and ANC now in normal range.  No longer
   neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   - Continue to monitor and check daily CBC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   - no longer on filgrastim because ANC greater than 1000
    # Elevated LFTs:  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to drug toxicity versus acalculous
   chlolecystitis versus infectious process.   Previous ultrasound without
   pericholeycystic fluid so low index of suspicion for choleycystitis.
   Will reevaluate with CT abdomen today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), prostate cancer, and recently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He was admitted for induction therapy of newly diagnosed AML and transferred to the ICU due to persistent tachypnea and febrile spells.

The patient has been intermittently tachypneic since extubation but does not appear labored and denies pain. It is likely that his perceived difficulty is due to fatigue and weakness resulting from his long illness. The low index of suspicion for ABG if he appears more distressed, with MS changes. Supplementary O2 should be provided as needed.

The patient also has a known perforated appendix and phlegmon. A CT scan of the abdomen will be performed today to look for any interval changes in the phlegmon. The patient will continue on levofloxacin and metronidazole.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he is not febrile at this time. The cultures will be followed up, and he will continue on the current antibiotic regimen. Surgery recommendations will be followed up.

The patient is currently day 27 of 7+3 induction therapy for AML, and his absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is now in the normal range, indicating that he is no longer neutropenic. Daily CBC monitoring will be continued, and blood transfusions will be given"

   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+24 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
    # Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to be well oxygenated
   and well ventilated on pressure support.  He has a cuff leak this AM.
   Therefore, we will proceed to extubate him this morning.
   -Extubate
   -Recheck ABG approximately one hour after extubation
   # Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive during his neutropenia and
   there was concern for sepsis/bacteremia thought blood cultures have
   remained negative with the exception of a BCx on [**2134-12-26**] from the line
   growing GPC in pairs/clusters.  Unclear whether this represents
   contaminant or true infection.  Patient also has known infection in
   abdomen which appears improved on abdominal CT on [**12-27**].  He is also no
   longer neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   - f/u culture data and CIS; had GPC in pairs and clusters on [**2133-12-25**]
   blood cx but no other blood cx
s positive
   - surveillance cultures
   - Levofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole for abdominal infection and ?
   pneumonia, we will continue these for 7 days pos resolution of
   neutropenia (through [**2135-1-5**])
   -F/U surgery  reccs
   # AML: Day 27 of 7+3 and ANC now in normal range.  No longer
   neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   - Continue to monitor and check daily CBC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   - no longer on filgrastim because ANC greater than 1000
    # Elevated LFTs:  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to drug toxicity (most likely)
   versus acalculous chlolecystitis versus infectious process.   Previous
   ultrasound without pericholeycystic fluid so low index of suspicion for
   choleycystitis.
    #Phlegmon/Perforated appendix: Patient doesn
t appear acutely tender

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 73 yo male with MDS and prostate cancer along with
   recently diagnosed AML, admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML
   now D+24 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
    # Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to be well oxygenated
   and well ventilated on pressure support.  He has a cuff leak this AM.
   Therefore, we will proceed to extubate him this morning.
   -Extubate
   -Recheck ABG approximately one hour after extubation
   # Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive during his neutropenia and
   there was concern for sepsis/bacteremia thought blood cultures have
   remained negative with the exception of a BCx on [**2134-12-26**] from the line
   growing GPC in pairs/clusters.  Unclear whether this represents
   contaminant or true infection.  Patient also has known infection in
   abdomen which appears improved on abdominal CT on [**12-27**].  He is also no
   longer neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].

   -F/U surgery  reccs
   # AML: Day 27 of 7+3 and ANC now in normal range.  No longer
   neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   - Continue to monitor and check daily CBC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   - no longer on filgrastim because ANC greater than 1000

   versus acalculous chlolecystitis versus infectious process.   Previous
   ultrasound without pericholeycystic fluid so low index of suspicion for
   choleycystitis.
    #Phlegmon/Perforated appendix: Patient doesn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of recent induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and admission to the ICU with respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has shown stability in oxygenation and ventilation after being extubated but still has persistent leukocytosis and rising liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's course has been complicated by phlegmon and appendicitis with associated sepsis and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, which can be a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical intervention.

2. Sepsis: The patient has had episodes of fever and is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state from leukemia treatment. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and can be fatal if not treated promptly.

3. Leukemia Recurrence: While less likely, there is a possibility of leukemia recurrence, which can affect multiple organ systems and lead to complications.

4. Liver Dysfunction: The rising LFTs indicate liver dysfunction, which may be due to various factors such as infection, drug toxicity, or underlying liver disease. Monitoring liver function closely is important to detect any further deterioration.

5. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient has experienced nausea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential aspiration if not managed appropriately.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including MDS, prostate cancer, and recently diagnosed AML. He was admitted for induction of newly diagnosed AML and has been in the ICU for continued tachypnea and febrile spells.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intermittently tachypneic since extubation but does not appear labored. This could indicate an increased risk for respiratory failure if the tachypnea progresses or if there are any other underlying respiratory issues.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient may have aspirated during the placement of a nasogastric tube, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia. The patient is at risk for developing this complication due to his inability to protect his airway.

3. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile and has shown signs of infection. If the infection is not properly managed, it can progress to sepsis, a life-threatening condition.

4. Appendicitis Abscess: Although the CT scan showed an improved appearance of appendicitis without abscess, there is still a possibility of an undetected abscess or recurrence of the condition. This could lead to further complications such as a worsening infection or perforation.

   now D+24 after 7+3 and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for continued tachypnea
   and febrile spells also with known perforated appendix and phlegmon.
    # Respiratory Distress: The patient has been intermittently tachypneic
   since extubation but does not appear labored and denies pain.  Most
   likely a large part of his perceived difficulty is simply fatigue and
   weakness resulting from his long illness.
   -low index of suspicion for ABG if appears more distressed, tiring,  MS
   changes
   -supplementary O2 PRN
   -completing seven days of antibiotic therapy for pneumonia since end of
   neutropenia (through [**2135-1-5**])
   #Perforated appendix/Phlegmon: Patient has had diffuse symptoms but
   most seem centered around abdomen where there is known abscess.  We
   will rescan his abdomen today with a CT to look for interval change in
   his phlegmon.
   -CT abdomen
   -D/W surgery
   -Continue levofloxacin/metronidazole

s hypotension has resolved and despite
   appearing unwell he is not febrile at this time.
   -F/U culture data
   - antibiotics per above
   -F/U surgery  reccs
   # AML: Day 27 of 7+3 and ANC now in normal range.  No longer
   neutropenic as of [**2134-12-29**].
   - Continue to monitor and check daily CBC
   - Transfuse per onc team for Hct <25 and Plt <10
   - no longer on filgrastim because ANC greater than 1000
    # Elevated LFTs:  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to drug toxicity versus acalculous

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a prolonged course of sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is showing stability in their CT scan, with an improved and localized phlegmon. The patient's hemodynamics and respiratory status have also improved.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Although the patient's respiratory status has improved, there is still a risk for respiratory failure due to the previous condition.

2. Sepsis: The patient is still at risk for sepsis since he has been diagnosed with it. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment will be necessary.

3. Aspiration: Due to the inability to protect the airway, there is a risk for aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia or other respiratory infections.

4. Leukemia: Although not currently diagnosed, the presence of leukopenia (low white blood cell count) may indicate an underlying hematological condition such as leukemia.

5. Appendicitis: The patient's initial presentation may have been appendicitis, but it has improved on the CT scan. However, there is still a possibility of complications related to the appendicitis.

6. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible liver injury or inflammation. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

7. Nausea/vomiting: These symptoms can be associated with various conditions, including medications,"
