   Assessment and Plan
   64 y.o female with h.o multiple B-cell lymphomas, s/p SCT, who
   presented with SOB/fever, now persistently hypotensive.
   .
   # Shock: Etiologies still include sepsis, constrictive pericarditis,
   and adrenal insufficiency. Infectious source remains unclear, sinus
   appears less likely given ENT evaluation overnight. Remains afebrile
   (although per report 98-99F is high for the pt) Currently on
   vanco/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/Caspofungin for broad spectrum coverage. ID following
   closely.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 10-12
   - Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics, Vanco, [**Last Name (un) 614**], caspo per ID recs.
   - Follow-up blood, urine, sputum, viral cultures
   - RUQ to assess liver for potential infectious etiologies
   - repeat cx
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Will d/c steroids for now, and Cortstim in 24hrs if pt remains
   hemodynamically stable. Will add steroids back at lower dose
   - Will discuss with Cards today specifically if Constrictive
   Pericarditis is a cause for her hypotension.
   .
   #. SOB: On 2L overnight. Unclear etiology although could be secondary
   to CHF or unrecognized PNA
   -wean 02 as tol
   -low threshold to intubate if needed, as pt with cardiovas dx and given
   several liters IVF.
   -nebs
   -cough suppressants.
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic CHF: Patient s/p emergent CABG within 1 year.
   - Continue with hemodyamic goals as listed above.
   - Hold BB/lasix/aldactone as hypotensive.
   - Cards Recs today
   - Following Dig level

   # L arm Swelling. Unclear etiology
   - r/u UE DVT with non-invasive doppler
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Etiology unclear to [**Name (NI) 1**] team, likely secondary to
   patients MDS.
   -          Will discuss with Heme-Onc and gather more history

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of multiple B-cell lymphomas who has undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and fever, and is currently persistently hypotensive. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient's hypotension and low blood pressure indicate a possible shock state. The etiologies being considered are sepsis, constrictive pericarditis, and adrenal insufficiency. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as IV fluids, vasopressors (Levophed), and broad-spectrum antibiotics, are necessary to manage this condition.

2. Infection: Despite being afebrile currently, the patient's persistent fever and the ongoing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest an ongoing infectious process. Cultures and follow-up blood, urine, and sputum tests are recommended to identify the source of infection.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery within the past year, and there is concern for acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) as an etiology for her SOB. Hemodynamic goals need to be continued, and cardiac recommendations should be discussed today.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient's SOB may be secondary to CHF or unrecognized pneumonia. Weaning off oxygen as tolerated is"

   ucx, CMV, stool, sputum, lyme and brucella that have all been negative
   to date. Blood toxo IgM only +thought not to be source of true
   infection. Other possibilities include endocarditis, meningitis or
   intraabdominal/hepatic pathology given persistently elevated bili.
   Other etiologies of hypotension include PE-pt current sating well,
   tamponade, had neg ECHO this am. Other possibilities include adrenal
   insufficiency. Of note, pt was about to undergo [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim prior to ICU
   transfer.  Pt may be hypovolemic as well as she has been actively

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple B-cell lymphomas, who has undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and fever, and is now persistently hypotensive. The patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing infectious workup including blood cultures, urine cultures, and tests for CMV, stool, sputum, lyme, and brucella have all been negative to date. The presence of blood toxo IgM is positive, but it is not considered the source of true infection. 

Possible etiologies for the patient's hypotension include infection, endocarditis, meningitis, intra-abdominal or hepatic pathology, or adrenal insufficiency. The patient may also be hypovolemic due to active diuresis for congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The plan includes central venous line placement, IV fluids to target CVP of 10-12, Levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and urine output (UOP) above 30cc/hr, broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco, [Last Name (un) 614], caspo per ID recs.), follow-up blood, urine, sputum, viral cultures, repeat chest X-ray (cx), trend WBC count fever curve, and IV steroids to cover for possible adrenal insufficiency (AI).

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of multiple B-cell lymphomas, who has undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT).
- She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and fever, and has been persistently hypotensive.
- The potential causes for her hypotension include sepsis, constrictive pericarditis, and adrenal insufficiency.
- She is currently on vancomycin, caspofungin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 98-99F, blood pressure ranging from 86/51 to 149/71 mmHg, heart rate of 100 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels, as well as low platelet count.
- The patient's chest X-ray is pending, and she has undergone ultrasounds of her right upper quadrant (RUQ) and left upper extremity (LUE), which were unremarkable for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- She has a rash that is worsening and has received fluid boluses, which have improved her central venous pressure (CVP), mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2), and cardiac output.
- The patient's goal CVP is 10-12, and she requires norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and urine output above 30cc/hr.
- She has been on steroids, which have been stopped for now.
- The patient's cardiovascular status is concerning, with evidence of right heart depression on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE), increased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and a possible diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis.
- Her blood cultures, EBV viral load, CMV viral load, and other tests are pending.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to her myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
- She has swelling in her left arm, which is under investigation for possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and lines are being managed in the ICU.
- She is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.
- The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, constrictive pericarditis, adrenal insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thrombocytopenia, and further deterioration of her cardiovascular status."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of multiple B-cell lymphomas, who has undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). She presented with shortness of breath and fever, and is now persistently hypotensive. The potential causes of hypotension include sepsis, constrictive pericarditis, and adrenal insufficiency. Infectious sources are still unclear, and the patient remains on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Fluid overload has been addressed with Lasix, and Levophed is being used to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 and urine output (UOP) greater than 30cc/hr. Blood cultures, repeat chest X-ray, and RUQ ultrasound have been ordered.

SOB:
The patient's shortness of breath is likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) or an unrecognized pulmonary infection. Intubation may be necessary if needed. Diuretics and nebulizers will be used for treatment.

Acute on Chronic CHF:
The patient had emergent CABG within the past year. Hemodynamic goals will be continued, including diuretic therapy. The possibility of a Swan-Ganz catheter placement for pressures is being considered.

L Arm Swelling:
The cause of the left arm swelling is unclear, but an ultrasound has ruled out deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Thrombocytopenia:
The patient's low platelet count is likely due to her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of multiple B-cell lymphomas, who has undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). She presented with shortness of breath and fever, but is now hypotensive. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and caspofungin) due to sepsis, and her viral culture came back negative. Her random cortisol level was normal before starting steroids. The patient's current issues include hypotension, which could be caused by constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, sepsis, or peripheral vasodilation. She remains afebrile but has occasional fevers reported. Her dry weight goal is -500, and she is being closely monitored by the ID team.

The patient also has symptoms of SOB, acute on chronic CHF (post-emergent CABG within 1 year), and L arm swelling. The arm swelling has improved and an ultrasound ruled out deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to her myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and will require platelet transfusion if her platelet count falls below 10K.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion, organ dysfunction, and potential shock.
2. Infection: Despite being treated with broad-spectrum"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented with an unknown chief complaint. They have a history of allergies to penicillins, Reglan (Metoclopramide Hcl), iodine, Compazine (Injection) (Prochlorperazine Edisylate), hayfever (Nasal) (Homeopathic Drugs), Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Magnesium Sulfate, Dalmane (Oral) (Flurazepam Hcl), Acyclovir Analogues, Caspofungin, and Meropenem. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including Furosemide (Lasix) and other ICU medications. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 93/53 mmHg to 118/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's weight is currently 51 kg. The central venous pressure is 12 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an input of 1,319 mL and output of 2,075 mL over the past 24 hours. 

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.32. The physical examination findings are incomplete due to the patient not being assessed in several areas. The laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 3.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, sodium level of 146 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.8 mg/dL, chloride level of 102 mEq/L, magnesium level of 26.2%, bicarbonate level of 3.6 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen level of 27 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 122 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab results include elevated PT/PTT/INR levels, elevated CK/MB levels, elevated LDH levels, normal calcium and phosphate levels, and abnormal liver function test results.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing hypotension. The low blood pressure readings indicate potential hypotension, which may be related to the patient's overall condition or a specific medical complication. The patient's elevated troponin-T levels suggest possible cardiac involvement, such as myocardial injury or heart failure. The incomplete physical examination findings and abnormal laboratory results further indicate the presence of other potential medical complications, but a more detailed assessment would be necessary to determine their nature."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of multiple B-cell lymphomas, who has undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). She presented with shortness of breath and fever but is now persistently hypotensive. The possible causes of shock include sepsis, constrictive pericarditis, and adrenal insufficiency. The infectious source remains unclear, and the patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals as per ID recommendations.

The patient's vitals show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/53 mmHg to 118/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 51 kg, CVP is 12 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an output of 1,319 mL total in, 960 mL PO, 359 mL IVF, and 2,075 mL total out with a negative balance of -756 mL.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be alert and oriented, with pale conjunctiva, tachycardia, clear lung sounds, soft abdomen with no tenderness or distension, and bilateral edema at the ankles. The lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels, while showing normal glucose levels.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with a complicated medical history, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU for shock and altered mental status/encephalopathy. The patient's condition has improved, with improvement in hemodynamic status and mental status. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Shock: The patient initially presented with shock and required vasopressors for hemodynamic support. Although she has been weaned off vasopressors, close monitoring of her blood pressure and cardiac function is essential to prevent recurrent shock.

2. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics and antifungals, suggesting a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained, and it is important to identify the causative organism and continue appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

3. Congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%. In the ICU, her pulmonary edema has been managed with diuretics. It is crucial to optimize preload and maintain adequate cardiac output while monitoring for signs of fluid overload or worsening heart failure.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, increasing the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet levels and appropriate management, such as platelet transfusion or other interventions, should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   64-year-old woman with complicated oncologic history (hodgkins lymphoma
   s/p xrt [**2145**], Lg B-cell lymphoma [**2145**] s/p autosct, recurred '[**60**] and
   repeat sctp, MDS dx [**3-5**] by bm bx) and acute-on-chronic systolic CHF
   (EF30%) who comes to the ICU for shock and altered mental
   status/encephalopathy.  Her encephalopathy has improved (perhaps as a
   consequence of hemodynamic therapy).
   Shock
     * Now off pressors for about 22 hours
     * Tolerated diuresis yesterday with improved dyspnea
     * Cortisol (random) was indeterminate
 trying off steroids.
       Persistent improved blood pressure argues strongly against adrenal
       insufficiency.
     * I suspect that the dominant underlying etiology of her very
       difficult-to-manage hemodynamics is a very steep stroke volume vs.
       preload curve.  The most likely etiology of this is restrictive
       cardiomyopathy or constrictive pericardial disease.  She has shown
       that with too little preload she has symptomatic shock; with only a
       little more, she has pulmonary edema.  In addition, she may well
       have autonomic dysregulation leading to inability to increase her
       SVR.
   Fevers/infection
     * No specific identified site of infection, though sinuses are

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with a complicated oncologic history and acute-on-chronic systolic congestive heart failure (EF 30%). She was admitted to the ICU for shock and altered mental status/encephalopathy. The patient's encephalopathy has improved, and she is now off pressors for about 22 hours. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Shock: The patient had shock and required hemodynamic therapy. Although she is currently off pressors, there is a possibility of recurrence if her underlying etiology of hemodynamics is not properly managed.

2. Infection/Fever: The patient has fevers/infection, but no specific identified site of infection. She is currently on antibiotics and antifungals. Monitoring for any signs of infection and adjusting the treatment accordingly is important.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute and chronic systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%. Proper management of fluid balance and diuretic therapy is crucial to prevent exacerbation of CHF symptoms.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 47. Close monitoring of platelet levels and considering platelet transfusion when necessary is important.

5. LUE Swelling: The patient has left upper extremity swelling, but Doppler examination was"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypotension. They have been admitted to the ICU and are receiving various treatments, including vasopressor therapy, diuretics, and multiple antibiotics. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, iodine, and specific medications such as Reglan, Compazine, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and Acyclovir analogues. The patient has received several doses of antibiotics, including caspofungin, vancomycin, and meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and the use of multiple antibiotics suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis. This is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The low blood pressure may lead to reduced blood flow to vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, and brain. This can result in organ dysfunction or failure if not promptly addressed.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 756 mL over 24 hours. This indicates that there may be ongoing fluid losses or inadequate fluid resuscitation, which can contribute to hypotension and other complications.
4. Thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for developing thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), due to immobility and central venous cath"
