   This is a 69 year old woman with AML, s/p 7+3. day 15 of
   non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant, with PMH of
   bioprosthetic aortic valve, now in the ICU intubated after worsening
   mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload in
   the setting of acute renal failure and heart failure as well as recent
   VRE bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated yesterday for hypoxia and
   altered mental status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and
   renal failure.  Her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until
   these issues are resolved.
   - Continue AC Ventilation
   HEART FAILURE: The patient
s EF is 25-30% however the etiology of this
   rapid reduction is unclear, whether cardiomyopathy, viral or bacterial
   myocarditis or a contribution of dysrhythmia.  Our care will be support
   at this point to allow the process to resolve.
   - Continue Milrinone & Phenylephrine
   - Metoprolol for rapid rate (varying between Sinus Tach with APCs and
   Atrial fibrillation)
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.
   -HD line placed, to start CVVH today
   VRE BACTEREMIA:  Despite transient hypotension overnight after
   intubation, the patient does not display septic physiology. Known VRE
   bacteremia with line removed. Unclear if she has endocarditis, but as
   this will only effect long term duration of therapy and so is not
   acutely required.  Continues to be neutropenic.
   -  Linezolid for VRE (Also continuing Flagyl, Micafungin, Cefepime).
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered in
   excess of her baseline anxiety.  Differential diagnosis includes
   bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med
   effect, delerium of the critically ill.
   - medical management of precipitating causes
   - would hold off on antipsychotics for now

   Continuing post-allo transplant protocol per BMT recommendations.
   - holding tacrolimus

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who is currently in the ICU for various medical complications. She was admitted due to worsening mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has multiple lines, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multilumen line. The patient is also receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care for heart and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema. This condition occurs when excess fluid accumulates in the lungs, causing difficulty in breathing.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to several factors such as bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, medication effects, or delirium in critically ill patients.
3. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has an elevated body temperature, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory response.
4. Leukemia, Acute (ALL, AML, Cancer, Malignant Neoplasm): The patient has a known diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is currently undergoing treatment.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has a known VRE"

   This is a 69 year old woman with AML, s/p 7+3. day 15 of
   non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant, with PMH of
   bioprosthetic aortic valve, now in the ICU intubated after worsening
   mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload in
   the setting of acute renal failure and heart failure as well as recent
   VRE bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated yesterday for hypoxia and
   altered mental status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and
   renal failure.  Her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until
   these issues are resolved.
   - Continue AC Ventilation
   HEART FAILURE: The patient
s EF is 25-30% however the etiology of this
   rapid reduction is unclear, whether cardiomyopathy, viral or bacterial
   myocarditis or a contribution of dysrhythmia.  Our care will be support
   at this point to allow the process to resolve.
   - Continue Milrinone & Phenylephrine
   - Metoprolol for rapid rate (varying between Sinus Tach with APCs and
   Atrial fibrillation)
   VRE Bacteremia:  Despite transient hypotension overnight after
   intubation, the patient does not display septic physiology. Known VRE
   bacteremia.  SEPSIS: Neutropenic without fever, VRE Bacteremia, line
   removed with VRE growing.  Recent BCx still not positive after 48
   hours. hypotension & tachycardia requiring phenylephrine and
   milrinone.  Beta blocker now added to manage rebound tachycardia.
   Linezolid for VRE (Also Flagyl, Micafungin, Cefepime).
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Heart failure component, fluid overload. No
   response to Lasix gtt, HD line placed, to start on CVVH this morning.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:
   A number of possible precipitants including renal failure and
   hospitalization as well as emotionally stressful situation but the most
   likely major contributor, especially given acute worsening around [**6-12**],
   is VRE bacteremia.
   - medical management of precipitating causes
   - would hold off on antipsychotics for now
   - BMT team has held remeron and sertraline with concern for interaction
   with linezolid; may be that acute discontinuation of these ends up
   being more problem[**Name (NI) 595**] for mental status; can consider psych consult vs
   simply plan for restart once linezolid is complete
   - can give zyprexa and ativan for now for agitation
   AML
   Continuing post-allo transplant protocol per BMT recommendations.
   - holding tacrolimus

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a medical history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who has undergone a non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant. She is currently admitted to the ICU and is intubated due to worsening mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/62 mmHg to 74/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 35.4°C (95.8°F).

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 69 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, sodium level of 164 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.1 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL. The patient also has an elevated lactate level of 1.7 and elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST).

Imaging studies reveal a chest X-ray showing an endotracheal tube in place, poorly penetrated film, and signs of volume overload. An abdominal ultrasound shows gallbladder edema without evidence of acute cholecystitis, no secondary signs of hepatic occlusive disease, increased liver echogenicity consistent with fatty infiltration, and no evidence of obstruction as a cause"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant. She is currently in the ICU, intubated due to hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, delirium/confusion, fever, leukemia, bacteremia, acute renal failure, heart failure, and alkalosis. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to hypoxia and altered mental status.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%. The etiology of this rapid reduction is unclear, but it could be related to cardiomyopathy, viral or bacterial myocarditis, or dysrhythmia. The patient is being supported with medications such as milrinone and phenylephrine.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely due to fluid overload secondary to heart failure. Despite Lasix infusion, there was no response, so a hemodialysis line was placed.
4. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Linezolid is being administered to treat the infection.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing confusion and delirium, which may be caused by"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient is on invasive ventilation, indicating respiratory distress or failure. This could be a result of fluid overload, as suggested by the CXR showing a line in place ET tube and the patient appearing volume overloaded.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which is commonly seen in critically ill patients or those with sepsis.

3. Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia, not Fever of Unknown Origin): The patient has had multiple episodes of fever, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

4. Leukemia, Acute (ALL, AML, Cancer, Malignant Neoplasm): While not explicitly stated, the presence of pancytopenia (low WBC count, low Hct, low Plt) could be suggestive of an underlying hematological malignancy.

5. Bacteremia: The patient has multiple positive blood cultures for Enterococcus, suggesting bacteremia, which may be the cause of the fever and potential source of infection.

6. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient's renal function tests (Cr, BUN) indicate acute kidney injury, possibly due to sepsis or other factors.

   A number of possible precipitants including renal failure and
   hospitalization as well as emotionally stressful situation but the most

   is VRE bacteremia.
   - medical management of precipitating causes
   - would hold off on antipsychotics for now
   - BMT team has held remeron and sertraline with concern for interaction
   with linezolid; may be that acute discontinuation of these ends up
   being more problem[**Name (NI) 595**] for mental status; can consider psych consult vs
   simply plan for restart once linezolid is complete

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who has undergone a non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant. She is currently in the ICU with worsening mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload. The patient has acute renal failure and likely chronic heart failure. She also has recent vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Fluid overload from heart failure and renal failure may contribute to this condition.
2. VRE Sepsis: The patient has neutropenia without fever, VRE bacteremia, and line-related infection. This suggests the possibility of VRE sepsis.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension. These findings indicate acute heart failure on top of chronic heart failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to fluid overload secondary to heart failure.
5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be attributed to various factors such as renal failure, hospitalization, and VRE bacteremia.
6. Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia, Not Fever of Unknown Origin):"

   This is a 69 year old woman with AML, s/p 7+3. day 15 of
   non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant, with PMH of
   bioprosthetic aortic valve, now in the ICU intubated after worsening
   mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload in
   the setting of acute renal failure and heart failure as well as recent
   VRE bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated yesterday for hypoxia and
   altered mental status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and
   renal failure.  Her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until
   these issues are resolved.
   - Continue AC Ventilation
   HEART FAILURE: The patient
s EF is 25-30% however the etiology of this
   rapid reduction is unclear, whether cardiomyopathy, viral or bacterial
   myocarditis or a contribution of dysrhythmia.  Our care will be support
   at this point to allow the process to resolve.
   - Continue Milrinone & Phenylephrine
   - Metoprolol for rapid rate (varying between Sinus Tach with APCs and
   Atrial fibrillation)
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.
   -HD line placed, to start CVVH today
   VRE BACTEREMIA:  Despite transient hypotension overnight after
   intubation, the patient does not display septic physiology. Known VRE
   bacteremia with line removed. Unclear if she has endocarditis, but as
   this will only effect long term duration of therapy and so is not
   acutely required.  Continues to be neutropenic.
   -  Linezolid for VRE (Also continuing Flagyl, Micafungin, Cefepime).
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered in
   excess of her baseline anxiety.  Differential diagnosis includes
   bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med
   effect, delerium of the critically ill.
   - medical management of precipitating causes
   - would hold off on antipsychotics for now
   AML
   Continuing post-allo transplant protocol per BMT recommendations.
   - holding tacrolimus
   - continue CellCept
   - filgrastim per BMT recs

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant on 05/28/2145.
- She is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including heart failure, acute renal failure, VRE bacteremia, neutropenia, pulmonary edema, delirium, and leukemia.
- She is being treated with various medications and interventions to manage her conditions, including linezolid for VRE bacteremia, milrinone for heart failure, and CVVH for acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization and underlying malignancy increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and medications.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can be a complication of ICU stay and multiple organ dysfunction.

   mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload in
   the setting of acute renal failure and heart failure as well as recent
   VRE bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated yesterday for hypoxia and
   altered mental status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and
   renal failure.  Her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until
   these issues are resolved.
   - Continue AC Ventilation
   HEART FAILURE: The patient
s EF is 25-30% however the etiology of this
   rapid reduction is unclear, whether cardiomyopathy, viral or bacterial
   myocarditis or a contribution of dysrhythmia.  Our care will be support
   at this point to allow the process to resolve.
   - Continue Milrinone & Phenylephrine
   - Metoprolol for rapid rate (varying between Sinus Tach with APCs and
   Atrial fibrillation)
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.
   -HD line placed, to start CVVH today
   VRE BACTEREMIA:  Despite transient hypotension overnight after
   intubation, the patient does not display septic physiology. Known VRE
   bacteremia with line removed. Unclear if she has endocarditis, but as
   this will only effect long term duration of therapy and so is not
   acutely required.  Continues to be neutropenic.
   -  Linezolid for VRE (Also continuing Flagyl, Micafungin, Cefepime).
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered in
   excess of her baseline anxiety.  Differential diagnosis includes
   bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med
   effect, delerium of the critically ill.
   - medical management of precipitating causes

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant. She is currently in the ICU intubated after experiencing worsening mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxic respiratory failure, heart failure, acute renal failure, VRE bacteremia, neutropenia, pulmonary edema, delirium/confusion, and altered mental status. The patient's condition requires ongoing critical care management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory issues are likely to persist until her heart and renal failure are resolved.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%. The etiology of this rapid reduction is unclear, and supportive care will be provided to allow the process to resolve.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is anuric, indicating a lack of urine production. This suggests acute renal failure, which may be due to direct renal injury from chemotherapy or poor forward flow.
4. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has known VRE bacteremia, and appropriate antibiotics (linezolid) are being administered.
5. Neutropenia: The patient remains neutropenic despite receiving antineoplastic therapy.
6. Pulmonary Edema: The patient"

   mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload in
   the setting of acute renal failure and heart failure as well as recent
   VRE bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated yesterday for hypoxia and
   altered mental status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and
   renal failure.  Her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until
   these issues are resolved.
   - Continue AC Ventilation
   HEART FAILURE: The patient
s EF is 25-30% however the etiology of this
   rapid reduction is unclear, whether cardiomyopathy, viral or bacterial
   myocarditis or a contribution of dysrhythmia.  Our care will be support
   at this point to allow the process to resolve.
   - Continue Milrinone & Phenylephrine & metoprolol per HF team recs;
   goal MAP of 55-65 to minimize afterload
   - Metoprolol for rapid rate (varying between Sinus Tach with APCs and
   Atrial fibrillation)
   - minimize fluid intake to maximize net volume reduction
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.

   VRE BACTEREMIA:  Despite transient hypotension overnight after
   intubation, the patient does not display septic physiology. Known VRE
   bacteremia with line removed. Unclear if she has endocarditis, but as
   this will only effect long term duration of therapy and so is not
   acutely required.  Continues to be neutropenic.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant.
- She is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and altered mental status.
- The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, heart failure, VRE bacteremia, neutropenia, pulmonary edema, and delirium.
- She is receiving various medications and treatments to manage these conditions, including vasopressors, inotropes, antibiotics, and dialysis.
- The patient's prognosis is guarded due to her complex medical conditions and the need for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to being intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment if necessary is important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and early mobilization should be implemented.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and underlying medical conditions increase the risk of delirium. Frequent reassessment of cognitive function, provision of a calm environment, and avoidance of unnecessary medications can help manage this complication.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant. She is currently in the ICU, intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation, hypotension, VRE bacteremia, heart failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. She is also neutropenic and has a low platelet count. The patient's medical history includes a bioprosthetic aortic valve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxia and altered mental status. It is important to optimize ventilation settings and ensure adequate oxygenation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed with antiarrhythmic medications such as amiodarone and metoprolol. Cardioversion attempts have been unsuccessful so far.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to cardiogenic shock from heart failure or sepsis from VRE bacteremia. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support with milrinone and phenylephrine are being administered.
4. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has known VRE bacteremia, and appropriate antibiotics, such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of bone marrow transplant, currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities including delirium, acute renal failure, bacteremia with VRE, neutropenia, pulmonary edema, fever, leukemia, tachycardia, heart failure, and metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition requires mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic heart failure with severely depressed ejection fraction, and the use of inotropes like milrinone may increase the risk of arrhythmias.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric, indicating acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to immunosuppression from the bone marrow transplant and neutropenia. Bacteremia with VRE has already been identified, and there is a concern for misdrawn or contaminated blood samples.
5. Bleeding: The patient has an elevated INR and prolonged PTT, indicating a risk for bleeding complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary.
6. Metabolic Imbalance: The patient has respiratory alkalosis, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid complications such as seizures or arr"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old woman with AML, s/p 7+3. day 15 of
   non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant, with PMH of
   bioprosthetic aortic valve, now in the ICU intubated after worsening
   mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload in
   the setting of acute renal failure and heart failure as well as recent
   VRE bacteremia.  She had a very difficult night with unstable atrial
   fibrillation.  As of the time of this note, she is still on large doses
   of pressors and requires intensive management.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated for hypoxia and altered mental
   status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and renal failure,
   fluid boluses overnight.  Her respiratory issues will not likely
   resolve until these issues are resolved.
   - Continue AC Ventilation, CVVH as able
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with a
   rate of 140s, compromising her forward flow and resulting blood
   pressure.  She received unsuccessful cardioversion and termporarily
   successful amiodarone loading.
   - Continue metoprolol 10mg IV q4
   - Reload amiodarone 150mg/30 minutes, 1mg x6 hours, 0.5mg x 18 hours
   - Cardioversion as needed for hemodynamic stability
   HYPOTENSION: Atrial fibrillation plus diffuse inflammatory response
   from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock.
   Currently with very high phenylephrine requirements.
   - Fluid boluses of 250mL as needed
   - Rate control of Atrial fibrillation as above
   - Continue phenylephrine as needed for goal MAPs 50-60, titrating down
   throughout the day as possible
   - Hydrocort 100mg IV x1, with Methylprenisolone 40mg IV BID thereafter
   - Hold CVVH until pressures stabilize
   VRE BACTEREMIA:  Continues to be neutropenic, not clearly septic.  Now
   engrafting.
   -  Linezolid for VRE (Also continuing Flagyl, Micafungin, Cefepime).
   - Of note cefepime completes 2 week course today for previous ecoli
   bactermia
no plan to stop given grave condition
   HEART FAILURE: The patient
s EF is 25-30%
   - Continue Milrinone & Phenylephrine & metoprolol per HF team recs;
   goal MAP of 55-65 to minimize afterload
   - Metoprolol for rapid rate (varying between Sinus Tach with APCs and
   Atrial fibrillation)
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.
   -Continue CVVH as tolerated by BP
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered in
   excess of her baseline anxiety.  Differential diagnosis includes
   bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med
   effect, delerium of the critically ill.
   - medical management of precipitating causes
   - would hold off on antipsychotics for now
   - will wean sedation for rpt neurologic eval in afternoon as pt with
   minimal pupil consstriction and upgoing toes currently.
   AML
   Continuing post-allo transplant protocol per BMT recommendations.
   - Hold tacrolimus per BMT
   - continue CellCept
   - filgrastim per BMT recs
   - abx as above
   - transfuse platelets >20, or greater when procedures are contemplated;
   transfuse Hct >25
   Coagulopathy: INR trending up slowly. Will give Vit K and follow. Seems
   out of proportion to liver impairment. Likely contribution from poor
   nutritional status
   Transaminitis: T. Bili resolved very quickly, repeating labs

","The patient is a 69-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant on day 15. She has a medical history of bioprosthetic aortic valve and is currently in the ICU intubated due to worsening mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and fluid overload in the setting of acute renal failure and heart failure, as well as recent vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia.

The patient has multiple medical complications including:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxia and altered mental status. She remains fluid overloaded from heart and renal failure, and fluid boluses were given overnight. Her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until these issues are resolved.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate, compromising her forward flow and resulting in low blood pressure. She received unsuccessful cardioversion and temporary successful amiodarone loading. She is being continued on metoprolol, amiodarone, and may require another cardioversion if hemodynamically unstable.

3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension due to atrial fibrillation and diffuse inflammatory response from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. She is currently on high-dose phenylephrine for blood pressure support and will be titrated down throughout the day as possible.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 69 yo lady with AML s/p 7+3 induction, DCB allo transplant with
   cardiac and renal failure resulting in hypervolemia, respiratory
   failure and worsening mental status.  She had a fairly calm evening
   overnight with no significant changes in her hemodynamics and a
   decreased pressor requirement.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated for hypoxia and altered mental
   status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and renal failure,
   fluid boluses overnight.  Her respiratory issues will not likely
   resolve until these issues are resolved.
   - Continue AC Ventilation, CVVH with goal fluid removal today as the
   patient is more stable
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with a
   rate of 140s, compromising her forward flow and resulting blood
   pressure.  She received unsuccessful cardioversion and termporarily
   successful amiodarone loading.  After her second Amiodarone load
   yesterday the patient has converted to a normal sinus rhythm.
   - Continue metoprolol 10mg IV q4
   - Amiodarone load completes this morning, will continue 200mg per OG
   tube [**Hospital1 7**]
   HYPOTENSION: Atrial fibrillation plus diffuse inflammatory response
   from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. With
   the administration of steroids and rate correction, the patient
   hemodynamics have markedly improved.  She is currently requiring small
   amounts of milrinone and phenylephrine, mostly to sustain CVVH.
   - Continue phenylephrine as needed for goal MAPs 50-60, titrating down
   throughout the day as possible
   - Methylprenisolone 40mg IV BID
   HEART FAILURE: The patient
s EF is 25-30% with etiology either
   chemotherapy or infectious.  Her Svo2
s have improved, implying an
   increase in cardiac output on a consistent dose of milrinone.  In
   addition, her decreasing phenylephrine requirements allow for improved
   forward flow.
   - Continue Milrinone & Phenylephrine & metoprolol per HF team recs;
   goal MAP of 55-65 to minimize afterload
   - Metoprolol for atrial fibrilaltion control
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.
   -Continue CVVH as tolerated by BP
   VRE BACTEREMIA:  Continues to be neutropenic, not clearly septic.  Now
   engrafting.
   -  Linezolid for VRE (Also continuing Flagyl, Micafungin, Cefepime).
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered in
   excess of her baseline anxiety.  Differential diagnosis includes
   bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med
   effect, delerium of the critically ill.
   - medical management of precipitating causes
   - would hold off on antipsychotics for now
   - will wean sedation for rpt neurologic eval in afternoon as pt with
   minimal pupil consstriction and upgoing toes currently.
   AML
   Continuing post-allo transplant protocol per BMT recommendations.
   - Hold tacrolimus per BMT, continue Methylprednisolone
   - continue CellCept
   - filgrastim per BMT recs
   - abx as above
   - transfuse platelets >20, or greater when procedures are contemplated;
   transfuse Hct >25
   Coagulopathy: INR trending up slowly. Will give Vit K and follow. Seems
   out of proportion to liver impairment. Likely contribution from poor
   nutritional status
   Transaminitis: LFTs increased slightly from yesterday, unclear
   significance but not likely hypoxic/shock, no new infections or toxic
   medication effect.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old lady who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has a history of cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia, respiratory failure, and worsening mental status. The patient was intubated for hypoxia and altered mental status. She remains fluid overloaded due to heart and renal failure. Her respiratory issues are not likely to resolve until these issues are addressed. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient developed respiratory failure, leading to intubation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate, compromising her forward flow and blood pressure. She received amiodarone loading, which temporarily converted her to a normal sinus rhythm.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure due to atrial fibrillation and diffuse inflammatory response from engraftment, causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. Steroids and rate correction improved her hemodynamics.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction is estimated to be 25-30%, likely caused by chemotherapy or infection. Her cardiac output has improved with the consistent use of milrinone.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, indicated by granular casts and direct renal injury from chemotherapy or poor forward flow. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old lady with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a 7+3 induction therapy and a double cord blood (DCB) allogeneic stem cell transplant. She is currently in the ICU due to cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia, respiratory failure, and worsening mental status. The patient's respiratory issues are unlikely to resolve until her fluid overload from heart and renal failure is addressed. She has also developed atrial fibrillation, which has been managed with amiodarone and has converted to normal sinus rhythm. The patient's hypotension is due to a combination of atrial fibrillation and diffuse inflammatory response from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. Her heart failure is believed to be caused by chemotherapy or infectious etiology, with an estimated ejection fraction of 25-30%. The patient's acute renal failure is indicated by granular casts, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to direct renal injury from chemotherapy or poor forward flow. She has VRE bacteremia and continues to be neutropenic. The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to various factors, including bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, medication effects, or delirium of the critically ill.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 69 yo lady with AML s/p 7+3 induction, DCB allo transplant with
   cardiac and renal failure resulting in hypervolemia, respiratory
   failure and worsening mental status.  She had a fairly calm evening
   overnight with no significant changes in her hemodynamics and a
   decreased pressor requirement.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated for hypoxia and altered mental
   status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and renal failure,
   fluid boluses overnight.  Her respiratory issues will not likely
   resolve until these issues are resolved.
   - Continue AC Ventilation, CVVH with goal fluid removal today as the
   patient is more stable
   HYPOTENSION: Atrial fibrillation plus diffuse inflammatory response
   from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. With
   the administration of steroids and rate correction, the patient
   hemodynamics have markedly improved.  She is currently requiring small
   amounts of milrinone and phenylephrine, mostly to sustain CVVH.
   - Continue phenylephrine as needed for goal MAPs 50-60, weaning to 0 as
   tolerated.
   - Methylprenisolone 40mg IV BID
   HEART FAILURE: The patient
s EF is 25-30% with etiology either
   chemotherapy or infectious.  Her Svo2
s have improved, implying an
   increase in cardiac output on a consistent dose of milrinone.  In
   addition, her decreasing phenylephrine requirements allow for improved
   forward flow.
   - Continue Milrinone & Phenylephrine & metoprolol per HF team recs;
   goal MAP of 55-65 to minimize afterload
   - Amiodarone for Afib control
   VRE BACTEREMIA:  Continues to be neutropenic, not clearly septic.
   Cultures from [**6-14**] are now positive for GPCs, concerning for continue
   enterococcus.
   -  Linezolid for VRE (Also continuing Flagyl, Micafungin, Cefepime)
   - Surveillance Cultures
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient remains in normal sinus rhythm while
   on Amiodarone.
   - Hold metoprolol while on amiodarone
   - Continue Amiodarone 0.5mg/min while unable to tolerate POs
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.
   -Continue CVVH as tolerated by BP
   AML
   Continuing post-allo transplant protocol per BMT recommendations.
   - Hold tacrolimus per BMT, continue Methylprednisolone: Checking levels
   today to titrate new dose (transmucosal powder with goal level [**5-27**])
   - continue CellCept
   - filgrastim per BMT recs
   - transfuse platelets >20, or greater when procedures are contemplated;
   transfuse Hct >25
   Transaminitis: T. Bili trending up with other LFTs resolving, concern
   for hemolysis from CVVH versus intra hepatic/cholestatic process.
   - RUQ U/S today
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered in
   excess of her baseline anxiety.  Differential diagnosis includes
   bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med
   effect, delerium of the critically ill.
   - medical management of precipitating causes
   - would hold off on antipsychotics for now

The patient is a 69-year-old lady with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a 7+3 induction and then received a double cord blood allogeneic transplant. She has cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia, respiratory failure, and worsening mental status. The patient was intubated for hypoxia and altered mental status. She remains fluid overloaded due to heart and renal failure, and her respiratory issues are unlikely to resolve until these issues are addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to persist until her fluid overload from heart and renal failure is managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension due to atrial fibrillation and diffuse inflammatory response from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. She is currently on small amounts of milrinone and phenylephrine to sustain continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30% with an etiology either chemotherapy or infection. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation (Svo2) has improved, indicating an increase in cardiac output on a consistent dose of milrinone. However, her decreasing phenylephrine requirements suggest improved forward flow.
4. VRE Bacteremia: The patient continues to be neutrop"

   decreased pressor requirement.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated for hypoxia and altered mental
   status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and renal failure,
   fluid boluses overnight.  Her respiratory issues will not likely
   resolve until these issues are resolved.
   - Continue AC Ventilation, CVVH with goal fluid removal today as the
   patient is more stable
   HYPOTENSION: Atrial fibrillation plus diffuse inflammatory response
   from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. With
   the administration of steroids and rate correction, the patient
   hemodynamics have markedly improved.  She is currently requiring small
   amounts of milrinone and phenylephrine, mostly to sustain CVVH.
   - Continue phenylephrine as needed for goal MAPs 50-60, weaning to 0 as
   tolerated.
   - Methylprenisolone 40mg IV BID
   HEART FAILURE: The patient
s EF is 25-30% with etiology either
   chemotherapy or infectious.  Her Svo2
s have improved, implying an
   increase in cardiac output on a consistent dose of milrinone.  In
   addition, her decreasing phenylephrine requirements allow for improved

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old lady with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a double cord blood stem cell transplantation. She is currently in the ICU due to cardiac and renal failure resulting in hypervolemia, respiratory failure, and worsening mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, delirium/confusion, acute renal failure, bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), neutropenia, pulmonary edema, fever, leukemia, tachycardia, heart failure, and alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and altered mental status. The respiratory issues will not likely resolve until the underlying heart and renal failures are addressed.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status is altered, making it difficult to assess her condition accurately. This could be due to various factors such as bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, medication effects, or delirium of the critically ill.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has anuria and requires hemodialysis. The cause of acute renal failure could be related to chemotherapy, poor forward flow, or direct renal injury.
4. Bacteremia with VRE: The patient has a confirmed VRE bacteremia and is being treated with linezolid. Surveillance cultures"

   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient remains in normal sinus rhythm while

   course of day which is approx 0.25mg/min
can continue this dose for one
   week (starting [**2145-6-19**]).  Possible drug interaction with tacro,
   boosting tacro levels.
   - Holding metoprolol while on amiodarone
   - Continue Amiodarone 0.25mg/min while unable to tolerate POs, switch
   to PO when possible.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.
   -Continue CVVH as tolerated by BP
   AML
   Continuing post-allo transplant protocol per BMT recommendations.
   - Hold tacrolimus per BMT, continue Methylprednisolone: tacro levels
   still elevated (amio interaction?); once tacro levels dip, may need
   transmucosal preparation per BMT
   - continue CellCept
   - filgrastim per BMT recs
   - transfuse platelets >20, or greater when procedures are contemplated;
   transfuse Hct >25
   Transaminitis: T. Bili trending up with other LFTs resolving, concern
   for hemolysis from CVVH versus intra hepatic/cholestatic process.
   - RUQ U/S  non-diagnostic
   - trend further, CT if worsening
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered in
   excess of her baseline anxiety.  Differential diagnosis includes
   bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old lady with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a double cord blood stem cell transplant (allo transplant). She is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She also has acute cardiac and renal failure, leading to fluid overload. Other medical complications include bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), neutropenia, pulmonary edema, fever, tachycardia, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), and alkalosis. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, cardiac inotropes, vasopressors, and immunosuppressants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure due to underlying cardiac and renal issues.

2. Cardiac Failure: The patient has acute systolic and diastolic heart failure with severely depressed ejection fraction (25-30%). There is a risk of worsening cardiac function leading to cardiogenic shock.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric, indicating acute renal failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, potentially necessitating renal replacement therapy.

4. Infection: The patient has bacteremia with VRE, which may not clear without appropriate treatment. There is a risk of progression"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old lady with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent an allogeneic double cord blood stem cell transplantation (allo double cord SCT). She is currently in the ICU for various complications. The patient has multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, heart failure, renal failure, bacteremia, neutropenia, pulmonary edema, fever, tachycardia, and delirium. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and an elevated temperature. Her laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, immunosuppressants, and cardiac support drugs. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory issues may not resolve until the fluid overload from heart and renal failure is addressed. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) is being used to manage fluid overload and correct electrolyte imbalances.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure with severely depressed ejection fraction. She requires cardiac support with milrinone and phenylephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old lady with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a double cord blood stem cell transplant.
- She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, bacteremia with VRE, neutropenia, pulmonary edema, fever, tachycardia, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), and delirium.
- She also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with amiodarone.
- The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in electrolytes, liver function tests, and kidney function.
- She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and immunosuppressants.
- The patient's fluid balance and nutrition are also a concern, with high tube feed residuals and ongoing fluid removal through continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
- The patient's sodium levels are low and need monitoring.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and various interventions are being implemented to address her different medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The presence of bacteremia with VRE and neutropenia increases the risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a double cord blood stem cell transplant on 05/28/2145. She presented to the ICU with respiratory failure due to volume overload and subsequent hypoxia, requiring intubation. The patient also has acute renal failure, neutropenia, bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and other complications such as delirium, confusion, and a history of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 116/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. Her current medications include amiodarone, fentanyl, midazolam, and various other medications for her multiple medical conditions.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL and leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL. The patient's renal function is compromised with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   69F w AML s/p 7+3 induction, DCB allo transplant with cardiac and renal
   failure resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure
   requiring intubaion and worsening mental status.
   # HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated for hypoxia and altered mental
   status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and renal failure.
   Her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until these issues are
   resolved.
   - Vent mode switched to pressure support
   - CVVH with goal fluid removal
   - d/w renal possible HD
   # HYPOTENSION: Cardioenic Shock mixed with diffuse inflammatory
   response from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive
   shock. Improved with steriods and afib control. Weaned off
   milrinone/phenylephrine.
   - Continuing Methylprenisolone 40mg IV BID, discuss duration with BMT.
   # VRE BACTEREMIA: Continues to be neutropenic, not clearly septic. Will
   need return of counts. Enterococcus bacterimia seen last on [**6-14**].
   - Linezolid for VRE
   - surveillance cxs if febrile or unstable
   - awaiting results of TTE, consider TEE to r/o endocariditis
   - ID recs
   # PANCYTOPENIA: WBC stable at 0.1. Given 1 unit of plts. Hct of 25
   today, however, trying to remove fluid with CVVH, and no current sign
   of bleeding. Due to AMS and neutropenia was started on flagyl,
   micafungin, cefepime, and linezolid
   - continue on mica, cefe, and linezolid until counts improve for 2 week
   course
   - BMT recs
   - monitor ANC
   - on filgrastim per BMT recs
   - will transfuse platelets <20, or greater when procedures are
   contemplated;
   - transfuse Hct >24 or unstable
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: In sinus rhythm while on Amiodarone.
   Bioavailabilty of po is half of IV. Possible drug interaction with
   tacro, boosting tacro levels.
   - continue 0.25mg/min for seven days, (last day [**2145-6-25**]), then discuss
   with cards PO dosing or decreased IV dose.
   - d/w cards stopping amiodarone
   - Holding metoprolol while on amiodarone.
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated by BP
   - Consider HD
   - Goal negative 1 liter today
   # AML: Continuing post-allo transplant protocol per BMT
   recommendations.
   - Hold tacrolimus per BMT, once tacro levels dip, may need transmucosal
   preparation per BMT
   - continue Methylprednisolone
   - continue CellCept
   - BMT recs
   # TRANSAMINITIS: T. Bili trending up with other LFTs resolving, concern
   for hemolysis from CVVH versus intra hepatic/cholestatic process. RUQ
   U/S  non-diagnostic Also high tube feed residuls, concern for
   obstruction
   - trend further, CT if worsening
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered
   in excess of her baseline anxiety.  Differential diagnosis includes
   bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med
   effect, delerium of the critically ill.
   - medical management of precipitating causes
   - would hold off on antipsychotics for now
   - decreased sedation to see if more responsive
   - d/c fentanyl for now
   - d/w neuro
   # HYPONATREMIA: Na was 127, now at 131, has been stable for last
   several days, but lower then baseline. Likely secondary to hypervolemic
   hyponatremia
   - monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Na
   - correct with CVVH

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a 7+3 induction chemotherapy followed by a double cord blood allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-transplant). She presented with cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure requiring intubation and worsening mental status. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for hypoxia and altered mental status. Her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until her cardiac and renal issues are addressed.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock mixed with diffuse inflammatory response from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. She has improved with steroids and control of atrial fibrillation but remains hypotensive. 
3. VRE bacteremia: The patient continues to be neutropenic, not clearly septic. She has a history of enterococcus bacteremia seen last on 06/14. 
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count (WBC), stable at 0.1. She received one unit of platelets and her hematocrit (Hct) is 25. However, fluid removal with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being attempted, and there are no current signs of bleeding.

   failure resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure
   requiring intubaion and worsening mental status.
   # HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated for hypoxia and altered mental
   status.  She remains fluid overloaded from heart and renal failure.
   Her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until these issues are
   resolved.
   - attempting to transition to haloperidone from sedation
   - Vent mode switched to pressure support
   - CVVH with goal of large volume fluid removal
   # HYPOTENSION: Cardiogenic shock mixed with diffuse inflammatory
   response from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive
   shock. Improved with steroids and afib control. Weaned off
   milrinone/phenylephrine.
   - Continuing Methylprenisolone 40mg IV BID, discuss duration with BMT.
   # VRE BACTEREMIA: Continues to be neutropenic, not clearly septic. Will
   need return of counts. Enterococcus bacteremia seen last on [**6-14**].
   - Linezolid for VRE (abx-course depends on ? endocarditis)
   - surveillance cxs if febrile or unstable
   - TEE today to eval for endocarditis
   - ID recs
   # PANCYTOPENIA: WBC stable at 0.1. Given 1 unit of plts. Hct of 25
   today, however, trying to remove fluid with CVVH, and no current sign
   of bleeding. Due to AMS and neutropenia was started on flagyl,
   micafungin, cefepime, and linezolid
   - continue on mica, cefe, and linezolid until counts improve for 2 week
   course
   - BMT recs
   - monitor ANC
   - on filgrastim per BMT recs
   - will transfuse platelets <20, or greater when procedures are
   contemplated;
   - transfuse Hct >24 or unstable
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: In sinus rhythm while on Amiodarone, stopped due
   to interaction w tacro. Currently in SR off amiodarone.
   - monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Granular casts indicate ATN, direct renal injury
   from ? chemotherapy, poor forward flow.
   - Continue CVVH as tolerated by BP
   - Consider HD
   # AML: Continuing post-allo transplant protocol per BMT
   recommendations.
   - continue Methylprednisolone
   - continue CellCept
   - BMT recs
   # TRANSAMINITIS: T. Bili trending up with other LFTs resolving, concern
   for hemolysis from CVVH versus intra hepatic/cholestatic process. RUQ
   U/S  non-diagnostic Also high tube feed residuls, concern for
   obstruction
   - trend further, CT if worsening
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Ddx includes bacteremia, sepsis, renal
   failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med effect, delerium of the
   critically ill.
   - medical management of precipitating causes
   - MRI brain w/o contrast to eval for acute processes
   - transition to antipsychotics from sedation
   # HYPONATREMIA: Na in the high 120s, has been stable for last several
   days, but lower then baseline. Likely secondary to hypervolemic
   hyponatremia
   - monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Na
   - correct with CVVH

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a 7+3 induction and subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplant. She has been experiencing cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient remains fluid overloaded from heart and renal failure, and her respiratory issues will not likely resolve until these issues are resolved.
2. Hypotension: The patient has cardiogenic shock mixed with diffuse inflammatory response from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. She has been improved with steroids and atrial fibrillation control, but may require further management.
3. VRE Bacteremia: The patient is still neutropenic and not clearly septic. She has a history of enterococcus bacteremia seen last on [**6-14**]. She is currently on linezolid for VRE and will need return of counts. Enterococcus bacteremia surveillance cultures if febrile or unstable, TEE today to evaluate for endocarditis, and ID recommendations.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is stable at 0.1, and she has received one unit of platelets. Her hemoglobin concentration is 25 today, and she is trying to"

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a 7+3 induction therapy and subsequently received a donor cell transplant. She has a history of cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure requiring intubation. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, for which she is intubated. She is also experiencing cardiogenic shock mixed with diffuse inflammatory response from engraftment causing mixed cardiogenic and distributive shock. Her blood culture shows ongoing bacteremia with Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). 

She is neutropenic and has pancytopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.1. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level is 25.0. She is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including linezolid for VRE, micafungin, cefepime, and flagyl. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation and acute renal failure with granular casts indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is also a candidate for hemodialysis (HD). 

Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and there is concern for hepatic involvement. She has altered mental status due to possible bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is currently in the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, and acute renal failure. She has multiple comorbidities including heart failure, chronic anemia, neutropenia, bacteremia, pulmonary edema, and delirium. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been receiving various medications including sedatives, antibiotics, antifungals, and antiarrhythmics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Ventilator-associated events (VAEs)
3. Delirium
4. Sepsis
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI)
6. Arrhythmias
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
8. Stress ulcers
9. Hypotension
10. Hypoxemia

Further evaluation and management should focus on addressing these potential complications while also considering the patient's underlying malignancy and post-transplant status."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a double cord allo stem cell transplant (SCT) due to cardiac and renal failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, fluid overload, and altered mental status. The patient also has VRE bacteremia, pancytopenia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and transaminitis. She is receiving various medications and treatments, including CVVH, HD, antibiotics, antifungals, and immunosuppressants. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory issues will not likely resolve until her fluid overload and cardiac/renal issues are addressed.
2. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has a history of Enterococcus bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and low hemoglobin levels make her susceptible to infections and bleeding complications.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregular heartbeat increases the risk of clot formation, which can lead to stroke or other complications.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. This can result in further complications if not managed appropriately.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone a double cord stem cell transplant. She presents with multiple medical complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive and intubated. There are several possible causes for her altered mental status, including delirium, respiratory failure, sepsis, uremia, underlying malignancy, medication effects, or hypoxic encephalopathy.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient required intubation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by fluid overload and acute stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

3. Acute systolic heart failure (ASHF): The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased from 55% to 25-30% following chemotherapy and further decreased to 40% on echocardiography. This suggests chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity leading to ASHF.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric and has temporary hemodialysis (HD) access placed. She likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension and poor forward flow, or direct renal injury from chemotherapy.

5. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia and previously had E. coli bacteremia. She is currently neutropenic with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 0. She is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a double cord allo stem cell transplantation on 05/28/2009. She is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure, acute cardiac failure, acute renal failure, bacteremia, pancytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated since 06/15 and is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. She is also on CVVH for fluid removal and sedation weaning to assess neurological function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already acute and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a potential for further deterioration or complications related to the ventilator.

2. Cardiac Failure: The patient has had acute systolic heart failure due to chemotherapy and is currently being managed with fluid removal through CVVH. There is a risk of worsening cardiac function or development of arrhythmias.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension/poor forward flow or direct renal injury from chemotherapy. She is anuric and has a temporary hemodialysis line placed. There is a risk of further deterioration of renal function or the need for permanent dialysis.

4. Bacteremia: The patient has VRE bacteremia and has been on linezolid. She also had a previous episode of E. coli bacteremia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a double cord allo stem cell transplantation (SCT) on 5/28/09. She has been experiencing cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure requiring intubation. She also has altered mental status, pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and hypotension. She has a history of bacteremia with VRE and E. coli, and is currently neutropenic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to her hypervolemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, and efforts are being made to decrease sedation and transition to haloperidol while continuing fluid removal via continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

2. Cardiac failure: The patient has developed acute systolic heart failure (ASHF) as a result of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has decreased from baseline levels. Fluid removal via CVVH and repeat transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) will be necessary to reassess heart function.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) likely due to either hypotension/poor forward"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a double cord allo stem cell transplant (SCT) on 05/28/2009. She presented with cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure, requiring intubation and worsening mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, acute renal failure, bacteremia, pancytopenia, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, AML, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen due to ongoing fluid overload and acute systolic heart failure. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are necessary.

2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: There is a risk of further deterioration in cardiac function due to ongoing chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. Regular assessment of cardiac function through echocardiography and close monitoring of fluid balance are important.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate if fluid removal through CVVH is inadequate or if there is a lack of response to hemodialysis. Close monitoring of renal parameters and adjustment of treatment accordingly are crucial.

4. Bacteremia: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis or endocarditis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a double cord allo stem cell transplant (SCT) on 5/28/9. She is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. 

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemia due to volume overload and acute stress-induced myocardial injury, leading to acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She is mechanically ventilated on pressure support and undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) to improve respiratory status.

2. Acute Systolic CHF: The patient's baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 55%, which decreased to 25-30% after chemotherapy. Her current LVEF is 40% as per the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Fluid removal through CVVH and repeated TTE assessments are planned to reassess heart function.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has anuria and temporary hemodialysis (HD) line placement on 6/15. She likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension/poor forward flow or direct renal injury from chemotherapy. CVVH is being continued, and a plan is in place to switch to HD early next week.

4. Bacteremia: The patient had VRE bacteremia seen last on 6/14 and a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a double cord allo stem cell transplant (SCT) on 05/28/2009. She presented to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), bacteremia, and pancytopenia. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated on pressure support. She has been receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to manage fluid overload and improve respiratory status. The patient's cardiac function has improved, but she remains anuric and requires temporary hemodialysis. She also has a history of bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and Escherichia coli, which is currently being treated with daptomycin and cefepime, respectively. The patient is neutropenic due to recent chemotherapy and is at risk for opportunistic infections. She is also experiencing altered mental status with an unclear etiology, which may be related to bacteremia, sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, medication effects, or delirium of the critically ill. An MRI brain showed mastoiditis but otherwise unremarkable. A lumbar puncture was performed to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient has"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone a double cord allo stem cell transplant (SCT) on 05/28/09. The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications including cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure. 

The patient's medical history indicates that she has had chemotherapy, which has led to a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from 55% to 25-30%. Currently, her LVEF is 40% as per a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed on 06/22. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension/poor forward flow or direct renal injury from chemotherapy. She is anuric and a temporary hemodialysis (HD) line was placed on 06/15. 

Additionally, the patient has bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) seen last on 06/14, and a previous history of Escherichia coli bacteremia on 06/03. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) performed on 06/24 was negative for endocarditis. The patient is neutropenic and currently receiving daptomycin for VRE and cefepime"

   -          Restart Linezolid given Dapto resistance
   -          f/u BMT, ID Recs
   -          Will change out CVLs
   # Acute HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Hypoxemia for volume overload and
   AMS on [**6-15**]. Fluid overload [**2-22**] acute sCHF and ARF.
   -  Continue Pressure Support
   -  Check EKG daily while on haloperidol
   -  Volume removal by CVVH to improve respiratory status
   # ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF: Likely [**2-22**] Chemotherapy. LVEF 55% at baseline,
   but decreased to 25-30% w chemo, now w some recovery
 LVEF 40% on TTE
   [**6-22**].
   - Continue fluid removal w CVVH
   - Will repeat TTE today
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Secondary to ATN from hypotension/poor forward
   flow (given granular casts) vs direct renal injury from chemotherapy.
   Pt anuric; temporary HD line placed [**6-15**].
   -  Continue fluid removal w CVVH
   -  Plan to switch to HD early next week
   # BACTEREMIA: VRE Bacteremia seen last on [**6-14**], also h/o E. coli
   bacteremia [**6-3**]. TEE [**6-24**] negative for endocarditis. Currently
   neutropenic.
   - Previously on Daptomycin for VRE, Cefepime for GNR, restarting
   Linezolid
 course to continue for 2 weeks after normal ANC
   - check weekly CK w daptomycin (baselin Ck = 70 on [**6-26**])
   - surveillance cxs if febrile or unstable
   - ID recs
   # PANCYTOPENIA: [**2-22**] chemotherapy. Stopped linezolid on [**6-25**] due to bone
   marrow toxicity
   - daptomycin  for VRE, cefepime for GNR

   weeks after normal ANC
   - micafungin for fungal ppx
   - filgrastim for bone marrow stimulation
   - monitor ANC, Hct, PLTs daily
   - will transfuse platelets <20, or greater when procedures are
   contemplated;
   - transfuse Hct <24 or unstable
   - neutropenic precautions
   - BMT recs
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. DDx includes bacteremia,
   sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med effect,
   delerium of the critically ill. MRI brain w/o contrast [**6-24**]
   ?mastoiditis, otherwise unremarkable.
   - LP to evaluate CSF
   - transition to antipsychotics from sedation, check daily EKG w
   haloperidol
   - consider neuro c/s if no improvement
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: paroxysmal, likely [**2-22**] stress of acute illness.
   S/p amiodarone, stopped b/c interaction w tacrolimus. Currently in
   sinus rhythm.
   - started on metoprolol, uptitrate PRN as tolerated
   - monitor on telemetry
   # AML: s/p dbl cord SCT on [**5-28**]/9

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) status post 7+3 induction and double cord allo stem cell transplantation (SCT) on 5/8/9. She has cardiac and renal failure resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, with blood pressure in the high 50s. Possible causes include sepsis, over-diuresis, cardiogenic shock, or transfusion reaction. Immediate management should include continuing IV fluid resuscitation, restarting vasopressors (Neo, Levo), and obtaining blood cultures.

2. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia due to volume overload and altered mental status. Pressure support should be continued, and fluid removal by continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) should be initiated to improve respiratory status.

3. Acute systolic heart failure (CHF): The patient's LVEF has decreased from 55% to 25-30% after chemotherapy, but there is some recovery with an LVEF of 40% on echocardiography (TTE) on 6/22. Fluid removal by CVVH should be continued, and a repeat TTE should be performed.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric, and temporary"

   [**6-15**]. Fluid overload [**2-22**] acute sCHF and ARF.
   - continue mech ventilation on pressure support
   - attempting to decrease sedation and transition to haloperidol
   - check EKG daily while on haloperidol
   - volume removal by CVVH to improve respiratory status
   # ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF: likely [**2-22**] chemotherapy. LVEF 55% at baseline,
   but decreased to 25-30% w chemo, now w some recovery
 LVEF 40% on TTE
   [**6-22**].
   - continue fluid removal w CVVH
   - will need repeat TTE in future to reassess heart fxn
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: likely ATN from hypotension/poor forward flow
   (given granular casts) vs direct renal injury from chemotherapy. Pt
   anuric; temporary HD line placed [**6-15**].
   - continue fluid removal w CVVH
   - plan to switch to HD early next week
   # BACTEREMIA: VRE bacteremia seen last on [**6-14**], also h/o E. coli
   bacteremia [**6-3**]. TEE [**6-24**] negative for endocarditis. Currently
   neutropenic.
   - daptomycin for VRE, cefepime for GNR
 course to continue for 2 weeks
   after normal ANC
   - check weekly CK w daptomycin (baselin Ck = 70 on [**6-26**])
   - surveillance cxs if febrile or unstable
   - ID recs
   # PANCYTOPENIA: [**2-22**] chemotherapy. Stopped linezolid on [**6-25**] due to bone
   marrow toxicity
   - daptomycin  for VRE, cefepime for GNR
 course to continue for 2
   weeks after normal ANC
   - micafungin for fungal ppx
   - filgrastim for bone marrow stimulation
   - monitor ANC, Hct, PLTs daily
   - will transfuse platelets <20, or greater when procedures are
   contemplated;
   - transfuse Hct <24 or unstable
   - neutropenic precautions
   - BMT recs
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Unclear etiology. DDx includes bacteremia,
   sepsis, renal failure/uremia, underlying malignancy, med effect,
   delerium of the critically ill. MRI brain w/o contrast [**6-24**]
   ?mastoiditis, otherwise unremarkable.
   - LP to evaluate CSF
   - transition to antipsychotics from sedation, check daily EKG w
   haloperidol
   - consider neuro c/s if no improvement
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: paroxysmal, likely [**2-22**] stress of acute illness.
   S/p amiodarone, stopped b/c interaction w tacrolimus. Currently in
   sinus rhythm.
   - started on metoprolol, uptitrate PRN as tolerated
   - monitor on telemetry
   # AML: s/p dbl cord SCT on [**5-28**]/9
   - continue methylprednisolone
   - continue MMF (CellCept)
   - BMT recs
   # HYPONATREMIA: normal at baseline, likely [**2-22**] heart, kidney and liver
   failure w resulting hypervolemic hyponatremia
   - monitor Na daily
   - correct with CVVH
   # TRANSAMINITIS: hemolysis from CVVH vs intra hepatic/cholestatic
   process. RUQ U/S  non-diagnostic Also high tube feed residuls, concern

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a double cord allo stem cell transplantation (SCT) on 05/28/09. She is currently in the ICU due to cardiac and renal failure, resulting in hypervolemia and subsequent respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/49 mmHg to 160/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic CHF, acute renal failure, bacteremia, and pancytopenia. She also has altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, and hyponatremia. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by anuria and elevated creatinine levels. She has a history of VRE bacteremia and E. coli bacteremia. The patient's platelet count is low, and she requires platelet transfusion. She is also neutropenic.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) to manage fluid overload and improve respiratory status, hemodynamic monitoring, continuation of antibiotics for bacteremia, and administration of filgrastim to stimulate"
