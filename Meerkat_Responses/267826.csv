   Assessment and Plan
   47yo woman with hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be
   obesity hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and in afib
   with RVR so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: as above.  Her ABG on arrival
   (7.33/87/286/48) suggests that she has a primary respiratory acidosis w
   metabolic alkalosis.  She is adequately ventilated with Ve approx 10L,
   and RR of 24, but patient
s PCO2 remains high.  This indicates that
   patient is likely ventilating dead space.  With her recent aggressive
   diuresis she may be intravasularly volume depleted and have low pulm
   capillary filling pressures.  It is difficult to determine her volume
   status on exam, but she may benefit from some fluid boluses to help
   increase perfusion of dead spaces.
   - support with BiPAP as tolerated
   - can give breaks if pt unable.  Will try high flow O2 with frequent
   nebs during this time.
   - hold on further diuresis for now.
   - treat asthma with scheduled nebs and wean steroids
 steroids she is
   on Pred 40 daily
 continue for 2 more days then wean further.
   - wonder if she will need trach vs intubation if this persists  - give
   her until Monday to declare herself.
   # hypoxia: pt likely hypoxic at baseline as evidenced by her elevated
   HCT.
   - goal SaO2 88-90%
   # Afib: s/p DCCV now in sinus.
   -will d/c digoxin.
   -Continue amio at 400 [**Hospital1 **].
   - hold coumadin for now since elevated INR
 will need 1 month of
   anticoagulation after cardioversion.
   # Cards pump: EF was normal a few days ago per TEE.  Will not diurese
   further.  Suspect though an element of chronic diastolic dysfunction
   leading to pulm edema in setting of fluid overload and Afib w RVR.
   - continue rate control
   - add captopril 6.25 mg TID for afterload reduction.
   - goal i/o even.  if not, will give lasix 40 po
   - continue asa
   # Asthma: as above.  will try continuous nebs between BiPAP trials.
   Wean steroids down to pred 40 for plans of quick taper.
   # Erythrocytosis: likely chronic and indicative of underlying hypoxia.
   # Leukocytosis: suspect [**2-4**] steroids.  Can check urine cx and CXR.
   # Likely Diabetes: A1c elevated to 7.6%.  Continue ISS esp while on
   steroids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of asthma, obesity, and recent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, fluid overload, and underlying obstructive airway disease. The patient is currently on BiPAP support, which she tolerates well. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. The physical examination reveals expiratory wheezes, regular heart rhythm, and skin burns from previous cardioversion with superficial ulcerations. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but she has a history of elevated blood glucose levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged respiratory support with BiPAP, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and use of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Skin infection: The presence of burns and ulcerations on the patient's back and chest increases the risk of skin infection.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with asthma, obesity, and recent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and receiving various treatments.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 134/92 to 126/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%. Her heart rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 647-1196 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 50, bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 46 mEq/L, and oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 100.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 16.2 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 133 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose (Glucose) level of 115 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range.

The patient's chest X-ray shows a widened mediastinum, and the assessment and plan indicate that she has hypercarbic respiratory failure due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, fluid overload, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is being supported with BiPAP, high-flow oxygen, nebulizers, and aggressive diuresis is being held to bring down the bicarbonate level.

The patient also has hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, cardiac pump dysfunction, asthma, erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, suspected diabetes, anxiety, right arm neuropathy, and nothing by mouth (NPO) status. Further evaluation and management plans are outlined for each of these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening respiratory failure, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac arrhythmias, exacerbation of asthma, infections, and diabetes-related complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   47yo woman with hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be
   obesity hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and in afib
   with RVR so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: as above.  Her ABG on arrival
   (7.33/87/286/48) suggests that she has a primary respiratory acidosis w
   metabolic alkalosis.  She appears to be near baseline which I suspect
   is PaCO2 of 70s.  Part of worsening hypercarbia over last 1-2 days may
   be in setting of aggressive diuresis and elevated HCO3.
   - support with BiPAP as tolerated
   - can give breaks if pt unable.  Will try high flow O2 with frequent
   nebs during this time.
   - hold on further diuresis in hopes of bringin HCO3 back down
   - treat asthma with nebs and wean steroids
   - wonder if she will need trach vs intubation if this persists.
   - consider eval of other etiologies of failure including PE however
   consider this far less likely given underlying obesity, lack of DVT,
   and lack of tachycardia.
   # hypoxia: pt likely hypoxic at baseline as evidenced by her elevated
   HCT.
   - goal SaO2 88-90%
   # Afib: s/p DCCV now in sinus.  Will continue digoxin for now (level
   ok).  Continue amio but wean to 400 [**Hospital1 **].  Continue anticoag for at
   least one month but hold coumadin for now since elevated.
   # Cards pump: EF was normal a few days ago per TEE.  Will not diurese
   further.  Suspect though an element of chronic diastolic dysfunction
   leading to pulm edema in setting of fluid overload and Afib w RVR.
   - continue rate control
   - add captopril 6.25 mg TID.
   - goal i/o even.  if not, will give lasix 40 po
   - continue asa
   # Asthma: as above.  will try continuous nebs between BiPAP trials.
   Wean steroids down to pred 40 for plans of quick taper.
   # Erythrocytosis: likely chronic and indicative of underlying hypoxia.
   # Leukocytosis: suspect [**2-4**] steroids.  Can check urine cx and CXR.
   # Likely Diabetes: A1c elevated to 7.6%.  Continue ISS esp while on
   steroids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma, obesity, and recent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient has been tolerating BiPAP well overnight. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/92 to 126/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation between 84-92%. She is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 647 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 50, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 100, and HCO3- level of 46 mEq/L. Physical examination reveals expiratory wheezes heard diffusely in the lungs, regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2, no murmurs or gallops, and well-perfused extremities. The patient has burns on her back and anterior left chest from previous cardioversion, as well as an ecchymosis over her right shoulder from a"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female with history of obesity and chronic hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  She was admitted with atrial flutter to
   BIDH-[**Location (un) 1415**] and was cardioverted with TEE guidance.  There she also
   had continued diuresis for what may well be related to PAH and cor
   pulmonale.  Now she is transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] in the setting of continued
   difficulty management of chronic ventilatory failure/hypoxemia and
   significant volume overload.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   The open question is what is an acceptable baseline for Ms. [**Known lastname 3681**] in
   regards to her ventilation.  She has chronic respiratory failure
   secondary to her obesity and likely co-existing intermittent
   hypercarbia during the night with OSA will contribute to resetting of
   her metabolic picture to be one of chronic ventilatory failure and
   metabolic compensation and with intermittent insult of atrial
   tachycardia certainly volume overload  may have been contributing to
   significant worsening around the time of admission.
   As far as management for this
she will need weight loss and should be
   considered for surgical management
and in the interim she will need
   more stable management of her ventilatory compromise.  The increased
   Vd/Vt is likely driving the inadequate ventilation at this point
   (Ve=[**12-17**] but PCO2=89)
and this may well be attributable to residual
   airways obstruction and relative hypovolemia.
   For
Asthma
   Pred 40mg
   Nebs to go q 2 hours for this morning
   For likely Hypovolemia-
   Hold Lasix for now and some volume replacement
   For Hypoxemia-
   This may be chronic issue and the concern is for some ongoing
   minimization of alveolar gas with hypercarbia
no atrial septal defect
   suggested on TEE
   Will need optimization of above to allow time off BIPAP mask and will
   certainly need home treatment
   Will need to consider tracheostomy in light of how patient responds to
   current management and this is of concern as it is not clear that acute
   insult clearly severely exacerbated her chronic ventilatory failure.
   Atrial Fibrillation-

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of obesity and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was admitted to BIDH with atrial flutter and underwent cardioversion using TEE guidance. She also received diuresis for what may be related to PAH and cor pulmonale. Now she is transferred to Hospital 154 due to continued difficulty in managing chronic ventilatory failure/hypoxemia and significant volume overload.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by obesity, which likely contributes to her chronic respiratory failure. She also has intermittent hypercarbia during the night, which may contribute to resetting her metabolic picture towards chronic ventilatory failure and metabolic compensation. Additionally, the patient has had an atrial tachycardia, which may have exacerbated her volume overload around the time of admission.

The patient requires weight loss and consideration for surgical management. In the interim, she needs more stable management of her ventilatory compromise. An increased Vd/Vt ratio is likely driving the inadequate ventilation, and this may be attributable to residual airways obstruction and relative hypovolemia.

For asthma, the patient will be given prednisone 40mg and nebulized treatments every 2 hours. For likely hypovolemia, Lasix will be held, and volume replacement will be performed. For hypoxemia, optimization of the above treatments will be necessary to allow time off the BIPAP mask, and home treatment will be considered. A tracheostomy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma, obesity, and obstructive airway disease. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, fluid overload, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and underlying obstructive airway disease. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. Her oxygenation is also compromised, as indicated by low PaO2 levels. She has experienced bleeding from various sites, including the Foley catheter, nasal mucosa, and arterial line. Other complications include neuropathy in the right arm, likely due to peripheral nerve damage from a PICC line placement. The patient's elevated hematocrit suggests chronic hypoxia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is likely hypoxic at baseline, as evidenced by her elevated hematocrit. The goal SaO2 is 88-90%.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results indicate a primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. This suggests inadequate ventilation and carbon dioxide retention.
3. Bleeding: The patient has experienced bleeding from multiple sites, including the Foley catheter, nasal mucosa, and arterial line. This could be due to the elevated INR caused by amiodarone and potential volume depletion.
4. Right Arm Neuropathy: The patient has developed sensory"

   47 yo obesie F w/  chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
   failure.
   Admitted to OSH with atrial flutter now s/p cardioversion with TEE
   guidance.  There she also had continued diuresis for what may well be
   related to PAH and cor pulmonale.  Now she is transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] in
   the setting of continued difficulty management of chronic ventilatory
   failure/hypoxemia and significant volume overload.
    # Respiratory Failure-hypercarbic/hypoxic
   # Asthma
   She has chronic respiratory failure secondary to her obesity and likely
   co-existing intermittent hypercarbia during the night with OSA will
   contribute to resetting of her metabolic picture to be one of chronic
   ventilatory failure and metabolic compensation and with intermittent
   insult of atrial tachycardia certainly volume overload  may have been
   contributing to significant worsening around the time of admission.
   --Abgs are improving with aim to presumed baseline CO2 levels (liekly
   in 70 torr range)
   BiPAP intermittenly and overnight / high flow shovel mask
   Follow abgs
   Reassess for need for trach
   Would benefit from BIPAP at home for chronic use
   Consider surgical wgt loss
   As far as management for this
she will need weight loss and should be
   considered for surgical management
and in the interim she will need
   more stable management of her ventilatory compromise.  The increased
   Vd/Vt is likely driving the inadequate ventilation at this point
   (Ve=[**12-17**] but PCO2=89)
and this may well be attributable to residual
   airways obstruction and relative hypovolemia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old obese female with chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU due to difficulty in managing her chronic ventilatory failure and hypoxemia, as well as significant volume overload. 

The patient's medical history includes chronic respiratory failure secondary to obesity and likely co-existing intermittent hypercarbia during the night with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which contributes to resetting her metabolic picture to one of chronic ventilatory failure and metabolic compensation. She also has intermittent atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter, which have been cardioverted back to sinus rhythm.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, asthma, coagulopathy from medication interactions/coumadin, hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, anxiety, hyperglycemia, peripheral nerve pain/numbness, and constipation.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory Failure-hypercarbic/hypoxic: The patient needs continued management of chronic ventilatory failure/hypoxemia and significant volume overload. She will be placed on BiPAP intermittently and overnight with a high flow nasal cannula mask. ABGs should be followed, and reassessment for the need for tracheostomy should be done. She would benefit from BiPAP at home for chronic use and consideration for surgical weight loss.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, asthma, coagulopathy from medication interactions/coumadin, hypovolemic after aggressive diuresis, atrial fibrillation, anxiety, hyperglycemia, peripheral nerve pain/numbness, and constipation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of asthma, bleeding due to coagulopathy, electrolyte imbalances, infection from the use of invasive lines, and complications related to the patient's obesity such as pressure ulcers or deep vein thrombosis.

It is also important to monitor the patient's glycemic control, as she is at risk for hyperglycemia exacerbated by steroids. Additionally, the patient's peripheral nerve pain/numbness should be further assessed, possibly with an EMG.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions and potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma and morbid obesity presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is also experiencing bleeding from multiple sites, including the Foley catheter, nasal mucosa, and face tent. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 88%, indicating hypoxia. The patient's heart rhythm has been converted from atrial fibrillation (afib) to sinus rhythm after a synchronized cardioversion. She has an elevated hematocrit (HCT) level, suggesting polycythemia.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's ABG indicates primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. She is being ventilated with a rate of 24 breaths per minute and tidal volume of approximately 10 liters. However, her end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) remains high, suggesting that she is likely ventilating dead space. The patient may benefit from fluid boluses to improve perfusion of dead spaces. Support with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) will be provided as tolerated. Recheck ABG in the afternoon and consider giving more fluids then. The goal is to maintain a PCO2 level in the 70s.

2. Hypoxia: The patient likely has chronic hypoxia as evidenced by her elevated H"

1. Hemorrhage/Hematoma: The patient has increased bleeding at the site of arterial line (A-line) sutures, which is not responsive to surgical sealant. Her INR is 1.3, indicating a slightly elevated bleeding risk.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient is hypoxic with a SpO2 of 88%. This may be due to her underlying obstructive airway disease and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The goal is to maintain her SaO2 between 88-90%.

3. Asthma: The patient's asthma is hindering ventilation. She is being treated with scheduled nebs (nebulized bronchodilators) and steroids. The plan is to wean steroids down to prednisone 40 mg daily for quick taper.

4. Anemia: The patient is experiencing acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage). Her Hct has dropped from 56% to 47% due to oozing blood loss from various sites. Further evaluation and management are required.

   hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and in afib with RVR
   so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: as above.  Her ABG on arrival
   (7.33/87/286/48) suggests that she has a primary respiratory acidosis w
   metabolic alkalosis.  She is adequately ventilated with Ve approx 10L,
   and RR of 24, but patient
s PCO2 remains high.  This indicates that
   patient is likely ventilating dead space.  With her recent aggressive
   diuresis she may be intravasularly volume depleted and have low pulm
   capillary filling pressures.  Patient
s ABG improved significantly with
   1 L of fluid.  She may continue to may benefit from some fluid boluses
   to help increase perfusion of dead spaces.
   - support with BiPAP as tolerated
 use BIPAP at night
   - can give breaks if pt unable.  Will try high flow O2 with frequent
   nebs during this time.
   - recheck ABG in afternoon and consider giving more fluids then.  GOAL

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma and morbid obesity. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, along with fluid overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Her initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showed primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. The patient has been receiving noninvasive ventilation but still has elevated carbon dioxide levels, indicating ventilation of dead space. She has received fluid boluses to improve perfusion of dead spaces and is being supported with BiPAP as tolerated. Further management includes treating asthma with scheduled nebulizers and weaning steroids, considering tracheostomy versus intubation if respiratory failure persists, and referring the patient for bariatric surgery. Other concerns include hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, bleeding from various sites, cardiac dysfunction, right arm neuropathy, leukocytosis, suspected diabetes, anxiety, and skin care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not adequately ventilate or if there is further progression of her underlying conditions.
2. Bleeding: The patient has ongoing bleeding from multiple sites, including the a-line suture site, Foley catheter, and nasal mucosa. This could lead to significant blood loss and anemia.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate hypoxemia, which can compromise tissue oxygen"

She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing increased bleeding from an arterial line site. Her ABG shows a primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. The patient's PCO2 remains high despite adequate ventilation, indicating ventilation of dead space. She may benefit from fluid boluses to increase perfusion of dead spaces. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is likely hypoxic at baseline, as evidenced by her elevated hematocrit (HCT).
2. Atrial fibrillation (afib): The patient was in afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and has been cardioverted back to sinus rhythm.
3. Bleeding: Although the bleeding from the arterial line site has been addressed, continuous monitoring is necessary to prevent further bleeding.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient may have chronic diastolic dysfunction leading to pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload and afib with RVR.
5. Neurological issues: The patient has right arm neuropathy, possibly due to peripheral nerve damage from a PICC line. Sensory loss in the median nerve distribution is present, but it is slowly improving.
6. Asthma exacerbation: The patient has asthma, which may worsen during her stay in the ICU.
7. Erythrocytosis: The"

","The patient is a 47-year-old obese female with chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. She was admitted initially for atrial flutter, which was successfully cardioverted with transesophageal echocardiography guidance. She then experienced difficulty in managing chronic ventilatory failure/hypoxemia and was transferred to another hospital.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory Failure-hypercarbic/hypoxic: Suspected chronic respiratory failure secondary to obesity and co-existing intermittent hypercarbia during the night with probable severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Intermittent insult of atrial tachycardia with volume overload likely contributed to significant worsening around the time of admission. ABG worsening but did not use BiPAP overnight. BiPAP now and intermittently during the day to correct CO2 towards presumed baseline. Follow ABGs and initiate discussions with the patient regarding the importance of BiPAP at home for chronic use, and reassess potential need for tracheostomy over the next 2-3 days.
- Asthma: Continue prednisone taper, nebs, and Advair.
- Coagulopathy from med interactions/coumadin: INR normalized with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Ultimately, anticoagulate post-cardioversion for one month, consider hepatic GGT.
- Hypovolemic after aggressive diuresis: Hold Lasix for now and allow reequilibration"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old obese female with chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. She was initially admitted to OSH with atrial flutter, which was successfully cardioverted. She was then transferred to [Hospital1] due to continued difficulty in managing chronic ventilatory failure and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient's chronic respiratory failure is secondary to obesity and co-existing intermittent hypercarbia during the night with probable severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and resetting of her metabolic picture to be one of chronic ventilatory failure and metabolic compensation. Intermittent insults of atrial tachycardia with volume overload likely contributed to the significant worsening around the time of admission.
2. Asthma - The patient has a history of asthma, which will be managed with prednisone taper, nebs, and Advair.
3. Coagulopathy - The patient experienced significant oozing at the arterial line site, likely due to medication interactions/coumadin. The INR normalized with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
4. Hypovolemic - After aggressive diuresis, the patient developed hypovolemia, and Lasix was held to allow for equilibration with PO intake.
5. Atrial Fibrillation - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she is being continued on amiodarone.

   Assessment and Plan
   47yo woman with h/o of asthma and morbid obesisty who presents with
   hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be obesity
   hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and in afib with RVR
   so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: as above.  Her ABG on arrival
   (7.33/87/286/48) suggests that she has a primary respiratory acidosis w
   metabolic alkalosis.  She was adequately ventilated with Ve approx 10L,
   and RR of 24, but patient
s PCO2 was high.  This indicates that patient
   is likely ventilating dead space.  With her recent aggressive diuresis
   she may be intravasularly volume depleted and have low pulm capillary
   filling pressures.  Patient
s ABG initially improved significantly with
   1 L of fluid.  However yesterday she did not respond to IVF boluses.
   - Limited response to fluids yesterday am.  Will try to keep her
   neutral for today---hold boluses and diuresis for now.
   - support with BiPAP as tolerated
 use BIPAP at night
   - Attempt to use continuously at night;  can give breaks during the day
   if pt unable.   Use high flow O2 with frequent nebs during this time.
   - treat asthma with scheduled nebs and wean steroids
 steroids she is
   on Pred 30 daily
 continue for 1 more day then wean further.
   - may need trach vs intubation if patient does not respond to BiPAP
   - outpatient referral for bariatric surgery.
   - patient qualifies for BIPAP at home and may benefit significantly
   from this.
   # hypoxia: pt likely hypoxic at baseline as evidenced by her elevated
   HCT.
   - goal SaO2 88-90%
   # Afib: s/p DCCV; pt was in sinus until this am when converted back to
   a-fib
   - Continue amio at 400 [**Hospital1 **].
   - Start diltiazem drip; if responsive begin po dilt and wean off the
   drip
   - Start coumadin today. INR 1.2.  Will not bridge with heparin.
   - can continue SQH
   # Bleeding
 no active bleeding at this time; will continue to monitor
   foley, mucus membranes and lines.  INR 1.2 this am.
   -  no need for transfusion (blood, plasma, or platelets) at this time
   - monitor Hct, plts, INR daily
   # Cards pump: EF was normal a few days ago per TEE.  Will not diurese
   further.  Suspect though an element of chronic diastolic dysfunction
   leading to pulm edema in setting of fluid overload and Afib w RVR.
   - continue rate control
   - continue captopril 6.25 mg TID for afterload reduction.
   - goal i/o even.
   - continue asa
   # Neuro: right arm neuropathy thought ? [**2-4**] periph nerve damage in
   setting of PICC.  Sensory loss in median nerve distribution.
   Pt states it is slowly improving.
   -- obtain OT consult for use of right hand if it progresses
   # Asthma: as above.  Continue scheduled nebs.  will try continuous nebs
   between BiPAP trials.  Wean steroids down to pred 30 for plans of quick
   taper.
   # Leukocytosis: suspect [**2-4**] steroids.  Declining.   No signs or
   symptoms of infection
   # Likely Diabetes: A1c elevated to 7.6%.  Continue ISS esp while on
   steroids.
   # anxiety: continue w ativan prn
   # Neuro: right arm neuropathy thought ? [**2-4**] periph nerve damage in
   setting of PICC.
   # FEN: advance diet to regular as tolerated.
   #skin:  routine wound care for burns.  Miconazole powder to be applied
   to groin area.
   # access: PIV x1.  A-line
 use arm board for a-line for now.
   -Obtain 2nd PIV.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma and morbid obesity who presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been experiencing difficulty in ventilating and has a high PCO2 level despite adequate ventilation. The patient's ABG results indicate primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the initiation of non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) support, administration of Diltiazem for a rapid ventricular response, and treatment for asthma with scheduled nebs and weaning steroids. She is also being monitored for hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, bleeding, cardiac issues, neuropathy, potential diabetes, anxiety, and skin concerns.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 109/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her current medications include pantoprazole, codeine, and amiodarone.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of atrial fibrillation, development of deep vein thrombosis or stress ulcers due to prolonged immobilization, and potential infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, cardiac rhythm, and overall clinical condition is essential to prevent and manage"

   47yo woman with h/o of asthma and morbid obesisty who presents with
   hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be obesity
   hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and in afib with RVR
   so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: as above.  Her ABG on arrival
   (7.33/87/286/48) suggests that she has a primary respiratory acidosis w
   metabolic alkalosis.  She is adequately ventilated with Ve approx 10L,
   and RR of 24, but patient
s PCO2 remains high.  This indicates that
   patient is likely ventilating dead space.  With her recent aggressive
   diuresis she may be intravasularly volume depleted and have low pulm
   capillary filling pressures.  Patient
s ABG improved significantly with
   1 L of fluid.  She may continue to may benefit from some fluid boluses
   to help increase perfusion of dead spaces.
   - support with BiPAP as tolerated
 use BIPAP at night
   - Attempt to use continuously at night;  can give breaks during the day
   if pt unable.   Use high flow O2 with frequent nebs during this time.
   - Limited response to fluids yesterday am.  Will try to keep her
   neutral for the rest of the day.  Will hold boluses and diuresis for
   now.
   - treat asthma with scheduled nebs and wean steroids

   - may need trach vs intubation if patient does not respond to BiPAP or
   refuses it.
   - outpatient referral for bariatric surgery.
   - patient qualifies for BIPAP at home and may benefit significantly
   from this.

   HCT.
   - goal SaO2 88-90%
   # Afib: s/p DCCV now in sinus.
   - Continue amio at 400 [**Hospital1 **].

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma, morbid obesity, and underlying obstructive airway disease. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be due to obesity hypoventilation, fluid overload, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w RVR). Her initial arterial blood gas (ABG) showed primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.

The patient is currently on intermittent BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) throughout the day and constant BiPAP at night. Her ABG has not shown significant improvement. She is also receiving high-flow oxygen and frequent nebs (nebulizer treatments) during this time.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 109/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her physical examination reveals diffuse mild wheezing on expiration and coarse breath sounds throughout the left side more than the right side.

Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR), but platelet count is normal.

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female with history of obesity and now admitted with acute on
   chronic respiratory failure after initial presenation with tachycardia.
   Chronic Respiratory Failure with Acute Exacerbation-
   -BIPAP as tolerated
   -Advair
reasonable and much of the expiratory airflow obstruction is
   quite likely related to low lung volumes
   -Albuterol to be held at this time
   -Will certainly need nocturnal BIPAP support and intermittently across
   the day.  She may have a need for better metabolic state to allow
   persistent chronic respiratory failure with compensation.
   -Will likely need trach to allow reasonable/safe support for
   ventilatory status.
   Tachycardia-Had A-fib at OSH--here she had concern for AVNRT or
   A-Flutter
now with intermittent findings of atrial fibrillation
   suggests that we have A-flutter/A-fib persisting
   -Amiodarone continuing
400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Dilt as needed for symptomatic tachycardia and move to Dilt gtt this
   am.
   -Will Rx as A-Fib with rate control and consideration of
   anticoagulation and favor return for the long term with anticoagulation
   given A-Fib and DVT risk
   Obesity
   Morbid obesity
   Will need consideration of bariatric surgery to allow intervention and
   correction
   Median Nerve Injury
will need consideration of EMG for follow up, has
   shown improvement over time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of obesity, admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic respiratory failure. She presented with tachycardia and was initially supported with BIPAP. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 111/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. She is on high-flow oxygen and CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 78 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 108, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient has been diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure with an acute exacerbation, likely related to low lung volumes. She is also experiencing tachycardia, likely due to AVNRT or atrial flutter/fibrillation. Other medical conditions include morbid obesity, and a history of median nerve injury. The patient will require further management, including nocturnal BIPAP support, tracheostomy, and consideration for bariatric surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to chronic respiratory failure, the patient is at risk for worsening respiratory acidosis, pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and barotrauma from prolonged ventilation support.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma and morbid obesity who presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and obstructive airway disease. The patient is receiving various treatments, including diltiazem, digoxin, and warfarin for her cardiac condition. She is also being treated for asthma with nebulizers and steroids. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing muscle skeletal complaints due to prolonged bed rest. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates difficulty in adequately ventilating and removing carbon dioxide from the lungs. If not managed properly, this can lead to further respiratory failure and potential complications such as hypoxemia and acidosis.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is likely hypoxic at baseline, and her elevated hematocrit (HCT) suggests this. Atelectasis may also contribute to her hypoxia. Improving oxygenation and addressing any underlying causes will be crucial to prevent further hypoxic episodes.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) needs to be closely monitored, as uncontrolled AF can lead to cardiovascular complications such as stroke or heart failure. The use of amiodarone and digoxin aims to control her heart rate and rhythm.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged bed rest and immobility increase the risk of DVT. Prophylaxis measures, such as heparin, are in place to prevent clot formation.
5. Infection: Leukocytosis indicates an elevated white blood cell count, which can be a sign of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy if needed is important.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's right arm neuropathy requires evaluation by Neurology to determine the cause and appropriate management.
7. Pressure injuries: Prolonged bed rest increases the risk of developing pressure injuries. Regular repositioning and appropriate wound care are essential to prevent these complications.
8. Diabetes: The patient's elevated A1c suggests diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. Monitoring and managing blood glucose levels will be important during her ICU stay.

Overall, the patient's care in the ICU requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic conditions. Early identification and intervention for potential complications will be crucial for her recovery."

   # Hypercarbic resp failure: as above.  Her ABG on arrival
   (7.33/87/286/48) suggests that she has a primary respiratory acidosis w
   metabolic alkalosis.  She was adequately ventilated with Ve approx 10L,
   and RR of 24, but patient
s PCO2 was high.  This indicates that patient
   is likely ventilating dead space.  With her recent aggressive diuresis
   she may be intravasularly volume depleted and have low pulm capillary
   filling pressures.  Patient
s ABG initially improved significantly with
   1 L of fluid.  However yesterday she did not respond to IVF boluses.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma, morbid obesity, and obstructive airway disease. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient also has fluid overload, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR), and evidence of pulmonary edema.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), a heart rate of 81 bpm (with a range of 73-146 bpm), a blood pressure of 129/78 mmHg (with a range of 80-133/41-83 mmHg), a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (with a range of 11-26 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels are within normal limits. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's plan includes treating her hypercarbic respiratory failure with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) using BiPAP. She will continue to receive scheduled nebulizers (nebs) and steroids, which will be weaned"

   Assessment and Plan
   47yo woman with h/o of asthma and morbid obesisty who presents with
   hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be obesity
   hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and in afib with RVR
   so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: as above.  Her ABG on arrival
   (7.33/87/286/48) suggests that she has a primary respiratory acidosis w
   metabolic alkalosis.  She was adequately ventilated with Ve approx 10L,
   and RR of 24, but patient
s PCO2 was high.  This indicates that patient
   is likely ventilating dead space.  With her recent aggressive diuresis
   she may be intravasularly volume depleted and have low pulm capillary
   filling pressures.  Patient
s ABG initially improved significantly with
   1 L of fluid.  However yesterday she did not respond to IVF boluses.
   - Limited response to fluids yesterday am.  Will try to keep her
   neutral for today---hold boluses and diuresis for now.
   - Attempt to use continuously at night;  can give breaks during the day
   if pt unable.   Use high flow O2 with frequent nebs during this time.
   - treat asthma with scheduled nebs and wean steroids
 steroids she is
   on Pred 30 daily
 continue for 1 more day then wean further.
   - may need trach vs intubation if patient does not respond to BiPAP
   - outpatient referral for bariatric surgery.
   - patient qualifies for BIPAP at home and may benefit significantly
   from this.

   - Continue amio at 400 [**Hospital1 **].
   - Start diltiazem drip; if responsive begin po dilt and wean off the

- The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma and morbid obesity.
- She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, fluid overload, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and underlying obstructive airway disease.
- The patient's initial arterial blood gas (ABG) on arrival showed primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.
- She was adequately ventilated, but her PCO2 was high, indicating ventilation of dead space.
- The patient has had limited response to intravenous fluid boluses.
- The plan includes keeping her neutral for the day, holding boluses and diuresis, using high flow oxygen with frequent nebulizers, and attempting to wean off steroids.
- She may need a tracheostomy versus intubation if she does not respond to BiPAP.
- An outpatient referral for bariatric surgery is recommended.
- The patient may benefit from a home BiPAP machine.
- She has hypoxia, likely at baseline, with an elevated hematocrit (HCT).
- The goal is to maintain a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) between 88-90%.
- The patient was in sinus rhythm until this morning when she converted back to atrial fibrillation (afib).
- Continue amiodarone at 400 mg and start diltiazem drip. If responsive, begin oral d"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma and morbid obesity who presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which may have contributed to her condition. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and fluid overload, as evidenced by her elevated blood pressure and weight.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 129/78 to 133/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's weight is currently 217.3 kg, indicating a significant amount of excess weight.

The patient is receiving diltiazem drip at a rate of 10 mg/hour and is also on other medications including Coumadin (warfarin) and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Her allergies include penicillins, codeine, and unknown allergies.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 64 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 134, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 67, and base excess of -9. These values indicate a primary respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo female with obesity and significant hypoventilation and
   hypoxemia.  She has had a minimum of dynamic airflow obstruction.
   Respiratory Failure-
   Chronic Obstruction--This is existing diagnosis--are weaning Prednisone
   and contining Advair with reasonably minimal risk in the setting of
   acute illness although obstruction is likley related to low lung
   volumes primarily.  The consolidation and shunt is quite likely the
   primary driver of the hypoxemia given testing and evaluation to date.
   She will need
   -[**Hospital1 **]-Level Support with EEP in the range of 10-15cm H2O.  This should be
   well tolerated in this relatively euvolemic state
   -Will need to match her intrapleural pressure which is quite likely
   elevated significantly
   -Goal [**Hospital1 **]-Level support is 20/12 by the end of the day with good
   tolerance
   -She has to get out of bed to obtain mechanical advantage to facilitate
   recruitment of lung units
   Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Digoxin
   -Diltiazem gtt continuing at 15
   -Will need anticoagulation and rate control as management
   -Trial of beta blocker if needed as primary intevention for rate
   control as primary bronchospasm is likely less of a concern given
   obsity and restriction likely driving the wheezing
   Nerve Injury-
   -Has worsening pain and discomfort
   -Neurology consultation to evaluate and consider studies.
   -Question is management and diagnosis of ulnar nerve injury in setting
   of PICC line placement

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with obesity and significant hypoventilation and hypoxemia. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 133/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She is on high flow nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and has been placed on standby ventilator mode with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 134.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure - Chronic Obstruction: The patient will need to continue using Advair and wean off Prednisone with minimal risk. She will require hospital-level support with EEP in the range of 10-15 cmH2O, matching her intrapleural pressure, and aiming for a goal of 20/12 by the end of the day with good tolerance.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on digoxin and Diltiazem gtt. She needs anticoagulation and rate control as management. A trial of beta blocker can be considered for rate control.

   Assessment and Plan
   47yo woman with h/o of asthma and morbid obesity who presents with
   hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be obesity
   hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and in afib with RVR
   so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure:
   - Attempt to use continuously at night;  can give breaks during the day
   if pt unable.   Use high flow O2 with frequent nebs during this time.
   - treat asthma with scheduled nebs and wean steroids
 steroids she is
   on Pred 30 daily
 continue for 1 more day then wean further.
   - may need trach vs intubation if patient does not respond to BiPAP
   - outpatient referral for bariatric surgery.
   - patient qualifies for BIPAP at home and may benefit significantly
   from this.
   # hypoxia: pt likely hypoxic at baseline as evidenced by her elevated
   HCT,  hypoxia likely increased by atelectasis
   - get patient to sit up in chair; increase PEEP
   - goal SaO2 88-90%
   # Afib: s/p DCCV; pt was in sinus until this am when converted back to
   a-fib
   - Continue amio at 400 [**Hospital1 **].
   - Continue digoxin 0.125 (check level on Thursday [**7-27**])
   - Continue diltiazem drip; if responsive begin po dilt and wean off the
   drip
   - Start coumadin today. INR 1.2.  Will not bridge with heparin.
   - can continue SQH
   # Bleeding
 no active bleeding at this time; will continue to monitor
   foley, mucus membranes and lines.  INR 1.2 this am.
   -  no need for transfusion (blood, plasma, or platelets) at this time
   - monitor Hct, plts, INR daily
   # Cards pump: EF was normal a few days ago per TEE.  Will not diurese
   further.  Suspect though an element of chronic diastolic dysfunction
   leading to pulm edema in setting of fluid overload and Afib w RVR.
   - continue rate control
   - continue captopril 6.25 mg TID for afterload reduction.
   - goal i/o even.
   - continue asa
   # Neuro: right arm neuropathy thought ? [**2-4**] periph nerve damage in
   setting of PICC.  Sensory loss in median nerve distribution.
   Pt states it is worse this morning.
   --consult Neurology
   # Asthma: as above.  Continue scheduled nebs.  will try continuous nebs
   between BiPAP trials.  Wean steroids down to pred 30 for plans of quick
   taper.
    # Leukocytosis: suspect [**2-4**] steroids.  Declining.   No signs or
   symptoms of infection
   # Likely Diabetes: A1c elevated to 7.6%.  Continue ISS esp while on

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma, morbid obesity, and underlying obstructive airway disease. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, fluid overload, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and obstructive airway disease. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/58 mmHg to 145/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She is on noninvasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, using an aerosol-cool device. The ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 56 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 128, and HCO3- level of 36 mEq/L. 

The patient has decreased breath sounds at the posterior bases of the lungs bilaterally, mild wheezing, and persistent bleeding from the subcutaneous heparin injection site. She also has mild weakness in her right hand grip, increased numbness, and discomfort in her right hand. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 160 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 13"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma and morbid obesity presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She also has underlying obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is characterized by high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood due to inadequate ventilation. If not managed properly, this can lead to respiratory acidosis and further respiratory complications.

2. Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome: The patient's obesity may contribute to hypoventilation, where the lungs do not adequately exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. This can worsen the respiratory failure and increase the risk of other complications such as pulmonary hypertension and sleep apnea.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient appears to be fluid overloaded, which can put additional strain on the heart and lungs. If not addressed, it may lead to pulmonary edema and cardiac complications.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib w/ RVR): The patient has been diagnosed with AFib, a type of abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating. If left untreated or uncontrolled, AFib w/ RVR can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications.

5. Hypoxia: The patient is likely hypoxic at baseline, as evidenced by her elevated hematocrit (HCT)"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma and morbid obesity. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and appears to have obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She was found to be fluid overloaded and in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient also has underlying obstructive airway disease.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoventilation, which has improved symptomatically with an upright position and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). BiPAP will be used continuously at night, with breaks during the day if necessary. High flow oxygen with frequent nebulizations will be provided. The diagnosis of asthma is questionable, so scheduled nebulizers with xopenex will continue, and steroids will be weaned to 10 mg daily for 2 days. If there is no response to BiPAP, tracheostomy or intubation may be considered. The patient qualifies for BiPAP at home and may benefit significantly from it.
2. Hypoxia: The patient likely has chronic hypoxia, possibly due to atelectasis. She should sit up in a chair and increase PEEP to improve oxygenation. The goal for arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is 88-90%.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced a defibrillation (DCCV) after being in sinus rhythm"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with chronic ventilatory failure who is currently in the ICU. She is being treated for respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, right heart failure, and a possible hematoma. The patient has shown some improvement in her condition, including a decrease in Pco2 levels and an improvement in oxygenation. She is currently on BiPAP support and will be weaned off prednisone over the next two days. The goal is to ambulate the patient if her heart rate remains stable. Nebulizers will be used as needed. The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable, but there are concerns about right heart failure. She also has a median nerve injury, for which a CT scan will be done to follow up. Pain control will be managed with Neurontin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying condition is chronic ventilatory failure, which can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events if not managed appropriately.
3. Right heart failure: The patient has signs of right heart failure, which can worsen her respiratory status and overall prognosis if not addressed.
4. Hematoma: There is a concern for a hematoma, which could lead to further bleeding complications and potential airway compromise.
5. Median nerve injury: The patient"

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma, morbid obesity, and underlying obstructive airway disease. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient also had evidence of fluid overload and right ventricular failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoventilation has improved symptomatically with an upright position and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Continuous use of bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) at night is recommended, with breaks during the day if necessary. High-flow oxygen and frequent nebulizer treatments will be provided during this time.
2. Asthma: The diagnosis of asthma is questionable, so scheduled nebulizer treatments with xopenex (due to tachy on albuterol) and gradual weaning of steroids to 10 mg daily for 2 days will be continued.
3. Hypoxia: The patient likely had baseline hypoxia as evidenced by her elevated hematocrit (HCT), and hypoxia was further increased by atelectasis. The patient should sit up in a chair, increase PEEP, and aim for a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) between 88-90%.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma, morbid obesity, and underlying obstructive airway disease. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be due to obesity hypoventilation. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, fluid overload, and right ventricular failure. The patient's condition is improving with the use of BiPAP, increased PEEP, and high flow oxygen. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypoventilation has led to an accumulation of carbon dioxide in her bloodstream, causing respiratory failure. Continued use of BiPAP and high flow oxygen will help improve her ventilation.
2. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: The patient's morbid obesity may contribute to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Weight loss through bariatric surgery is recommended for long-term management.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's irregular heartbeat increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. Medications such as amiodarone, digoxin, and metoprolol will be used to control her heart rate.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, indicating fluid overload. Diuretics and careful monitoring of fluid intake and output will be necessary to manage this condition.
5. Right ventricular failure: The patient's right ventricular function is compromised,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma and morbid obesity who presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which may have contributed to her condition. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to her elevated hematocrit level.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, pantoprazole (Protonix), and codeine. She has allergies to penicillins and unknown medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed no abnormalities in her peripheral vascular system, skin, or neurologic status. Her lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, total bilirubin, and lactic acid, as well as low levels of potassium and bicarbonate.

Imaging studies include a CT scan of her upper extremities and a chest X-ray. The patient's urine culture was contaminated, and she tested negative for Clostridium difficile.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for hypercarbic respiratory failure, asthma, anemia secondary to blood loss"

   Assessment & Plan:
   47yo woman with h/o questionable asthma and morbid obesity who presents
   with hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be obesity
   hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and in afib with RVR
   so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure:  hypoventilation; symptomatically improved
   with upright position and increased PEEP
   - Attempt to use BiPAP continuously at night; can give breaks during
   the day if pt unable.   Use high flow O2 with frequent nebs during this
   time.
   - diagnosis of asthma is questionable; continue with scheduled nebs
   (xopenex due to tachy on albuterol) and wean steroids
 to 10mg daily x
   2 days
   - may need trach vs intubation if patient does not respond to BiPAP
   - outpatient referral for bariatric surgery.
   - patient qualifies for BIPAP at home and may benefit significantly
   from this.
   # hypoxia: pt likely hypoxic at baseline as evidenced by her elevated
   HCT,  hypoxia likely increased by atelectasis;
   - patient to sit up in chair; increase PEEP
   - goal SaO2 88-90%
   # Afib: s/p DCCV; pt was in sinus until [**2130-7-24**] when converted back to
   a-fib
   - Continue amio at 400 [**Hospital1 **].
   - Continue digoxin 0.125 (check level on Thursday [**7-27**])
   - Pt minimally responsive to diltiazem; will switch to metoprolol
   37.5mg po TID and titrate for rate control
   - Continue coumadin INR 1.2.  Will start bridge with heparin
no loading
   dose.
   - can d/c SQH
   # Bleeding
 no active bleeding at this time; will continue to monitor
   foley, mucus membranes and lines.  INR 1.2 this am.
   -  no need for transfusion (blood, plasma, or platelets) at this time
   - monitor Hct, plts, INR daily
   # Cards pump: EF was normal a few days ago per TEE.  Will not diurese
   further.  Suspect though an element of chronic diastolic dysfunction
   leading to pulm edema in setting of fluid overload and Afib w RVR.
   - rate control with metoprolol
   - continue captopril 12.5 mg TID for afterload reduction.
   - goal i/o : negative but is autodiuresing; will not start lasix

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma and morbid obesity who presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, fluid overloaded, and had smaller lung volumes with hazier appearance in the left lower lobe, suggestive of atelectasis rather than infiltrate.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient appears to have hypoventilation, which may be due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. This could have been exacerbated by fluid overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's symptoms improved with an upright position and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). 
- Continue BiPAP therapy continuously at night and give breaks during the day if the patient is unable.
- Use high-flow oxygen with frequent nebulizers during this time.
- Wean steroids to 10 mg daily for 2 days.
- Consider tracheostomy versus intubation if the patient does not respond to BiPAP.
- Refer the patient for bariatric surgery as an outpatient.
- The patient qualifies for BiPAP at home and may benefit significantly from this.

2. Hypoxia: The patient likely had chronic hypoxia as evidenced by her elevated hematocrit (HCT). Hypoxia may have been worsened by atelectasis.
- Encourage the patient to sit up in a chair.

   47yo woman with h/o questionable asthma and morbid obesity who presents
   with hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be obesity
   hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and in afib with RVR
   so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure:  hypoventilation; symptomatically improved
   with upright position and increased PEEP
   - Attempt to use BiPAP continuously at night; can give breaks during
   the day if pt unable.   Will optimize BIPAP settings tonight and get an
   AM ABG in order to rec settings to outside hospital.
   - diagnosis of asthma is questionable; switch nebs to PRN (xopenex due
   to tachy on albuterol & ipatropiium)  and wean steroids to 10mg daily x
   1 more day then off.
   - outpatient referral for bariatric surgery.
   - patient qualifies for BIPAP at home and may benefit significantly
   from this.
   - work with PT today get OOB and ambulate and monitor resp status while
   ambulating.
   # hypoxia: pt likely hypoxic at baseline as evidenced by her elevated
   HCT,  hypoxia likely increased by atelectasis;
   - patient to sit up in chair; increase PEEP
   - goal SaO2 88-90%
   # Afib: s/p DCCV; pt was in sinus until [**2130-7-24**] when converted back to
   a-fib
   - Continue amio at 400 [**Hospital1 **] and change to 400mg PO daily tomorrow.
   - Continue digoxin 0.125 (check level on Thursday [**7-27**])
   - Pt minimally responsive to diltiazem; will switch to metoprolol
   37.5mg po TID and titrate for rate control
   - Continue coumadin ([**7-24**] restarted, increased dose to 10mg yesterday)
    -- INR 1.2.  Continue heparin gtt.  Monitor coags.
   # Bleeding
 no active bleeding at this time; will continue to monitor
   foley, mucus membranes and lines.  INR 1.2 this am.
   -  no need for transfusion (blood, plasma, or platelets) at this time
   - monitor Hct, plts, INR daily
   # Cards pump: EF was normal a few days ago per TEE.  Will not diurese
   further.  Suspect though an element of chronic diastolic dysfunction
   leading to pulm edema in setting of fluid overload and Afib w RVR.
   - rate control with metoprolol
   - continue captopril 12.5 mg TID for afterload reduction.
   - goal i/o : negative but is autodiuresing; will not start lasix
   - continue asa
   # Neuro: right arm neuropathy thought ? [**2-4**] periph nerve damage in
   setting of PICC.  Sensory loss in median nerve distribution.
   Pt states it is worse this morning.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma and morbid obesity. She was admitted with respiratory distress and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's symptoms have improved with the use of BiPAP and increased PEEP. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoventilation, which improved with upright positioning and increased PEEP. Continuous use of BiPAP at night is recommended, with breaks during the day if needed. Optimization of BiPAP settings and an AM ABG will be done to adjust the settings for outside hospital transfer.

2. Hypoxia: The patient is likely hypoxic at baseline due to elevated HCT and hypoxia likely increased by atelectasis. The patient should sit up in a chair and increase PEEP to achieve a goal SaO2 of 88-90%.

3. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient converted back to Afib on 7/24/2130. Amiodarone 400mg IV is continued, and the dose will be changed to 400mg PO daily tomorrow. Digoxin 0.125 is continued, and the level will be checked on 7/27. Metoprolol 37.5mg PO TID will be started and titrated for rate control.

4. Bleeding: There is no active bleeding at this time, but the patient's IN"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with obesity hypoventilation and chronic respiratory failure. She is currently showing substantial improvement with controlled atrial fibrillation, optimization of volume status, and ventilatory support. The patient's baseline status for hypoventilation and atrial arrhythmia has been established.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation:
- The patient is currently being treated with amiodarone, Lopressor, captopril, and heparin.
- It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and adjust medication dosages if necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure:
- The patient needs to continue using BIPAP at 15/10 and have morning ABG to confirm optimal settings.
- The patient should be encouraged to ambulate today.
- Weaning off Advair and prednisone should be considered.
- The patient should undergo PT today.
- Ideally, the patient should be moved to the floor and rehabilitation tomorrow if the response is reasonable.
- Continuing negative fluid balance while maintaining adequate ventilation and oxygenation is crucial.

3. Hemorrhage/Hematoma, Procedure-Related:
- There is no indication of any procedure-related hemorrhage or hematoma in the provided information.

4. Hypoxemia:
- The patient's SpO2 is currently at 90%, which indicates hypoxemia.
- Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and ensuring adequate ventilation and oxygenation is essential.

   so these both may have contributed.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have underlying
   obstructive airway disease which is hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure:  hypoventilation; symptomatically improved
   with upright position and increased PEEP
   - Attempt to use BiPAP continuously at night; can give breaks during
   the day if pt unable.   Will optimize BIPAP settings tonight and get an
   AM ABG in order to rec settings to outside hospital.
   - diagnosis of asthma is questionable; switch nebs to PRN (xopenex due
   to tachy on albuterol & ipatropiium)  and wean steroids to 10mg daily x
   1 more day then off.
   - outpatient referral for bariatric surgery.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma and morbid obesity. She presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), fluid overload, and right ventricular failure (RVF). Additionally, she has a history of bleeding, hypoxia, and neuropathy in her right arm.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's obesity hypoventilation syndrome and questionable asthma put her at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or exacerbation of asthma.

2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's AFib with RVR and RVF increase her risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.

3. Bleeding Complications: The patient's history of bleeding and current use of anticoagulant medications put her at risk for bleeding complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematoma formation.

4. Neurological Complications: The patient's neuropathy in her right arm raises concerns for potential neurological complications such as peripheral nerve damage or pressure ulcers.

5. Infection-related Complications: The patient's presence of burns and the use of invasive lines and devices increase her risk for infection-related complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma and morbid obesity who presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She appears to have obesity hypoventilation syndrome, possibly exacerbated by fluid overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals respiratory acidosis with appropriate chronic renal compensation. She has shown symptomatic improvement with an upright position and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's ABG also shows an elevated HCT, indicating possible chronic hypoxia at baseline. Oxygenation improved overnight with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy. The patient is currently on BiPAP settings of 15/5 and has been tolerating it well, although there is some air leakage around the face mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen if she does not continue to improve with BiPAP therapy and increased PEEP.
2. Hypoxemia: Despite improved oxygenation with BiPAP, the patient's hypoxemia could recur if the therapy is not continued or if other interventions are not effective.
3. Asthma: The diagnosis of asthma is questionable, and there is a possibility of mismanagement or inadequate treatment if the underlying cause of her respiratory distress is not accurately identified.
4. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: This condition may persist if the patient does not lose weight"

   Assessment and Plan
   47F with morbid obesity, likely cardiomyopathy, afib, and hypercarbic
   and hypoxic respiratory failure despite adequate diuresis at [**Location (un) **],
   now doing much better with adjustment of non-invasive ventilation, with
   continued autodiures, better rate control. Pt feels better as well
   though not at baseline. Serial ABGs show better oxygenation but today
   worsening hypercarbia, with a little more wheezing on exam. Wheezing
   still unlikely from reactive airways, but concerning that there is a
   mild change in lung exam in the setting of stopping albuterol and
   starting beta blocker:
   respiratory acidosis: chronic, consistent with probably baseline pCO2;
   unclear why worse this am but probably stable
   -continue bipap at night 15/5; respiratory with try different types of
   mask
   -continue albuterol prn but unlikely changes her physiology
   hypoxia: much improved
   -no need for lasix at this time as pt is autodiuresing
   atrial fibrillation:
   -continue heparin bridge to coumadin
   -continue amiodarone and digoxin for rate control
   -continue beta-clocker but need to reassess lung exam
   arm pain: improving
   -follow up ct scan results
   -prn pain meds
   -awaiting final recs from neuro after ct result
   dispo issues:
   -adjust bipap setting today
   -continue more aggressive PT
   -evaluate pulmonary rehab
   -remain in the ICU for now
   I was physically present with the resident and fellow team for
   discussion of the patient
s clinical course and agree with the note in
   full.  I would add that we have reassuring ABG following a night on
   BIPAP 15/5 with improved oxygenation.  We have emphasized that chronic
   nocturnal and intermittent daytime ventilatory support.
   Would favor move to pulmonary rehab for continued care of chronic
   ventilatory failure.
   BIPAP 15/5 for night time ventilation and will trial with a vented mask
   to evaluate stability of oxygenation in the setting of
dilutional
   effects of O2 delivery via the vented mask.
   Will continue to allow negative fluid balance which should continue to
   be maintained in the setting of improved oxygenation and ventilation
   Will continue with Beta-Blocker therapy for rate control and
   anticoagulation

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with morbid obesity, likely cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on non-invasive ventilation with BIPAP at night. Her oxygenation has improved, but she still has worsening hypercarbia. She is autodiuresing and has been on diuretics. The patient's arm pain is improving, and she is awaiting further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, as indicated by her hypercarbic and hypoxic condition. There is a concern for worsening respiratory acidosis, and she requires continued non-invasive ventilation with BIPAP at night. Different types of masks should be tried to evaluate stability of oxygenation.

2. Arrhythmia: The patient has atrial fibrillation, for which she is on amiodarone and digoxin for rate control. Heparin bridge to coumadin is also being continued.

3. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). She is on systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent DVT.

4. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient is on prophylactic stress ulcer treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 47-year-old female with morbid obesity, likely cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. She is currently being treated in the ICU and has shown improvement with adjustments to her non-invasive ventilation and better rate control. However, her recent ABG results indicate worsening hypercarbia, with a little more wheezing on exam.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. Although she is currently improving, there is a risk of respiratory failure recurring if her respiratory status worsens.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and her current management includes heparin bridge to coumadin, amiodarone, and digoxin for rate control. It is important to monitor her heart rhythm and adjust medication dosages as needed to maintain adequate rate control and prevent complications associated with atrial fibrillation.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to her prolonged immobility in the ICU, the patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT. She is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent this complication.

4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding while"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with morbid obesity, likely cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has shown improvement with adjustment of non-invasive ventilation, continued autodiuresis, and better rate control. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. Although the patient is doing better with adjustment of non-invasive ventilation, there is a concern for worsening hypercarbia and the possibility of respiratory failure if the ventilation settings are not optimized.

2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient likely has cardiomyopathy, which is a condition where the heart muscle becomes weak and enlarged. This can lead to heart failure and reduced cardiac output, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder characterized by rapid and irregular beating. If not properly managed, atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.

4. Obesity-related complications: Morbid obesity increases the risk of various complications, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, and joint problems. These conditions can further exacerbate the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.

5. Deep vein thrombosis ("

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma, morbid obesity, and underlying obstructive airway disease. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, fluid overload, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient has shown improvement with an upright position, increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and the use of BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) at night. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with appropriate chronic renal compensation.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient will continue to be monitored for hypoventilation symptoms and will be given BiPAP continuously at night. The goal is to improve oxygenation and continue auto-diuresis to improve respiratory status.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is expected to improve with the use of BiPAP and by sitting up in a chair with increased PEEP. The target oxygen saturation level is 88-90%.
3. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient has been cardioverted back to sinus rhythm but has since converted back to Afib. She will continue on amiodarone 400 mg PO daily, digoxin 0.125 mg PO daily, metoprolol 37.5 mg PO TID, and coumadin with an INR target of 2.0-3.0. Heparin will be continued, and coagulation will be monitored.
4. Bleeding: There is no active bleeding at present, but the patient's Foley catheter, mucus membranes, and lines will continue to be monitored. Daily monitoring of Hct, Plt, and INR is recommended.
5. Cardiac pump: The patient's ejection fraction was normal a few days ago, and further diuresis is not planned. Chronic diastolic dysfunction leading to pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload and Afib with RVR is suspected. Rate control with metoprolol and afterload reduction with captopril will be continued.
6. Neuro: The patient may have peripheral nerve damage in her right arm due to a PICC line, resulting in sensory loss in the median nerve distribution. A right arm CT scan is pending.
7. Anxiety: The patient will continue to be managed with ativan on a prn basis.
8. FEN (enteral nutrition): The patient will be placed on a regular diet.
9. Skin: Routine wound care for burns and the application of miconazole powder to the groin area will be continued.
10. Access: The patient currently has a PIV (peripheral intravenous) line and an arterial line, which has been discontinued.
11. Prophylaxis: Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (D"

She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure and appears to be experiencing obesity hypoventilation. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/70 to 122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. She weighs 217.3 kg, which is close to her admission weight of 218.2 kg.

The patient has received various treatments including heparin sodium infusion, codeine, and antibiotics. Her arterial line was discontinued involuntarily, and she has been on a heparin drip.

Laboratory results show elevated PTT levels and abnormal values for WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, TCO2, Glucose, and other lab parameters. The patient's ABG reveals respiratory acidosis with appropriate chronic renal compensation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma and morbid obesity. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may be related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and appears to be fluid overloaded. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 118/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. Her weight has decreased slightly since admission.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals respiratory acidosis with appropriate chronic renal compensation. She has shown improvement with the use of BiPAP at night, indicating hypoventilation as a contributing factor. The patient's white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and most electrolyte levels are within normal ranges. However, her creatinine level is elevated, and her calcium and magnesium levels are below normal. Other laboratory results are unremarkable.

The patient's physical examination shows mild wheezing bilaterally, decreased breath sounds at posterior bases, obesity with positive bogginess, and persistent bleeding from a subcutaneous injection site. She also exhibits mild weakness in her right hand grip and increased numbness and discomfort in her right hand. Distal pulses are 2+ in all extremities.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma, morbid obesity, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She presented with hypoventilation, which improved with an upright position and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed respiratory acidosis with chronic renal compensation. She has been diagnosed with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive airway disease, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient is currently on BiPAP for respiratory support, and her oxygenation has improved. She is also being managed with medications for rate control, afterload reduction, and diuresis. The patient's right arm neuropathy is thought to be due to peripheral nerve damage from a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Her condition is stable in the ICU, and plans are being made for discharge to pulmonary rehabilitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation with hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates difficulty in adequately ventilating and oxygenating the body. Continued monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support, such as BiPAP, will be necessary to prevent further respiratory compromise.

2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. This condition increases the risk of complications like stroke and heart failure. Close monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and appropriate management with"

   Assessment and Plan
   47yo woman with h/o questionable hx of asthma and morbid obesity who
   presents with hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be
   obesity hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and
   subsequently in afib with RVR.  These both may have contributed to
   respiratory distress.  Pt may also have underlying obstructive airway
   disease hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic resp failure:  hypoventilation; symptomatically improved
   with upright position and increased PEEP
   - Attempt to use BiPAP continuously at night (use face mask not nasal
   mask as pt is a mouth breather).  On BIPAP setting of 15/5 oxygenation
   is substantially improved.   Patient
s ABG reveals a respiratory
   acidosis with appropriate chronic renal compensation.  Patient likely
   at baseline.  The thought is that with improved oxygenation at night
   she will continue to auto-diurese and continue to improve resp status.
   - Patient may also ventilate more effectively if she sleeps on her
   side.
   - diagnosis of asthma is questionable; switch nebs to PRN (xopenex due
   to tachy on albuterol & ipatropiium)
   - outpatient referral for bariatric surgery.
   - patient qualifies for BIPAP at home and may benefit significantly
   from this.
   - continue work with PT; get OOB and ambulate and monitor resp status
   while ambulating.
   # hypoxia: pt likely hypoxic at baseline as evidenced by her elevated
   HCT,  hypoxia improved o/n with bipap
   - patient to sit up in chair; increase PEEP
   - goal SaO2 88-90%
   # Afib: s/p DCCV; pt was in sinus until [**2130-7-24**] when converted back to
   a-fib
   - Continue amio to 400mg PO daily
   - Increase digoxin from 0.125 to 0.25 today; digoxin level [**2130-7-27**]:
   0.6; repeat digoxin level [**2130-8-1**]
   - Continue metoprolol 37.5mg po TID
   - Continue coumadin ([**7-24**] restarted, increased dose to 10mg 4 days
   ago)  -- INR 2.0.  Monitor coags.
   -  Discontinue heparin gtt today due to therapeutic INR and increased
   PTT
   # Bleeding
 no active bleeding at this time; will continue to monitor
   foley, mucus membranes and lines.
   -  no need for transfusion (blood, plasma, or platelets) at this time
   - monitor Hct, plts, INR daily
   # Cards pump: EF was normal per TEE.  Will not diurese further.
   Suspect an element of chronic diastolic dysfunction leading to pulm
   edema in setting of fluid overload and Afib w RVR.
   - rate control with metoprolol 37.5 po BID
   - continue captopril 12.5 mg TID for afterload reduction.
   - goal i/o : 2L negative/ day, but is autodiuresing with improved
   oxygenation; will not start lasix today; considering starting low dose
   lasix when pt has decreased autodiuresis
   - continue asa

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of questionable asthma and morbid obesity. She presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure and is suspected to have obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient was also found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and appears to be fluid overloaded.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), current temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate (HR) of 85 bpm with a range of 75-105 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 118/70 mmHg with a range of 80-122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute with a range of 7-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated potassium levels (K+ 177 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (Hb 13.9 g/dL), elevated white blood cell count (WBC 10.6 K/uL), and slightly elevated platelet count (Plt 177 K/uL). Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr 0.7 mg/dL), glucose (Glucose 123 mg/dL), calcium (Ca++ 9.1 mg/dL), and magnesium (Mg++ 1.9 mg/dL) are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild wheezing bilaterally, decreased breath sounds at the posterior bases of the lungs, mild weakness in the right hand grip, and pins and needles sensation in the right hand. The patient is also obese with positive body folds.

Based on the assessment, the patient's conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypoxia, atrial fibrillation, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The plan includes continuous use of BiPAP at night with a full face mask, increasing PEEP, and switching nebs to PRN (xopenex due to tachy on albuterol & ipatropiium). The patient is also referred for bariatric surgery and may benefit from BiPAP at home. The patient's medications include amiodarone 400mg PO daily, digoxin, metoprolol 37.5mg po TID, and coumadin with an INR target of 2.0. The patient's bleeding is being monitored, and no active bleeding is present at this time. The patient's cardiac pump function is normal, and diuresis is not expected to improve further. The patient may have chronic diastolic dysfunction leading to pulmonary edema. Rate control with metoprolol and afterload reduction with captopril are planned. The patient's neurologic symptoms are consistent with peripheral nerve damage, and a CT scan of the upper extremity is pending. Anxiety is managed with ativan PRN, and the patient is on a regular diet. Routine wound care is provided for burns, and miconazole powder is applied to the groin area. The patient's access includes a PIV x1, and an A-line was discontinued last night. Prophylactic measures include PPI and bowel regimen. The patient's communication and code status are documented, and she will be discharged to pulmonary rehab."

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress and status asthmaticus. The patient has a history of asthma, which is currently active and chronic. The patient also has a probable diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 108/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on BiPAP support with occasional leaks described as uncomfortable by the patient. 

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse bilateral expiratory wheezes, no signs of acute distress, and no evidence of conjunctival edema, scleral edema, or pallor. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows normal sinus rhythm with occasional atrial fibrillation, distant S2, no murmurs, and no S3 or S4 heart sounds. 

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 13.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 177 K/uL, platelet count of 177 K/uL, sodium level of 101 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. 

The patient's assessment and plan include well-controlled atrial fibrillation with amiodarone, probable OSA, and continued supplemental oxygen. The"

   ASSESSMENT & PLAN:
   47yo woman with h/o questionable hx of asthma and morbid obesity who
   presents with hypercarbic resp failure.  She is obese so this may be
   obesity hypoventilation.  Appears she was fluid overloaded and
   subsequently in afib with RVR.  These both may have contributed to
   respiratory distress.  Pt may also have underlying obstructive airway
   disease hindering ventilation.
   # Hypercarbia/Hypoxia:  most like due to hypoventilation;
   symptomatically improved with upright position and increased PEEP
   - Using BiPAP continuously at night (use face mask not nasal mask as pt
   is a mouth breather).  On BIPAP setting of 15/5 oxygenation is
   substantially improved.   Patient
s ABG reveals a respiratory acidosis
   with appropriate chronic renal compensation.  Patient likely at
   baseline.  The thought is that with improved oxygenation at night she
   will continue to auto-diurese and continue to improve resp status.
   - Patient may also ventilate more effectively if she sleeps on her
   side.
   - diagnosis of asthma is unlikely; patients with obesity
   hypoventilation often have wheezes without true reactive airway
   disease.
 nebs PRN (xopenex due to tachy on albuterol & ipatropiium)
   - outpatient referral for bariatric surgery.
   - patient qualifies for BIPAP at home and may benefit significantly
   from this

   while ambulating.

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity and suspected asthma who presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is experiencing hypoxia and chronic hypoventilation. The patient appears to be fluid overloaded and has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

24-hour events include the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) being in the therapeutic range, leading to discontinuation of her hepatic graft. She tolerated bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) well at a setting of 15/5 and showed improvement in oxygenation. The patient is anxious to leave the ICU but is unable to obtain enough blood for coagulation studies due to a lost peripheral intravenous (PIV) line.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, codeine, and unknown allergens. Her last dose of antibiotics was an infusion. She is currently on various ICU medications and other medications, but specific names are not mentioned. There are no changes to her medical or family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Flowsheet data as of [date] shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's weight remains at 217.3 kg, slightly lower than her admission weight of 218.2 kg. Total fluid intake is 1,028 mL, with 950 mL of that being intravenous fluid. Total output is "

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity who presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She appears to be fluid overloaded and subsequently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's presentation with hypercarbic respiratory failure indicates impaired gas exchange and ventilation. This can lead to respiratory distress and may require mechanical ventilation support.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient seems to be fluid overloaded, which can contribute to pulmonary edema and further compromise respiratory function. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis will be important.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to inadequate cardiac output and increased risk of thromboembolic events. Rate control medications (e.g., metoprolol) and anticoagulation therapy (e.g., coumadin) are recommended.

4. Obstructive Airway Disease: The patient may have underlying obstructive airway disease, which can hinder ventilation. This may require adjustments in respiratory support strategies.

5. Hypoxia: The patient is likely hypoxic at baseline, as evidenced by elevated hematocrit levels. Improving oxygenation with BiPAP or supplemental oxygen will be essential.

6. Diastolic Dysfunction: There is suspicion of chronic diastolic dysfunction leading to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of asthma, which is currently in status asthmaticus. The patient is receiving BiPAP support and is tolerating it well. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/63 to 149/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.37, PCO2 of 68 mmHg, and PO2 of 94%. The patient is also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which has improved with amiodarone and digoxin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and status asthmaticus put him at risk for further respiratory complications such as exacerbation of asthma, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may progress to a more serious arrhythmia, leading to complications like heart failure or cardiac arrest.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The fluctuating blood pressures indicate potential hemodynamic instability, which could lead to shock or organ dysfunction.
4. Infection: Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an obese male with a history of chronic asthma, currently experiencing respiratory distress. He is in the ICU and has been receiving BiPAP support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 115/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. He has atrial fibrillation but is responding well to medication. The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating autodiuresis. His laboratory values show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 13.9 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 177 K/uL, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. The patient has a history of chronic asthma, which is currently in status asthmaticus. He is stable and improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is at 91%, indicating potential hypoxemia. Close monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 13.9 g/dL. Further investigation into the cause of anemia and appropriate management is required.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as thromboembolism.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's net"
