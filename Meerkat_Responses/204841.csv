","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of headache post coital. He presented with a fever of 101.8°F and an irregular narrow complex tachycardia resembling flutter with variable block. His blood cultures, urine culture, and electrocardiogram (ECG) have been obtained. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history, but his family and medical records have been reviewed. He is on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and drains in place. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure between 140-160 mmHg, heart rate in the 100-110 range, respiratory rate at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has been receiving propofol for sedation, hydromorphone for pain management, famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and fentanyl for pain relief. He is also on keppra for seizure prophylaxis and nimodipine for cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis. His electrolytes and magnesium levels are within normal limits, and his renal function is stable. However, his white blood cell count is elevated at 17.3 K/uL. 

The patient's neurological status is being closely monitored, with neuro checks every hour. He has bilateral ventriculostomy drains in place due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). His pain,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 28-year-old male with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, status post coiling.
- The patient underwent craniectomy and hematoma evacuation, and a ventriculostomy was performed.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by increasing intracranial pressures (ICPs), fever, and possible diabetes insipidus (DI).
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation, with paralyzed muscle tone due to medication.
- Neurologic monitoring is continuous with EEG.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with controlled blood pressure and heart rate.
- There are concerns about electrolyte and fluid disorders, as well as the origin of the fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased Intracranial Pressures (ICPs): The patient's ICPs are increasing, which can lead to brain herniation and further neurological deterioration.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process. It needs to be investigated to prevent complications such as sepsis.
3. Diabetes Insipidus (DI): The patient's high sodium levels and polyuria suggest DI, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not managed appropriately.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and is suspected to have an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. He underwent coiling, craniectomy, and hematoma evacuation. The patient is currently in the ICU with increasing intracranial pressures (ICPs), intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. He has a ventriculostomy in place, and various medications are being administered to manage his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased Intracranial Pressures (ICPs): The patient's ICPs are increasing, which can lead to further brain damage, herniation, or decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).
2. Pulmonary Complications: Being intubated and on mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, volutrauma, and oxygen toxicity.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status needs close monitoring due to potential hemodynamic instability, arrhythmias, and the effects of vasoactive medications.
4. Renal Complications: The patient is showing signs of diabetes insipidus (DI) with high serum sodium levels. This condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent renal dysfunction.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: Although not currently present, the patient is at risk for stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness and prolonged bed rest"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male admitted to the ICU with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. He underwent coiling of the aneurysm, craniectomy, and hematoma evacuation. The patient is currently experiencing increasing intracranial pressures (ICPs) and is in a pentobarb coma. He has bilateral ventriculostomy drains in place and is on multiple medications including Keppra, nimodipine, mannitol, and propofol for sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased intracranial pressures (ICPs): The patient's ICPs are increasing, which can lead to further brain injury, herniation, and potential death if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple lines and tubes, including an endotracheal tube, arterial line, and bilateral ventriculostomy drains, which increase the risk of infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylaxis with boots is recommended to prevent this complication.
4. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and the use of mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of stress ulcers. H2 blocker prophylaxis is being used to prevent this complication.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent hyperglycemia, which can worsen outcomes in critically ill patients.
6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, including elevated sodium levels and potential imbalances in other electrolytes. Close monitoring and careful management are required to prevent further complications.
7. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been febrile, and the source of the fever needs to be identified and treated promptly to prevent complications associated with infection.
8. Autonomic dysfunction: The patient may experience autonomic dysregulation, leading to fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate, which can impact organ perfusion and function.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's condition and potential complications based on the provided progress note. The actual medical complications may vary, and additional information from further evaluation and testing may be necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old male with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to an aneurysm rupture. He underwent coiling of the aneurysm, craniectomy, and hematoma evacuation. The patient is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing increasing intracranial pressures (ICPs). His vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F (38.8°C), blood pressure ranging from 195/97 mmHg to 146/60 mmHg, heart rate between 104-106 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient has a history of diabetes insipidus, and his electrolytes are slightly imbalanced. He is receiving multiple medications including phenylephrine, norepinephrine, famotidine, and regular insulin for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and prolonged bed rest may predispose him to stress ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of headache post coital. He has a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, which was treated with coiling. The patient also underwent craniectomy and hematoma evacuation. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has increasing intracranial pressures (ICPs). The patient's vital signs include a fever of 101.9°F, tachycardia, and hypertension. He is receiving multiple medications including phenylephrine, norepinephrine, famotidine, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection. This needs to be further evaluated and treated if necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure readings (<180 mmHg) suggest hypotension. This could be due to the use of vasodilators like phenylephrine and norepinephrine, or it could indicate septic shock.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's intermittent hypoxia and the need for increased FiO2 and PEEP on the ventilator indicate respiratory distress. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
4. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's ICPs have been increasing, which"
