   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F w/ a h/o CHF (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no CAD from cath
   [**2-1**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with
   urosepsis, atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.
   .
   # Urosepsis: Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt with
   history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH. Appears euvolemic on exam and
   continues to require low dose of levophed. Lactate 1.5 on presentation
   here, CVP 10.  Neg for Influenza AB and MRSA screen osh.
   - f/u OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data
   - measure CVP, goal [**10-3**], will fluid resuscitate gently with hopes of
   being able to discontinue levophed
   - measure SvO2, lactate to assess perfusion given history of
   cardiomyopathy and EF 20%
   - on meropenem given prior cx data and multiple drug allergies
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.
   - continue statin, aspirin
   - wean off pressors as tolerated
   - resume carvedilol once off pressors
   - resume home lasix dosing once off pressors
   - may need to change CVL
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   urosepsis. Anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission at OSH.
   - change amio to po load (400 [**Hospital1 **] x 7d, to end [**11-12**])
   - continue coumadin, monitor level closely given interaction with
   amiodarone
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of urosepsis compounded by acute on chronic renal failure.
   - aspirin and statin, holding carvedilol until off of pressors
   - d/c asa.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.
   - give fluid as needed.
   - renal US on [**11-7**]

   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.
   - continue 5mg po prednisone, if persistently hypotensive would add
   stress dose
   - consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim test if pressor requirement persists after
   infection appears controlled
   .
   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Has done well
   previously on sliding scale insulin without fixed dose regimen.
   - continue humalog SS ACHS

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) with a biventricular pacemaker. She presented with urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia.

The patient was started on meropenem and switched to imipenem due to allergies. She is euvolemic on examination and continues to require a low dose of levophed (norepinephrine). Her lactate level is 1.5, and central venous pressure (CVP) is 10. She is negative for influenza A and B and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screen at the outside hospital.

The plan includes following up on outside hospital urine culture and blood culture data, measuring CVP with a goal of 10-13, and gently fluid resuscitating in hopes of discontinuing levophed. SvO2 and lactate levels will be monitored to assess perfusion given the patient's history of cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction (EF) of 20%.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include pump failure (s/p biventricular placement), rhythm control for atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease management, acute on chronic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease, and a pacemaker. She presented with urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. The patient is euvolemic and continues to require a low dose of levophed. Her lactate level on presentation was 1.5, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is 10. She does not have influenza AB or MRSA infection. The patient has been started on meropenem due to her drug allergies and prior culture data.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient is already experiencing urosepsis, which can lead to further complications such as septic shock, organ dysfunction, and multiple organ failure.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, the demand ischemia, and the presence of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3-1.5 and a current creatinine level of 2.6. This could potentially worsen, leading to further renal dysfunction.
4. Thromboembolic events: As the patient is ant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who presents with urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR), and demand ischemia. She has multiple drug allergies and is currently on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. Her vital signs show fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and increased respiratory rate. She requires low-dose norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and acute kidney injury. She has a history of chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and hemodynamic support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing infection and hemodynamic instability.
2. Acute kidney injury exacerbation due to hypotension and infection.
3. Cardiogenic shock secondary to worsening heart failure or demand ischemia.
4. Ventricular arrhythmias or worsening atrial fibrillation.
5. Pressure ulcers or deep vein thrombosis (D"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who presented to the hospital with urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia. She was admitted to the ICU and started on meropenem due to drug allergies. Her condition has been stable, but she continues to require low-dose levophed. She has a history of enterobactor infection sensitive to cefepime, and was initially treated with zosyn before switching to meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of urosepsis and enterobactor infection suggests a risk of ongoing or recurrent infections. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
2. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's chronic CHF with an ejection fraction of 20-30% increases the risk of further cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring of heart rhythm, blood pressure, and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1.3-1.5 and current level of 2.6 indicate acute on chronic renal failure. Frequent assessment of renal function and prompt management of fluid balance and medications are essential.
4. Thromboembolic events: Due to the patient's immobil"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block (LBBB) with a biventricular pacemaker (BiV pacer). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with suspected sepsis and acute on chronic renal failure. 

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Infection: Sepsis - The patient appears euvolemic on examination and continues to require low-dose levophed. Lactate levels were 1.5 on presentation here, CVP is 10, and she is negative for influenza AB and MRSA screen at the other hospital. 
2. Pump dysfunction: The patient had a biventricular (BiV) placement on [**8-31**]. She reports using lasix 20 mg at home, although no record from the other hospital. She is euvolemic on admission.
3. Rhythm disturbance: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is now rate-controlled. She is likely worsened by underlying sepsis. She is anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission at the other hospital.
4. Coronaries: No known CAD as per catheterization, but likely demand ischemia in the setting of u"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (EF 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block with a biventricular pacemaker. She was admitted with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. The patient's current conditions include infection: sepsis (complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of EF 20%), pump: s/p biventricular placement, rhythm: atrial fibrillation, now rate-controlled - likely worsened by underlying sepsis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of further deterioration in cardiac function, leading to heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias.

2. Infectious complications: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which could lead to additional infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

3. Renal complications: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease or the need for renal replacement therapy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit and has undergone multiple tests including stool culture and nasal swab for influenza. The presence of fever along with these tests suggests a possible infection in the body.

2. Allergic Reactions: The patient has listed allergies to various medications such as morphine, Demerol (meperidine Hcl), Levaquin (levofloxacin), Benadryl (diphenhydramine Hcl), Cymbalta (duloxetine Hcl), Celexa (citalopram hydrobromide), Remeron (mirtazapine), and others. This indicates that the patient may have hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to these specific medications.

3. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing confusion and delirium, which is indicated by the presence of medications like Benadryl (diphenhydramine Hcl) and Demerol (meperidine Hcl) in their allergy list. Delirium can be caused by various factors including infections, medication side effects, or withdrawal symptoms.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -229 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating that there may be an"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block (LBBB) post biventricular pacemaker (BiV) placement. She presented to the hospital with unclear mental status, suspected sepsis and urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Upon admission, the patient was found to have an elevated lactate level of 1.5, central venous pressure (CVP) of 10, negative for influenza AB and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screen, and ongoing urine and blood cultures. The patient was already on meropenem and azithromycin due to prior culture data and drug allergies.

The patient's current condition includes altered/depressed mental status thought to be due to sepsis, pump failure secondary to BiV placement, and atrial fibrillation now rate-controlled but likely worsened by underlying sepsis. The patient is anticoagulated with therapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) since admission.

The assessment and plan include ongoing sepsis workup, monitoring of C"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, and no coronary artery disease. She presented to the hospital with suspected sepsis and urinary tract infection, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. The patient was euvolemic on examination and required low-dose levophed. Her lactate level was 1.5 at presentation. She was negative for influenza AB and MRSA screen. She had a history of enterobacter sensitive to cefepime, but was started on zosyn and switched to meropenem at the outside hospital. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her physical examination revealed altered mental status, clear to auscultate lungs bilaterally, regular rapid regular rhythm, and no murmurs. 

The patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 14.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 20 mEq/L, calcium of 81 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL, phosphate of 4.5 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 2.0 mmol/L. Her blood cultures were negative for influenza AB and MRSA. Other lab results showed elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and a slightly low platelet count. 

The patient's medical history includes chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease, and a history of left bundle branch block after biventricular pacemaker placement. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Infection: Sepsis complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient has a history of enterobacter sensitive to cefepime, but was started on zosyn and switched to meropenem at the outside hospital. She appears euvolemic on examination and continues to require low-dose levophed. Lactate level was 1.5 on presentation here, central venous pressure (CVP) 10, and negative for influenza AB and MRSA screen. 
- Follow up on outside hospital urine culture and blood culture data.
- Measure CVP, goal 10-3, will fluid resuscitate gently with hopes of being able to discontinue levophed.
- Measure mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), lactate to assess"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, and no coronary artery disease (CAD) from a previous catheterization. The patient presents with sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the setting of a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. 

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, with measurements of central venous pressure (CVP), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), lactate levels, and renal function tests. The patient is also on medications such as meropenem, azithromycin, amiodarone, and warfarin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CHF and low EF, there is a risk of worsening heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation.

2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute on chronic renal failure, and the ongoing sepsis and use of nephrotoxic drugs may further compromise renal function.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to endotracheal intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

   TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   20-25 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
   depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
   apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
   to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
   pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
   ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. The degree of
   mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. The degree of aortic
   stenosis has incrased slightly. LV systolic function remains severely
   depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
   on the prior study.
   CXR: Improved pulmonary edema which is now mild with stable left
   perihilar opacity, worsened since [**2168-11-6**] and is most likely
   consolidation, probably pneumonia,less likely asymmetrical pulmonary
   edema.

   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.
   - give fluid as needed, currently has hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis, consider bicarb as needed
   - azotemia continue to get worse (GI bleed)
   - no renal findings on CT
   - renal consult
 ATN, trend creatinine and UOP
   .
   # supertherapeutic INR: likely due to drug drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - f/u amio and inhibitor screen
   - consider thyroid
   - trend LFTs and serum ammonia
   - consider trial of lactulose
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis. Anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission at OSH.
   - change amio to po load (400 [**Hospital1 **] x 7d, to end [**11-12**])
   - continue coumadin, monitor level closely given interaction with
   amiodarone
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.
   - continue statin, aspirin
   - wean off pressors as tolerated
   - resume carvedilol once off pressors
   - resume home lasix dosing once off pressors
   - CVL resighted
   - A-line for MAP
   - IVF with I/O goal of 1L +.
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of urosepsis compounded by acute on chronic renal failure.
   - aspirin and statin, holding carvedilol until off of pressors

   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.
   - continue 5mg po prednisone, if persistently hypotensive would add
   stress dose
   - random [**Last Name (un) **] appropriate

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Infection parameters improving. Source remains unclear. Continue
   antibiotics. Mental status not clearing. Most consistent with toxic
   metabolic cause but will need CT to exclude CNS bleed given risk
   factors.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who presented with unclear sepsis and urinary tract infection (UTI). She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and demand ischemia.

The patient's current condition includes euvolemia, mild pulmonary edema with stable left perihilar opacity, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25%), moderately dilated left ventricular cavity, mild aortic valve stenosis, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. She is on multiple medications including meropenem and azithromycin due to drug allergies.

The patient's medical complications and potential risks include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, possibly complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR in the setting of a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20%.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with worsening azotemia and an increase in creatinine levels.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 101, which is lower than normal.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT / AST"

   apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
   to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
   pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
   ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. The degree of
   mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. The degree of aortic
   stenosis has incrased slightly. LV systolic function remains severely
   depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
   on the prior study.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block (LBBB) who presented to the hospital with suspected sepsis and atrial fibrillation. She has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supertherapeutic INR, and chronic conditions such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient underwent bi-ventricular pacing placement and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's initial presentation with suspected sepsis and UTI indicates a risk for ongoing or recurrent infections.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to several factors including sepsis, medication interactions, or other underlying conditions.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function suggests the need for careful fluid management and consideration of interventions to improve renal function.
4. Supertherapeutic INR: The patient's elevated INR may be due to drug interactions, liver dysfunction, or other factors, which could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Cardiac Function: The patient has a history of CHF and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Her recent TTE showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and moderate to severe mit"

   TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   20-25 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
   depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
   apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
   to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
   pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-4-20**], the left
   ventricular cavity appears dilated on the current study. The degree of
   mitral regurgitation has increased significantly. The degree of aortic
   stenosis has incrased slightly. LV systolic function remains severely
   depressed, although the ventricle does not appear as dyssynchronous as
   on the prior study.
   CXR:
   Improved pulmonary edema which is now mild with stable left perihilar
   opacity,
   worsened since [**2168-11-6**] and is most likely consolidation,
   probably
   pneumonia,less likely asymmetrical pulmonary edema.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) with a pacemaker who presents as out of hospital transfer with possible sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- She is euvolemic on exam.
- She has a mild left perihilar opacity on chest X-ray, which is suggestive of left-sided pneumonia.
- She is on meropenem and azithromycin due to multiple drug allergies and prior culture data.
- She has a history of enterobactor sensitivity to cefepime, but was started on zosyn and then switched to meropenem at the outside hospital (OSH).
- She has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-30%.
- She has a history of LBBB with a biventricular (BiV) pacemaker placement on [**8-31**].
- She is using lasix 20mg at home, although there is no record from OSH.
- She is currently euvolemic.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD), and a pacemaker for left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient presented with unclear sepsis and urinary tract infection (UTI), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and ischemic demand in the setting of an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient also has a history of enterobactor sensitivity to cefepime, and was initially started on zosyn and switched to imipenem at the outside hospital (OSH).

The patient appears euvolemic on examination. Further investigations include OSH urine culture and blood culture data, chest X-ray suggestive of left perihilar pneumonia, and sputum culture. The patient is currently on meropenem and azithromycin for a 6-day course based on prior culture data and multiple drug allergies. Infectious disease (ID) consultation recommended the same treatment plan.

The patient is also experiencing altered/depressed mental status (MS) thought to be due to Ativan yesterday, not retaining CO2, toxic-metabolic. A head CT was performed, which showed no abnormalities. The patient was started on stress dose steroids, and consideration for an electroencephalogram (EEG) is being made.

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making

   Afebrile on antibiotics.
   Continue hydration, antibiotics

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block (LBBB) who presented with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including infection/sepsis, altered/depressed mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supertherapeutic INR, rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation), pump failure (biventricular pacing), coronary artery disease, chronic Clostridium difficile infection, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/48 mmHg to 90/25 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg. The patient's weight has increased from 63 kg at admission to 77.3 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (24.5 K/uL), low hemoglobin (8.5 g/dL), high creatinine (2.9 mg/dL), high glucose levels (270 mg/dL), and an INR of 6.2. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing with meropenem and azithromycin, monitoring urine and blood cultures, administering stress dose steroids, considering an electroencephalogram (EEG), evaluating thyroid function, and considering a lumbar puncture (LP). The patient's fluid status is being managed, and renal function is being monitored. The patient's coagulation status is being closely monitored due to the use of amiodarone and potential drug interactions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential neurological complications due to altered mental status.

It is important to note that the patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently in the ICU, indicating a high level of acuity and risk for complications. Close monitoring and management are crucial in this case."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease, and a pacemaker for left bundle branch block. She presented to the hospital with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/48 mmHg to 90/25 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support.

The physical examination reveals an increasingly somnolent patient with a diffusely tender abdomen. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.5 thousand cells/microliter, an elevated creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL, and hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level of 270 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate possible infections, liver dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's current medications include methylprednisolone, azithromycin, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, amiodarone, lasix, statin, aspirin, and various other medications for her chronic conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include sepsis-related complications such as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), acute kidney injury (AKI) due to acute on chronic renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and respiratory failure. The patient's altered mental status may indicate a possible central nervous system (CNS) involvement, which could be due to various causes including toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, infection, or other underlying conditions. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and demand ischemia suggests potential cardiac complications. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II and chronic renal failure increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to promptly identify and manage any potential complications that may arise."

   # Infection: Sepsis [**1-25**] Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF
   20%. Pt with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was
   started on zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.  Appears euvolemic on
   exam.
   - f/u OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data
   - CXR suggestive of L perihilar PNA, sputum culture.
   - on meropenem and azithromycin given prior cx data and multiple drug
   allergies
   - ID consulted recs as above
   - DFA

   - LFTs normal, CT A/P showed no infectious source
   .
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 thought to be [**1-25**] to ativan yesterday, not
   retaining CO2,
   - head CT given AMS if not resolved after 24hours from ativan and
   supertherapeutic INR
   - consider stress dose steroids.
   - continue monitor
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.
   - give fluid as needed, currently has hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis, consider bicarb as needed
   - azotemia continue to get worse (GI bleed)
   - no renal findings on CT
   - renal consult
 ATN, trend creatinine and UOP
   .
   # supertherapeutic INR: likely due to drug drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - f/u amio and inhibitor screen
   - consider thyroid
   - trend LFTs and serum ammonia
   - consider trial of lactulose
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis. Anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission at OSH.
   - change amio to po load (400 [**Hospital1 **] x 7d, to end [**11-12**])
   - continue coumadin, monitor level closely given interaction with
   amiodarone
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.
   - continue statin, aspirin
   - wean off pressors as tolerated
   - resume carvedilol once off pressors
   - resume home lasix dosing once off pressors
   - CVL resighted
   - A-line for MAP
   - IVF with I/O goal of 1L +.
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of urosepsis compounded by acute on chronic renal failure.
   - aspirin and statin, holding carvedilol until off of pressors
   - d/c asa.
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.
   - continue 5mg po prednisone, if persistently hypotensive would add
   stress dose
   - random [**Last Name (un) **] appropriate
   .
   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Has done well
   previously on sliding scale insulin without fixed dose regimen.
   - continue humalog SS ACHS

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block with a bi-ventricular pacemaker. The patient presents with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Infection: Sepsis due to an unknown source, possibly urinary tract infection (UTI) given the history of enterobacter sensitivity to cefepime. The patient was started on meropenem and azithromycin due to multiple drug allergies. Further investigations are pending, including urine and blood cultures.
2. Altered Mental Status: Thought to be due to ativan, which may cause memory retention issues. A head CT was given to assess for any other causes of altered mental status, such as acute mental status change (AMS) or supertherapeutic INR. Consideration for stress dose steroids is also mentioned.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine levels were 1.3-1.5, but the patient presented with a creatinine level of 2.6. Fluid management and bicarbonate therapy are recommended to address the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Renal consultation is pending to further evaluate and manage the worsening azotemia,"

   # Infection: Sepsis [**1-25**] Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF
   20%. Pt with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was
   started on zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.  Appears euvolemic on
   exam.
   - f/u OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data

   retaining CO2, toxic-metabolic
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was trialed [**11-10**] yesterday with no improvement
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage

   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues.
   - give fluid as needed, currently has hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis, consider bicarb as needed
   - started maintenance fluids, addl boluses as tolerated
   - azotemia persists despite hydration; renal feels that this remains
   [**1-25**] pre-renal insufficiency
   - no renal findings on CT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block (LBBB) post biventricular (BiV) pacemaker placement. The patient presents with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia.

The patient has multiple medical complications including infection (sepsis), altered/depressed mental status (MS), acute on chronic renal failure, supertherapeutic INR, rhythm disturbance (afib), and chronic conditions such as hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly. The source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.

2. Altered/Depressed Mental Status (MS): The patient's MS may be due to various factors including sepsis, medications, or metabolic disturbances. Close monitoring and appropriate management are required to improve the patient's mental status.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and the recent acute exacerbation needs to be managed carefully. Fluid balance, electrolyte disturbances, and az"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Physical Examination
   Slightly more alert today.
   Medical Decision Making
   Regarding mental obtundation secondary to toxic/metabolic causes.
   Azotemia most likely factor and not improving. Will increase free water

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block with a biventricular pacemaker. The patient presented to the hospital with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:
1. Infection: Sepsis, complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of an ejection fraction of 20%. The patient has a history of enterobactor sensitive to cefepime but was started on zosyn and switched to imipenem at the outside hospital. The patient appears euvolemic on examination.
2. Altered/Depressed Mental Status: Thought to be due to lorazepam yesterday, not retaining CO2, toxic-metabolic. Head CT was normal, lactulose was trialed yesterday with no improvement, and no appreciable response to stress dose steroids. TSH was within normal range; fT4 and T3 were slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this clinical picture.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on presentation to the outside hospital. The creatinine has improved"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F w/ a h/o CHF (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no CAD from cath
   [**2-1**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with ?sepsis,
   atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.
   .
   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.  Appears euvolemic on exam.
   - f/u OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data
 so far no positive data
   - after d/w rads, felt that CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely
   edema instead
   - on meropenem and azithromycin [**6-29**] day course given prior cx data and
   multiple drug allergies
   - ID consulted recs as above
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 3, OSH line pulled
 tip pending. UCX-
   Negative here, BCX
 negative thus far
   - LFTs normal, CT A/P showed no infectious source
   .
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 thought to be [**1-25**] to ativan yesterday, not
   retaining CO2, toxic-metabolic
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was trialed [**11-10**] yesterday with no improvement
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues.
   - give fluid as needed, currently has hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis, consider bicarb as needed
   - started maintenance fluids, addl boluses as tolerated
   - azotemia persists despite hydration; renal feels that this remains
   [**1-25**] pre-renal insufficiency
   - no renal findings on CT
   .
   # supertherapeutic INR: likely due to drug drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/c
d, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now downtrending after amio was d/ced
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis. Anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin
   - continue rate control with BB
   - holding coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.
   - continue statin, aspirin
   - IVF with I/O goal of 1L+.
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of urosepsis compounded by acute on chronic renal failure.
   - aspirin and statin, holding carvedilol until off of pressors
   - d/c asa.
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.
   - d/ced stress dose steroids
   .
   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Has done well
   previously on sliding scale insulin without fixed dose regimen.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease, and left bundle branch block with a pacemaker. She was admitted to the hospital with suspected sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

2. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and imipenem, due to drug allergies. She is currently being treated with meropenem and azithromycin.

3. Initial tests showed elevated white blood cell count, but subsequent tests have shown improvement. Blood cultures have been negative so far.

4. The patient has altered mental status, which is thought to be due to toxic-metabolic causes. She has been given lactulose and stress dose steroids, but without improvement.

5. Her renal function has shown improvement with hydration, but she still has azotemia. The cause is believed to be pre-renal insufficiency.

6. The patient has a supertherapeutic INR, which may be due to drug-drug interactions or liver dysfunction. The INR is now downtrending after discontinuing amiodarone.

7. The patient was treated for atrial fibrillation with amiodarone initially, but it was discontinued due to interactions with warfarin. She is now rate-controlled and anticoagulated"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F w/ a h/o CHF (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no CAD from cath
   [**2-1**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with ?sepsis,
   atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.

   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.
   - OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data - no positive data

   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of [**Last Name (un) 4158**] origin. 3-Digit BUN

   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was trialed [**11-10**] yesterday with no improvement
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues.
   - started maintenance fluids, addl boluses as tolerated
   - azotemia persists despite hydration; renal feels that this remains
   [**1-25**] pre-renal insufficiency
   - Plan for HD line placement in AM
   - no renal findings on CT
   .

   # supertherapeutic INR: likely due to drug drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/c
d, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now downtrending after amio was d/ced
   - Vitamin K given this AM in anticipation of HD line placement in AM

   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB

   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   - continue statin, aspirin
   - Will start HD in AM, consider running negative if persistent O2 need
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin and statin, holding carvedilol until off of pressors
   - d/c asa wil clarify reason.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, and left bundle branch block who presented with suspected sepsis, atrial fibrillation, and demand ischemia. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient has multiple medical complications, including infection, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supertherapeutic INR, rhythm disturbances, and pump dysfunction. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments to address these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's initial presentation with suspected sepsis indicates an infection, which could potentially worsen if not properly managed.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion and delirium may be related to her infection, medication interactions, or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and management are essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to ongoing azotemia and potential renal insufficiency.
4. Supertherapeutic INR: The patient's elevated INR levels require careful management to avoid excessive bleeding risks.
5. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient's atrial fibrillation and demand ischemia need to be closely monitored and managed to maintain stable heart rhythm and prevent complications.
6. Pump Dysfunction: The patient's pump dysfunction, likely related to her underlying heart condition,"

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) post biventricular (BiV) pacemaker. She presents with suspected sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia. The patient has multiple drug allergies and is currently being treated with meropenem and azithromycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is being treated for a suspected infection, possibly pneumonia or urinary tract infection, as indicated by the use of antibiotics. The infection could be complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR in the setting of reduced ejection fraction (EF 20%).

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated baseline creatinine level of 1.3-1.5 and a current creatinine level of 2.6. Despite hydration, azotemia persists, suggesting acute on chronic renal failure. Further evaluation and management are needed.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to toxic-metabolic causes. Head CT results are normal, and lactulose has been trialed without improvement. Stress dose steroids have not shown any appreciable response.

   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.
   - OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data - no positive data
   - CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema instead
   - on meropenem and azithromycin [**6-29**] day course given prior cx data and
   multiple drug allergies

   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of [**Last Name (un) 4158**] origin. 3-Digit BUN
   clearly playing a role, not retaining CO2
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was trialed [**11-10**] yesterday with no improvement
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues.
   - started maintenance fluids, addl boluses as tolerated
   - azotemia persists despite hydration; renal feels that this remains
   [**1-25**] pre-renal insufficiency
   - Plan for HD line placement in AM
   - no renal findings on CT
   .
   .

   # supertherapeutic INR: likely due to drug drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/c
d, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now downtrending after amio was d/ced
   - Vitamin K given this AM in anticipation of HD line placement in AM

   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - holding coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   - continue statin, aspirin
   - Will start HD in AM, consider running negative if persistent O2 need
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin and statin, holding carvedilol until off of pressors
   - d/c asa wil clarify reason.
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence, (-) x4 though very few
   things given WBC counts of >25

   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.
   - d/ced stress dose steroids

   agree with the above note and plans.

   Medical Decision Making
   Patient seen and examined on [**11-13**] but note not available for
   cosigning.
   Plan outlined on work rounds and detailed above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block (LBBB) who presented with possible sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The patient's current conditions include infection (fever of unknown origin), acute on chronic renal failure, supertherapeutic INR (likely due to drug-drug interaction), rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation with rate control), and pump dysfunction (s/p biventricular pacemaker placement).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of enterobactor infection which is sensitive to cefepime. She was started on zosyn and switched to imipenem. There is no evidence of infection in the urine or blood cultures, and the chest X-ray does not indicate pneumonia. However, the patient remains at risk for further infections due to immunosuppression.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with persisting azotemia despite hydration. Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis, may be required to manage the renal failure.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supertherapeutic INR due to drug-drug interactions, liver dysfunction, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, and no coronary artery disease. She presented to the hospital with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. The patient has multiple medical allergies and was previously on meropenem, but switched to imipenem due to allergies. She also received azithromycin for five days and was followed by the ID team. Her current condition includes altered/depressed mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR, atrial fibrillation, and pump failure with biventricular pacemaker placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of sepsis and enterobacter sensitivity suggests a risk of infection. Monitoring for any signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed is crucial.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure indicates impaired kidney function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and considering dialysis if indicated may be necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's supratherapeutic INR due to drug-drug interactions and potential liver dysfunction highlights the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and adjusting anticoagulant therapy accordingly is essential.
4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's history of congestive heart failure, demand ischemia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response indicate a"

   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   - HD for presumably symptomatic azotemia

   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues.
   - started maintenance fluids, addl boluses as tolerated
   - azotemia persists despite hydration; renal feels that this remains
   [**1-25**] pre-renal insufficiency
   - Plan for HD line placement in AM

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Physical Examination
   Remains severely obtunded.
   Possible slight abdominal tenderness.
   Lab: Lipase 120, BUN 100.
   Medical Decision Making
   Underlying pathology remains a mystery. Elevated lipase suggests
   possible pancreatic or small bowel  lesion, although little other
   supporting data. Cause of prerenal azotemia also unknown with little
   response to hydration.  Need to evaluate further for underlying
   malignancy. PLan for abdominal CT with contrast.

   on:[**2168-11-14**] 18:44 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of enterobactor infection and was previously treated with zosyn and then switched to imipenem. Although the urine and blood cultures were negative, the patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing infection.

2. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.3-1.5, but it increased to 2.6 on presentation. Despite hydration, azotemia persists, indicating acute on chronic renal failure. The plan for hemodialysis (HD) placement in the morning suggests a need for renal support.

3. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated due to drug interactions (amio vs. flagyl vs. abx) and possible liver dysfunction. This increases the risk of bleeding.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which was likely worsened by underlying sepsis. Rate control has been achieved, but anticoagulation remains a concern.

5. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-30%. The patient also has a pacemaker in place and is experiencing demand ischemia. Coronary artery disease (CAD) has been ruled out, but there may still be issues related to poor forward flow and fluid"

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) with a biventricular (BiV) pacemaker. She presents with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including infection (FUO), altered/depressed mental status (MS), acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR due to drug-drug interactions and liver dysfunction, rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation), and pump dysfunction (BiV placement).

The patient has a history of chronic conditions such as chronic C. Diff, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and type II diabetes mellitus (DMII). She is currently being managed for various issues, including fluid overload, pre-renal azotemia, mild hypotension, CHF, coronary artery disease, chronic C. Diff, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and DMII.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of FUO and was previously treated with antibiotics. There is a possibility of recurring or new infections.
2. Altered/Depressed Mental Status (MS): The patient has altered/depressed MS, which can be due to toxic/met"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F w/ a h/o CHF (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no CAD from cath
   [**2-1**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with ?sepsis,
   atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.
   .
   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.   OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data -
   no positive data.  CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema
   instead.
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 3, OSH line pulled
 tip pending. UCX-
   Negative here, BCX
 negative thus far
   - LFTs normal, CT A/P showed no infectious source
   - on meropenem [**6-29**] day course given prior cx data and multiple drug
   allergies (following ID rec)
   - azithromycin d/ced, finished 5 day course
   - ID following; will discuss empirically starting PO vancomycin for C.
   diff seeing as no improvement thus far and strong past medical history
   of C. diff
   .
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  Stress dose steroids had
   been stopped several days ago and are unlikely source.  Concern for
   oncologic source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.
   - f/u final read of CT chest/abd/pel as source of lymphadenopathy
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - peripheral smear ordered; H/O consult
   .
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of unknown origin. 3-Digit BUN
   clearly playing a role, not retaining CO2
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] yesterday with no improvement
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   - HD for presumably symptomatic azotemia
   - send serum ammonia to assess hepatic vs. renal source for asterixis
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues.
   - started maintenance fluids, addl boluses as tolerated
   - azotemia persists despite hydration; renal feels that this remains
   [**1-25**] pre-renal insufficiency
   - Plan for HD line placement in AM
   - no renal findings on CT
   .
   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/c
d, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now near normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - holding coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   - continue statin, aspirin
   - Will start HD in AM, consider running negative if persistent O2 need
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin and statin, holding carvedilol until off of pressors
   - d/c asa wil clarify reason.
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence, (-) x4 though very few
   things given WBC counts of >25
   - Toxin B assay (send out) pending, has higher sensitivity
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.
   - d/ced stress dose steroids
   .
   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Has done well
   previously on sliding scale insulin without fixed dose regimen.
   - continue humalog SS ACHS

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Have reviewed events and study results as above.
   Physical Examination
   No change
   Medical Decision Making
   We remain without good explanation for metabolic encephalopathy, slow
   to resolve prerenal azotemia, and now worsening leukocytosis in the
   absence of obvious infectious source.  Will ask for manual WBC
   differential and consult ID and GI re possibility of undiagnosed
   recurrence of C diff infection.  If reasonable possibility will
   consider trial of oral Vancomycin.
    Volume status at this point at least euvolemic and probably slightly
   overloaded.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease, and left bundle branch block. She presented to the hospital with unclear sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including infection, leukocytosis, altered/depressed mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR, rhythm disturbances, and heart pump failure.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 128/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination findings include rales in the posterior lungs bilaterally, diffuse tenderness throughout the abdomen, noticeable edema in the left arm compared to the right, and no evidence of pancreatitis on CT scan.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, elevated potassium and phosphorus levels, and decreased albumin level.
- Imaging studies reveal moderately large bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size since November 7th, likely compressive atelectasis at the bases, and no evidence of pancreatitis.
- The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications for her medical conditions.
- Potential medical complications include infection, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
- The patient's current plan includes further evaluation and management of her medical conditions, including consideration of hemodialysis, additional tests, and potential changes in medication regimen."

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (EF 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block who presented as out-of-hospital transfer with possible sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia.

The patient has several medical complications and potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient has fever of unknown origin (FUO) complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of a low ejection fraction (EF 20%). She has a history of Enterobacter sensitive to cefepime but was switched to imipenem at the out-of-hospital setting. Urine and blood cultures are negative. The chest X-ray is likely indicative of pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is not related to infection as she remains afebrile and no obvious source of infection is identified. There is concern for an oncologic source such as leukemia or lymphoma. Further investigation is needed, including a final read of the CT chest/abd/pel as a potential source of lymphadenopathy.

3. Altered/depressed mental status: The patient's mental status is altered/depressed, possibly due to toxic/metabolic factors of unknown origin. A three-digit BUN clearly plays"

The patient has a history of Enterobacter sensitive to [Last Name (un)] /cefepime. She was started on zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH. OSH urine culture (UCX), blood culture (BCX) data - no positive data. Chest X-ray (CXR) is not indicative of pneumonia (PNA), likely edema instead.
   - DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) negative, C. difficile (C. diff) negative x3, OSH line pulled tip pending. UCX negative here, BCX negative thus far.
   - Liver function tests (LFTs) normal, CT abdomen/pelvis (CT A/P) showed no infectious source.

   [**2-1**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with ?sepsis,
   atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.
   .
   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.   OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data -
   no positive data.  CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema
   instead.
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 3, OSH line pulled
 tip pending. UCX-
   Negative here, BCX
 negative thus far
   - LFTs normal, CT A/P showed no infectious source
   - on meropenem [**6-29**] day course given prior cx data and multiple drug
   allergies (following ID rec)
   - azithromycin d/ced, finished 5 day course
   - ID following; will discuss empirically starting PO vancomycin for C.
   diff seeing as no improvement thus far and strong past medical history
   of C. diff
   .
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  Stress dose steroids had
   been stopped several days ago and are unlikely source.  Concern for
   oncologic source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.
   - f/u final read of CT chest/abd/pel as source of lymphadenopathy
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - peripheral smear ordered; H/O consult
   .
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of unknown origin. 3-Digit BUN
   clearly playing a role, not retaining CO2
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] yesterday with no improvement
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   - HD for presumably symptomatic azotemia
   - send serum ammonia to assess hepatic vs. renal source for asterixis
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues.
   - started maintenance fluids, addl boluses as tolerated
   - azotemia persists despite hydration; renal feels that this remains
   [**1-25**] pre-renal insufficiency
   - Plan for HD line placement in AM
   - no renal findings on CT
   .
   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/c
d, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now near normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - holding coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   - continue statin, aspirin
   - Will start HD in AM, consider running negative if persistent O2 need
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin and statin, holding carvedilol until off of pressors
   - d/c asa wil clarify reason.
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence, (-) x4 though very few
   things given WBC counts of >25
   - Toxin B assay (send out) pending, has higher sensitivity
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.
   - d/ced stress dose steroids
   .
   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Has done well
   previously on sliding scale insulin without fixed dose regimen.
   - continue humalog SS ACHS

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Ongoing IV Flagyl for empirc treatment of C Difficile. Hematology
   consult re increasing leukocytosis, but likely reactive. No other
   potential source.  Other antibiotics stopped. Cardiac status remains
   stable.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2168-11-16**] 16:33 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (EF 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block with a biventricular pacemaker. She presented as out of hospital with suspected sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia.

The patient's medical history includes infection, complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of an ejection fraction of 20%. She was previously sensitive to Enterobacter/cefepime. The patient was started on zosyn and switched to imipenem at the out-of-hospital setting. Urine culture and blood culture data from the out-of-hospital setting showed no positive results. Chest X-ray is likely indicative of edema instead of pneumonia. The patient finished a 5-day course of azithromycin and a 10-day course of meropenem.

The patient was also diagnosed with leukocytosis, not related to infection as she remains afebrile and no obvious source of infection was found. Concern for an oncologic source, such as leukemia or lymphoma, is present. A peripheral smear has been ordered, and a hematology consultation has been requested. Hyperuricemia and elevated phosphate levels are also noted, which may suggest tumor lysis picture.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F w/ a h/o CHF (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no CAD from cath
   [**2-1**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with ?sepsis,
   atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.
   .
   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.   OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data -
   no positive data.  CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema
   instead.   Finished 5d course of azithromycin and 10d course of
   meropenem.
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 4, OSH line pulled
 tip pending. UCX-
   Negative here, BCX
 negative thus far
   - CT A/P showed no infectious source
   - per curbside GI, and ID, started IV flagyl empirically for C. diff
   .
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  Stress dose steroids had
   been stopped several days ago and are unlikely source.  Concern for
   oncologic source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.
   - CT chest/abd/pel: no pathologic LAD
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - peripheral smear ordered; H/O consult
   - f/u leukocyte alk phos
   .
   # relative thrombocytopenia
   -          [**Name2 (NI) **] since SC heparin 3 days ago.  D/C heparin,
   pneumoboots only for DVT ppx.
   -          Holding off on HIT Ab panel for now.  Will d/w Heme.
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of unknown origin. 3-Digit BUN
   clearly playing a role, not retaining CO2
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] yesterday with no improvement; serum
   ammonia WNL
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues (slowly improving).
   -          no renal findings on CT
   -          renal following; f/u recs
   -          no plans for HD at this time
   .
   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug-drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/ced, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now near normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - holding coumadin
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   -          continue statin, aspirin
   -          as patient now showing obvious signs of volume overload,
   consider diuresis to keep goal I+O even to neg 500 cc.
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin, statin, BB
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence, (-) x4 though very few
   things given WBC counts of >25
   - Toxin B assay (send out) pending, has higher sensitivity
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.  Received 3d of stress dose steroids
   (solumedrol) with no improvement in mental status, now back to home
   dose.
   .
   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Has done well
   previously on sliding scale insulin without fixed dose regimen.
   - continue humalog SS ACHS

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block with a bi-ventricular pacemaker. The patient presented with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including infection, leukocytosis, relative thrombocytopenia, altered/depressed mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR, rhythm disturbances, and cardiac issues.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient may be at risk for:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of enterobacter sensitive to cefepime but was switched to imipenem. There is ongoing concern for infection as evidenced by the continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics and cultures.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with unclear sepsis and has been treated with multiple antibiotics. There is a concern for ongoing infection and sepsis due to leukocytosis and other signs of systemic inflammation.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis not related to infection. This could be due to an oncologic source such as leukemia or lymphoma. Further evaluation is needed.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of infection and the presence of fever, leukocytosis, and positive findings on blood cultures suggest a possible ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by widespread inflammation in response to an infection.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1.3-1.5 and the current value of 2.6 indicate a decline in kidney function. This could be due to factors such as dehydration, use of nephrotoxic medications, or an underlying kidney disease. AKI can have serious consequences, including fluid and electrolyte imbalances, buildup of toxins, and acid-base disturbances.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level of 150 mEq/L is above the normal range, indicating hypernatremia. This condition occurs when there is an imbalance of water and sodium in the body. It can lead to symptoms such as confusion, weakness, seizures, and even coma if left untreated.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, and at one point it was low. Thrombocytopenia, or a low platelet count, can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.

5. Electrolyte imbalances:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD), and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who presented with possible sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia. The patient had an infection that was initially treated with azithromycin and meropenem, but no positive data from urine or blood cultures were found. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed no infectious source, and the patient was started on IV flagyl empirically for possible C. diff infection, as well as PO Vanc.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which is not related to an infection, and hyperuricemia and elevated phosphorus levels that may indicate tumor lysis syndrome. The patient's platelet count has been relatively low, and she has been on heparin sodium prophylaxis. The platelets are trending upward, and the patient is being followed for a possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient's sodium level is elevated, and she is being given free water flushes with tube feeds to address this issue. Her mental status has been altered and depressed, possibly due to toxic/metabolic causes or infectious delirium. She has shown mild steps forward in improvement.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a"

   [**2-1**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with ?sepsis,
   atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.
   .
   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.   OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data -
   no positive data.  CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema
   instead.   Finished 5d course of azithromycin and 10d course of
   meropenem.
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 4, OSH line pulled
 tip pending. UCX-
   Negative here, BCX
 negative thus far
   - CT A/P showed no infectious source
   - per ID, started IV flagyl empirically and PO VANC for C. diff
   .
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  Stress dose steroids had
   been stopped several days ago and are unlikely source.  Concern for
   oncologic source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.
   - CT chest/abd/pel: no pathologic LAD
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - peripheral smear ordered; H/O consult
   - f/u leukocyte alk phos
   .
   # relative thrombocytopenia
   -          [**Name2 (NI) **] since SC heparin 3 days ago.  D/C heparin,
   pneumoboots only for DVT ppx.
   -          Holding off on HIT Ab panel for now.  Will d/w Heme.
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of infectious delirium vs
   symptomatic uremia. 3-Digit BUN clearly playing a role, not retaining
   CO2.  Patient continues to make mild steps forward.
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] yesterday with no improvement; serum
   ammonia WNL
   - BUN continues to down trend
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues (slowly improving).
   -          no renal findings on CT
   -          renal following; f/u recs
   -          no plans for HD at this time
   .
   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug-drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/ced, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now near normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - holding coumadin
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   -          continue statin, aspirin
   -          as patient now showing obvious signs of volume overload,
   consider diuresis to keep goal I+O even to neg 500 cc.
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin, statin, BB
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence, (-) x4 though very few
   things given WBC counts of >25
   - Toxin B assay (send out) pending, has higher sensitivity
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.  Received 3d of stress dose steroids
   (solumedrol) with no improvement in mental status, now back to home
   dose.

   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Has done well
   previously on sliding scale insulin without fixed dose regimen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD), and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who presented with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia. She had been transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with fever, confusion, and hypotension. The patient's medical history includes chronic renal failure, chronic C. difficile infection, rheumatoid arthritis, type II diabetes mellitus (DMII), and hypothyroidism.

The patient was started on zosyn and then switched to imipenem for suspected infection, but no positive data was found in urine or blood cultures. A CT scan showed no infectious source, and the patient completed a 5-day course of azithromycin and a 10-day course of meropenem.

The patient also has leukocytosis without an obvious source, hyperuricemia, and elevated phosphate levels, which may indicate tumor lysis syndrome. A peripheral smear has been ordered, and a consultation with hematology is pending. The patient's platelet count is slightly low.

The patient has altered mental status likely due to toxic/metabolic delirium or symptomatic uremia. A head CT scan was normal, and lactulose did not improve her condition. The patient's BUN level is"

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   No change from yesterday except slight continued downward trend in
   WBC.  Will increase free water today for hypernatremia. Continued
   therapy for presumed CDiff.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, and no history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She presents with suspected sepsis, atrial fibrillation, and demand ischemia. The patient has been hospitalized for several days and has received multiple antibiotics, including zosyn, imipenem, and vancomycin. Her current medications include furosemide (Lasix), flagyl, and various vitamins and minerals.

The patient has leukocytosis, which is not related to an infection, and her WBC count is trending down. She also has hypernatremia, relative thrombocytopenia, altered/depressed mental status, and renal failure. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic due to drug-drug interactions and liver dysfunction. Her rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rate control, and she has a history of CHF with a reduced ejection fraction of 20-30%. The patient has a soft palate lesion that may interfere with her airway.

The patient's current vitals include a temperature of 37.7°C, blood pressure of 116/50 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. Her CVP is 8 mmHg, total fluid input is 2,335 mL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, and no known coronary artery disease who presented with possible sepsis, atrial fibrillation, and right ventricular overload. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including infection, leukocytosis, relative thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, soft palate lesion, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR, and rhythm disturbances. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with possible sepsis, and there is ongoing concern for infection as evidenced by the ongoing cultures and antibiotics being administered.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell counts, which may indicate an ongoing inflammatory response or demargination due to stress dose steroids.
3. Relative Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or another cause. Heparin has been discontinued, and the patient is being monitored.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to dehydration or excessive sodium intake. Fluid management is important in this case.
5. Soft Palate Lesion: The patient has a lesion on the soft palate that may"

   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.   OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data -
   no positive data.  CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema
   instead.   Finished 5d course of azithromycin and 10d course of
   meropenem.
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 4, OSH line pulled

   - CT A/P showed no infectious source
   - per ID, started IV flagyl empirically and PO VANC for C. diff
   .
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  Stress dose steroids had
   been stopped several days ago and are unlikely source.  Concern for
   oncologic source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.  Now downtrending WBC.
   - CT chest/abd/pel: no pathologic LAD
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - per H/O, unlikely to be [**1-25**] myeloproliferative disorder in setting of

   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of infectious delirium vs
   symptomatic uremia. 3-Digit BUN clearly playing a role, not retaining
   CO2.  Patient continues to make mild steps forward.
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] yesterday with no improvement; serum
   ammonia WNL
   - BUN continues to down trend
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage

   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues (slowly improving).
   -          no renal findings on CT
   -          renal following; f/u recs
   -          no plans for HD at this time

   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug-drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/ced, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now near normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB

   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD), and left bundle branch block (LBBB) with a pacemaker. The patient presents with possible sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including infection (FUO), leukemia or lymphoma (leukocytosis), relative thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, altered/depressed mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR, rhythm disturbances (afib), and pump dysfunction (BiV).

The patient has undergone multiple interventions and treatments including antibiotic therapy for suspected infections, fluid management for fluid overload and hypovolemia, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, diuretics for CHF, and other medications for various conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions and interventions include worsening heart failure, septic shock, development of further infections, electrolyte imbalances, kidney dysfunction, bleeding or clotting disorders, and mental status changes.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, renal function, electrolyte levels, and mental status. Frequent reassessment and adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary to prevent and manage any potential complications."

   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.   OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data -
   no positive data.  CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema
   instead.   Finished 5d course of azithromycin and 10d course of
   meropenem.
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 4, OSH line pulled

   - CT A/P showed no infectious source
   - per ID, started IV flagyl empirically and PO VANC for C. diff
   .
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  ?Demargination after
   stress dose steroids several days ago.  Low concern for oncologic
   source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.  Now downtrending WBC.
   - CT chest/abd/pel: no pathologic LAD
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - per H/O, unlikely to be [**1-25**] myeloproliferative disorder in setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # relative thrombocytopenia
   -          [**Name2 (NI) **] since SC heparin 3 days ago.  D/C heparin,
   pneumoboots only for DVT ppx. (Had Doppler today (-))
   -          HIT (-)
   -          trend platelets, currently stable
   # hypernatremia

   interfering with airway.
   -          f/u ENT recs
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of infectious delirium vs
   symptomatic uremia. 3-Digit BUN clearly playing a role, not retaining
   CO2.  Patient continues to make mild steps forward.
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] with no improvement; serum ammonia WNL
   - BUN continues to down trend
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   - Will discuss role for stimulants in her
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues (slowly improving).
   -          no renal findings on CT
   -          renal following; f/u recs
   -          no plans for HD at this time
   .
   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug-drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/ced, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now near normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   - restarted heparin and coumadin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - Coumadin restarted with bridge
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   -          continue statin, aspirin
   -          as patient now showing obvious signs of volume overload,
   consider diuresis to keep goal I+O even to neg 500 cc.
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin, statin, BB
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence, (-) x4 though very few
   things given WBC counts of >25
   - Toxin B assay (send out) pending, has higher sensitivity
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.  Received 3d of stress dose steroids
   (solumedrol) with no improvement in mental status, now back to home
   dose.
   .
   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Recent FS >200s,
   also on D5W for hypernatremia

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and left bundle branch block with a permanent pacemaker. She presented as an out-of-hospital transfer with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. The patient has multiple medical complications and comorbidities, including infection, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, soft palate lesion, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR, and rhythm disturbances.

Infection:
The patient has been diagnosed with an infection, likely enterobacter species sensitive to cefepime. She was initially started on zosyn and then switched to imipenem at the outside hospital. Urine and blood cultures have been negative, and a CT scan showed no infectious source. The patient has completed a 5-day course of azithromycin and a 10-day course of meropenem. DFA and UCX tests were negative, indicating no evidence of infection.

Leukocytosis:
The patient exhibits leukocytosis, which is not related to infection since she remains afebrile and no obvious source of infection has been identified. This may be due to demargination after stress dose steroids several days ago. Low concern for an oncologic source such as leukemia or lymphoma."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, and no history of coronary artery disease. She presented to the hospital with a possible diagnosis of sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem and imipenem, but no positive blood or urine cultures were found. She also has leukocytosis, hyperuricemia, and elevated phosphate levels, which could be indicative of tumor lysis syndrome. The patient has been treated with stress dose steroids, which did not improve her mental status. She has hypernatremia and relative thrombocytopenia, possibly due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient's mental status is still depressed, and she requires ongoing care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of fever of unknown origin (FUO) and complicated atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response suggests a possible ongoing infection. The negative urine and blood cultures indicate that the source of infection may not have been identified yet.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels require careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's relative thrombocytopenia, possibly due to heparin-induced thrombocytopen"

   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.   OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data -
   no positive data.  CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema
   instead.   Finished 5d course of azithromycin and 10d course of
   meropenem.
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 4, OSH line pulled
 tip pending. UCX-
   Negative here, BCX
 negative thus far
   - CT A/P showed no infectious source
   - per ID, started IV flagyl empirically and PO VANC for C. diff
   .
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  ?Demargination after
   stress dose steroids several days ago.  Low concern for oncologic
   source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.  Now downtrending WBC.
   - CT chest/abd/pel: no pathologic LAD
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - per H/O, unlikely to be [**1-25**] myeloproliferative disorder in setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # relative thrombocytopenia
   -          [**Name2 (NI) **] since SC heparin 3 days ago.  D/C heparin,
   pneumoboots only for DVT ppx. (Had Doppler today (-))
   -          HIT (-)
   -          trend platelets, currently stable
   # hypernatremia
 Na 147 this AM.
   -          increase free water flushes (250) with tube feeds

   # Soft palate lesion
 Pt noted to have lesion on soft palate, may be
   interfering with airway.
   -          f/u ENT recs
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of infectious delirium vs
   symptomatic uremia. 3-Digit BUN clearly playing a role, not retaining
   CO2.  Patient continues to make mild steps forward.
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] with no improvement; serum ammonia WNL
   - BUN continues to down trend
   - no appreciable response to stress dose steroids x 2d, will d/c [**11-12**]
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage
   - Will discuss role for stimulants in her
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  Cr has improved with hydration but azotemia
   continues (slowly improving).
   -          no renal findings on CT
   -          renal following; f/u recs
   -          no plans for HD at this time
   .
   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug-drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/ced, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now near normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   - restarted heparin and coumadin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - Coumadin restarted with bridge
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   -          continue statin, aspirin
   -          as patient now showing obvious signs of volume overload,
   consider diuresis to keep goal I+O even to neg 500 cc.
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin, statin, BB
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence, (-) x4 though very few
   things given WBC counts of >25
   - Toxin B assay (send out) pending, has higher sensitivity
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.  Received 3d of stress dose steroids
   (solumedrol) with no improvement in mental status, now back to home
   dose.
   .
   # DMII - Managed with lifestyle modification at home. Recent FS >200s,
   also on D5W for hypernatremia

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) with a biventricular pacemaker (BiV pacer). The patient presented with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia.

2. The patient has been treated for infection, including a five-day course of azithromycin and a ten-day course of meropenem. However, the urine culture and blood cultures were negative. A CT scan showed no infectious source, and the patient's fever of unknown origin (FUO) is complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR in the setting of an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient has completed a course of IV Flagyl empirically and PO VANC for Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

3. The patient also has leukocytosis, which is not related to infection as the patient remains afebrile and no obvious source of infection has been found. There is a concern for demargination after stress dose steroids several days ago. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is now downtrending. A CT chest/abdom"

The patient has negative urine and blood cultures, and the chest X-ray is not indicative of pneumonia.

   79 yo F w/ a h/o CHF (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no CAD from cath
   [**2-1**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with ?sepsis,
   atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.
   .
   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.   OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data -
   no positive data.  CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema
   instead.   Finished 5d course of azithromycin and 10d course of
   meropenem. Treating for presumed Cdiff.
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 5, OSH line pulled
 tip negative. UCX-
   Negative here, BCX
 negative thus far
   - CT A/P showed no infectious source
   - per ID, started IV flagyl empirically and PO [**Last Name (un) **] (day 1 = [**11-16**]) for
   C. diff; continue minimum 14 days, ?taper - TBD
   - Cdiff toxin assay pending
   .
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  ?Demargination after
   stress dose steroids several days ago.  Low concern for oncologic
   source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.  WBC peaked at 42. Now WBC ~20s.
   Likely [**1-25**] to presumed Cdiff.
   - CT chest/abd/pel: no pathologic LAD
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - per H/O, unlikely to be [**1-25**] myeloproliferative disorder in setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # relative thrombocytopenia
   -          Had Doppler today (-).
   -          HIT (-)
   -          trend platelets, stable at 106.
   -          Continue to watch, if acute bleed xfuse plts, ?stop flagyl
   -          On IV heparin bridge to warfarin
   # hypernatremia
 Na 139 this AM.

   # Soft palate lesion
 Pt noted to have lesion on soft palate, may be
   interfering with airway. Dried mucous removed by ENT
   -          f/u with ENT as outpatient for discoloration on hard palate
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of infectious delirium vs
   symptomatic uremia. BUN continuing to improve. MS continuing to improve
   as well
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] with no improvement; serum ammonia WNL
   - BUN continues to down trend
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage, no stimulants at this time and
   continue to monitor
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  BUN/Cr have improved with hydration.
   -          no renal findings on CT
   -          renal following; f/u recs
   -          no plans for HD at this time
   .
   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug-drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/ced, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now near normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   - restarted heparin and coumadin [**11-19**]
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - Coumadin restarted with bridge
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   -          continue statin, aspirin
   -          as patient now showing obvious signs of volume overload,
   consider diuresis to keep goal I+O even to neg 500 cc.
   -          restarted ACE-I [**11-20**]
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin, statin, BB

   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence, (-) x5. Treating
   empirically with IV Flagyl and PO [**Name (NI) 6150**]
 pt is improving.
   - Toxin B assay (send out) pending, has higher sensitivity

   OSH on day of transfer.  Received 3d of stress dose steroids
   (solumedrol) with no improvement in mental status, now back to home
   dose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease, and a pacemaker for left bundle branch block. She presents with unknown sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. The patient has been treated for presumed Clostridium difficile infection, which has been negative multiple times. She has leukocytosis, relative thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR, atrial fibrillation, and a soft palate lesion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been treated for presumed C. difficile infection, but with negative results. She may still be at risk for other infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has relative thrombocytopenia, which could be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions. Platelet transfusion may be considered if bleeding occurs.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires careful management of fluid balance to prevent complications such as dehydration or fluid overload.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD), and a left bundle branch block (LBBB) who presented to the emergency department with acute onset shortness of breath. She was initially diagnosed with sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues including infection, leukocytosis, relative thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, leg edema, soft palate lesion, altered/depressed mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR, and rhythm disturbances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been treated for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, but further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis. She also had negative urine and blood cultures, suggesting no current evidence of bacterial infection.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count, which initially raised concerns for an oncologic source such as leukemia or lymphoma. However, the count has now stabilized in the 20s, and it is more likely related to stress-induced demargination or presumed C. diff.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo F w/ a h/o CHF (EF of 20-30%), carotid stenosis, no CAD from cath
   [**2-1**], and h/o LBBB s/p BiV pacer presents as OSH transfer with ?sepsis,
   atrial fibrillation w/ RVR and demand ischemia.
   .
   # Infection: FUO, Complicated by Afib w/ RVR in setting of EF 20%. Pt
   with history of enterobactor sensitive to [**Last Name (un) **]/cefepime. Was started on
   zosyn and switched to imipenem at OSH.   OSH Urine cx, blood Cx data -
   no positive data.  CXR probably not indicative of PNA, likely edema
   instead.   Finished 5d course of azithromycin and 10d course of
   meropenem. Treating for presumed Cdiff.
   - DFA
 Neg, C.Diff- Negative x 5, OSH line pulled
 tip negative. UCX-
   Negative here, BCX
 negative thus far
   - CT A/P showed no infectious source
   - per ID, started IV flagyl empirically and PO [**Last Name (un) **] (day 1 = [**11-16**]) for
   C. diff; continue minimum 14 days, ?taper/pulse - TBD
   - Cdiff toxin assay negative
   - no further w/u necessary at this time, d/c lines and foley ASAP and
   transfer out of ICU prn; if pt spikes, consider tapping pleural
   effusions, LP to evaluate CSF, CT sinus not recommended at this point
   - f/u wound Cx from decub
   .
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  ?Demargination after
   stress dose steroids several days ago.  Low concern for oncologic
   source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.  WBC peaked at 42. Now WBC ~20s.
   Likely [**1-25**] to presumed Cdiff.
   - CT chest/abd/pel: no pathologic LAD
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - per H/O, unlikely to be [**1-25**] myeloproliferative disorder in setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # relative thrombocytopenia
   -          Had Doppler  (-).
   -          HIT (-)
   -          trend platelets, stable at 106.
   -          Continue to watch, if acute bleed xfuse plts, ?stop flagyl
   -          On IV heparin bridge to warfarin
   # hypernatremia
 Na 139 this AM.
   -          Decrease flushes to 150cc
   -          f/u nutrition recs
 on Fibersource HN (lower Na
   concentration than Renal TF)
   # LE edema
 Likely [**1-25**] to CHF, fluid overload. B/L LENIs negative for
   DVTs. Continue diuresis.
   # Soft palate lesion
 Pt noted to have lesion on soft palate, may be
   interfering with airway. Dried mucous removed by ENT
   -          f/u with ENT as outpatient for discoloration on hard palate
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of infectious delirium vs
   symptomatic uremia. BUN continuing to improve. MS continuing to improve
   as well
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] with no improvement; serum ammonia WNL
   - BUN continues to down trend
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage, no stimulants at this time and
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  BUN/Cr have improved with hydration.
   -          no renal findings on CT
   -          renal following; f/u recs
   -          no plans for HD at this time
   .
   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug-drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/ced, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - now near normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   - restarted heparin and coumadin [**11-19**]
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - Coumadin restarted with bridge
   .
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   -          continue statin, aspirin
   -          as patient now showing obvious signs of volume overload,
   consider diuresis to keep goal I+O neg 500 cc.
   -          restarted ACE-I [**11-20**]
   .
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.
   - aspirin, statin, BB, captopril
   .
   # Chronic C. Diff: No evidence of recurrence, (-) x5. Treating
   empirically with IV Flagyl and PO [**Name (NI) 6150**]
 pt is improving.
   - Toxin B assay (send out) pending, has higher sensitivity
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid dose
   .
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis: Chronic 5mg prednisone steroid use, although
   not completely clear most recent use. No evidence of adrenal
   insufficency from this low dose. Did receive hydrocort 100mg IV x1 at
   OSH on day of transfer.  Received 3d of stress dose steroids
   (solumedrol) with no improvement in mental status, now back to home
   dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, and left bundle branch block who presented with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation, and demand ischemia. She has been in the ICU since [**2168-11-17**] and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including suspected Clostridium difficile infection, leukocytosis likely due to presumed C. diff, relative thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, leg edema likely due to CHF and fluid overload, soft palate lesion, altered/depressed mental status possibly due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy or uremia, acute on chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure with poor forward flow.

The patient has been treated with various medications including heparin, warfarin, flagyl, imipenem, zosyn, cefepime, azithromycin, meropenem, lasix, and fiber source HN tube feeds. She has also received stress dose steroids and has been on a bi-ventricular pacemaker since [**8-31**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been treated for suspected sepsis and C. difficile infection. There is ongoing concern for infection as evidenced by the negative urine and blood cultures."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   To continue course of possible C Difficle despite negative toxin
   assays. Cardiac status stable.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2168-11-21**] 19:00 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD) from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block (LBBB) with a biventricular pacemaker. The patient presents with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia.

The patient's current conditions include infection with a negative urine and blood culture, likely edema instead of pneumonia on chest X-ray, and a possible diagnosis of Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient has completed a 5-day course of azithromycin and a 10-day course of meropenem. Empirical treatment for C. diff with intravenous (IV) flagyl and oral [**Last Name (un)**] is being continued for a minimum of 14 days, with consideration for tapering or pulsing therapy. The patient's C. diff toxin assay is negative.

The patient also exhibits leukocytosis, which peaked at 42 and is now in the 20s. This could be due to demargination after stress dose steroids several days ago or presumed C. diff. A computed tomography (CT) chest/abdomen/pelvis showed no pathologic lymphadenopathy.

The patient's platelet count is relative thrombocytopenia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease (CAD), and a pacemaker for left bundle branch block (LBBB). She presented to the hospital with unclear sepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia. The patient has been treated for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which was negative on five occasions. She also had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and was given antibiotics, but no positive data was found in urine or blood cultures. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia but indicated edema. The patient underwent a CT abdomen/pelvis, which showed no pathologic lymphadenopathy.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Infection: The patient had fever of unknown origin (FUO) with atrial fibrillation and RVR in the setting of ejection fraction (EF) 20%. She was treated for presumed C. diff infection, but all tests were negative. She is being treated empirically for C. diff with intravenous (IV) flagyl and oral [Last Name (un)] for a minimum of 14 days, possibly tapering. The C. diff toxin assay is pending.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count peaked at 42 and is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), carotid stenosis, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, atrial fibrillation, and demand ischemia. She has altered mental status and an elevated white blood cell count, of uncertain etiology after extensive workup. The patient has multiple medical complications including infection/leukocytosis, hypothermia, stage III decub wound, relative thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, lower extremity edema, soft palate lesion, altered/depressed mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, subtherapeutic INR, rhythm disturbances, and pump dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection/Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. The presence of sepsis and the treatment for presumed C. difficile infection suggest ongoing infection concerns.

2. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is low, which can be caused by various factors such as medication, decreased metabolism, or exposure to cold environments. Hypothermia can lead to slowed metabolic processes and organ dysfunction.

3. Stage III Decub Wound: The patient has a pressure ulcer, specifically a stage III decub wound, which is a deep tissue injury caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. This can lead to serious complications if not"

   - f/u wound Cx from decub
   # leukocytosis: Not in relation to infection as patient remains
   afebrile and no obvious source of infection.  ?Demargination after
   stress dose steroids several days ago.  Low concern for oncologic
   source i.e. leukemia vs. lymphoma.  WBC peaked at 42. Now WBC ~20s.
   Likely [**1-25**] to presumed Cdiff.
   - CT chest/abd/pel: no pathologic LAD
   - noted to have hyperuricemia on lab workup, as well as elevation in
   Phos, K following stress dose steroids earlier in hospitalization;
   therefore, concern that this could be a tumor lysis picture
   - per H/O, unlikely to be [**1-25**] myeloproliferative disorder in setting of

 Pt noted to have lesion on soft palate, may be
   interfering with airway. Dried mucous removed by ENT
   -          f/u with ENT as outpatient for discoloration on hard palate
   # Altered/Depressed MS
 Toxic/Metabolic of infectious delirium vs
   symptomatic uremia. BUN continuing to improve. MS continuing to improve
   as well
   - head CT -> WNL
   - lactulose was tried [**11-10**] with no improvement; serum ammonia WNL
   - BUN continues to down trend
   - TSH WNL; fT4, T3 slightly low but doubtful to be responsible for this
   clinical picture
   - NEURO: agrees with current workup and treatment plan, consider LP if
   patient spikes through abx coverage, no stimulants at this time and
   continue to monitor.
   -- Recommends EEG to confirm toxic metabolic encephatlopathy.
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Baseline 1.3-1.5, creatinine 2.6 on
   presentation to OSH.  BUN/Cr have improved with hydration.  Creatinine
   1.1 today.

   -          renal following; f/u recs
   -          no plans for HD at this time
   # supratherapeutic INR: likely due to drug-drug interaction (amio vs.
   flagyl vs abx), liver dysfunction, inhibitor screen.
   - amio d/ced, inhibitor screen-wnl
   - normalized s/p d/c of amio + Vit K
   - restarted heparin and coumadin [**11-19**], INR 1.4 today.
   # RHYTHM:  Afib, now rate controlled - likely worsened by underlying
   sepsis.  Had been anticoagulated with therapeutic INR since admission
   at OSH.
   - initially treated with amio, but now d/ced [**1-25**] interaction with
   warfarin/contribution to AMS
   - continue rate control with BB
   - Coumadin restarted with bridge
   # PUMP: s/p BiV placement [**8-31**]. Reports using lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] at home
   although no record from OSH. Euvolemic on admission.  Picture clouded
   currently-  Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hyptoentsion suggest hypovolemia.  CHF with
   poor forward flow would explain both.
   -          continue statin, aspirin
   -          as patient now showing obvious signs of volume overload,
   consider diuresis to keep goal I+O neg 500 cc.
   -          restarted ACE-I [**11-20**]
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD as per cath [**2-1**]. Likely demand ischemia in
   setting of sepsis/infection compounded by acute on chronic renal
   failure.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, carotid stenosis, no coronary artery disease from catheterization, and a history of left bundle branch block (LBBB) status post biventricular pacemaker placement. The patient presented initially with urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and demand ischemia. 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status and elevated white blood cell count of uncertain etiology after extensive workup. The patient has been treated for presumed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which has been negative on multiple occasions. Other potential complications include leukocytosis, impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, left leg edema likely due to CHF and fluid overload, soft palate lesion, depressed mental status possibly due to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy or uremia, acute-on-chronic renal failure, supratherapeutic INR likely due to drug-drug interactions and liver dysfunction, and rhythm disturbances due to atrial fibrillation. The patient also has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease."

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, carotid stenosis, and no known coronary artery disease from catheterization. She was initially admitted with urosepsis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and demand ischemia. The patient's current condition is altered mental status and an elevated white blood cell count, with an uncertain etiology after extensive workup.

The patient has been treated for presumed Clostridium difficile infection but tested negative for the toxin B assay. She has also been receiving IV Flagyl empirically and PO [**Last Name (un) **] for C. diff; continuing minimum 14 days, possibly tapering or pulsing - to be determined. The patient's Cdiff toxin assay is negative, and her abdomen is soft and nontender without rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.1 C (97%)
- Tcurrent: 35.3 C (95.5%)
- Heart rate: 78 bpm (67-81)
- Blood pressure: 108/44 mmHg (57-120/34-56)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (12-24)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on face tent

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a chief complaint of mental status changes, elevated white count, and diarrhea. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, airway issues with an inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, altered mental status (not delirium), and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for sepsis without organ dysfunction, AFIB, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has an inability to protect her airway, which increases the risk of aspiration and subsequent respiratory complications such as pneumonia.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of AFIB, which can lead to irregular heart rhythms and potential cardiac arrhythmias. This increases the risk of complications such as stroke or heart failure.

3. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and is being treated for sepsis without organ dysfunction. This suggests an ongoing infection, which could potentially lead to further complications such as septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

4. Renal Complications: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to complications such as electroly"

   currently-  Pulmonary exam and O2 dependance suggest fluid overload,
   pre-renal azotemia and mild hypotention.   CHF with poor forward flow
   would explain both.
   -          continue statin, aspirin, aceI
   -          as patient now showing obvious signs of volume overload,
   consider diuresis to keep goal I+O -500cc

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   79 year old with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20%, s/p biventricular
   pacer [**8-31**], PAF and DM transferred for hypotension and urosepsis, AF
   with RVR and NSTEMI. Patient developed a toxic metabolic encephalopathy
   which has since resolved. The patient's mental status is back to
   baseline. Patient had c dif toxin negative diarrhea which is responding
   to weaning doses of PO vancomycin.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - course breath sounds bilaterally
   heart - soft [**Hospital **]
   Medical Decision Making
   79 year old with prolonged hospital course primarily due to mental
   status changes now back to baseline. Diarrhea is resolving on PO Vanco.
   Will screen patient for rehab and continue coumadin for A fib. Continue
   CHF regimen with captopril, lasix and metoprolol. Maintain INR of [**1-26**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, who presented with hypotension and urosepsis. She was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and NSTEMI. The patient developed toxic metabolic encephalopathy, which has since resolved, and her mental status is back to baseline. She had C. diff toxin-negative diarrhea, which is responding to weaning doses of PO vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is showing improvement in her condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 20-30%. Her current presentation includes symptoms such as fluid overload, pre-renal azotemia, and hypotension, which are consistent with CHF exacerbation. Monitoring fluid balance and diuresis will be important in managing this condition.
2. Infection/Leukocytosis: The patient had a history of enterobactor infection sensitive to cefepime. She was treated with azithromycin and meropenem, but no positive data from urine or blood cultures were found. It is crucial to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
3. C. diff colitis: The patient was treated for presumed C. diff infection. She is currently improving, and her toxin B assay is negative."
