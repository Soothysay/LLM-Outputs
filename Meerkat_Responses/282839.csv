","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with substernal chest pain rated at 10/10 intensity. The patient underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting of the left circumflex artery (LCX) with a 3.5x15mm Xience stent. He was transferred to the coronary critical care unit (CCU) due to persistent chest pain after cardiac catheterization.

The patient has a diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and coronary artery disease (CAD) involving three major coronary arteries: the left main coronary artery (LMCA), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and right coronary artery (RCA). The LAD has mid-vessel 60% stenosis, LCx has proximal eccentric 80% stenosis with mild luminal irregularities, and RCA has proximal 60% focal and distal 60% mild luminal irregularities.

The patient is currently on several medications including atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily, clopidogrel (Plavix), aspirin, and IV heparin. The blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits. Oxygen delivery is via a nasal cannula, and the patient's SpO2 is 98%. The respiratory support includes ABG analysis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia. He presented with severe substernal chest pain and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with successful stenting of the left circumflex artery (LCX). The patient's chest pain persisted after the procedure, leading to his transfer to the cardiac care unit (CCU).

The patient has been diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and coronary artery disease (CAD). His coronary angiography revealed significant blockages in multiple arteries, including the left main coronary artery (LMCA), left anterior descending artery (LAD), LCX, and right coronary artery (RCA). The patient underwent stenting of the LCX but still experiences ongoing chest pain.

The plan is to perform repeat angiography in the morning to assess the response to the recent intervention. The patient will continue on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as statin therapy with atorvastatin. Beta-blocker therapy will be uptitrated as tolerated, and intravenous heparin will be continued. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate will be closely monitored, and an echocardiogram will be obtained today.

Additionally, the patient has a history of type II diabetes, for which oral hyp"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with severe substernal chest pain. He underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting of the left circumflex artery (LCX) with a 3.5x15mm Xience stent. However, he still experienced persistent chest pain after the procedure, leading to a repeat cardiac catheterization. During the repeat cath, the patient experienced a code blue and was found to have increased luminal stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was subsequently stented.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/54 to 171/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and he has trace edema in both lower extremities. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 237 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, blood glucose level of 243 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, sodium level of 134 mEq/L, chloride level of 98 mEq/L, magnesium"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with substernal chest pain and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting of the left circumflex artery (LCX). Due to persistent chest pain, he underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization, during which he experienced a code blue and was found to have increased stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was stented. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with three-vessel involvement and left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease. He also has a history of colon cancer.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing chest discomfort, tenderness over cath sites bilaterally, and a hematoma at the cath site. His vital signs are stable, but he has experienced episodes of bradycardia and apnea. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, likely due to multiple cardiac catheterizations and a contrast CT scan. His hemoglobin level is decreasing, and he has been transfused with packed red blood cells. His diabetes is being managed with insulin, and his hypertension is being managed with medication hold for renal protection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates renal impairment, which may be a result of multiple cardiac catheterizations and contrast exposure. Renal function should be closely monitored, and nephrotoxins should be avoided.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, indicating anemia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary, and transfusion may be required if the level falls below 25 g/dL.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia, which may be related to the use of beta-blockers. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of bradycardia, and the beta-blocker dosage may need to be adjusted.
4. Pulmonary nodules: The patient has pulmonary nodules identified on the CT scan, which are concerning, especially in the context of his history of colon cancer. Follow-up imaging is recommended.
5. Diabetic complications: The patient's diabetes should be closely monitored, and glycemic control should be maintained. The patient is at risk for diabetic complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's impaired renal function may be due to contrast-induced nephropathy. Measures to prevent further renal injury should be implemented, such as adequate hydration and the use of contrast agents with lower nephrotoxicity."

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with substernal chest pain. He underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting of the left circumflex artery (LCX) with a 3.5x15mm Xience stent. However, he experienced persistent chest pain after the procedure, leading to a repeat cardiac catheterization. During the repeat catheterization, the patient had a code blue on the table and was found to have increased left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis, which was stented.

The patient's current medications include clopidogrel (Plavix), aspirin 325mg PO daily, and atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily for now for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). His lipid panel shows that his cholesterol is at goal, triglycerides are 209, HDL is 32, and LDL is 45. His hemoglobin A1c is pending for risk stratification.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 58 bpm (normal range: 45-78 bpm), blood pressure of 115/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (normal range: 13-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with substernal chest pain and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting of the left circumflex artery. The patient then experienced persistent chest pain and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization, where a 90% occlusion in the left anterior descending artery was found and a drug-eluting stent was placed.

The patient has been diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and coronary artery disease (CAD), involving the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and right coronary artery. He is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin for ACS. His HbA1c level is elevated at 9.7, indicating the need to improve glycemic control.

The patient also has bilateral hematomas in the groin with a pseudoaneurysm on the left side. He received two units of blood transfusion, but his hematocrit level did not improve appropriately. A non-contrast CT scan of the pelvis was performed to further evaluate the hematomas, as they have expanded beyond the margins.

The patient's cardiac catheterization showed preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, consistent with hypertensive heart disease. However, the patient's serum creatinine has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 27-inch tall individual with unknown weight, admitted to the ICU for acute management. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, obstructive sleep apnea, anemia, and acute myocardial infarction. Upon admission, the patient presented with hematomas in both groins and a pseudoaneurysm in the left groin. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction greater than 65%, consistent with hypertensive heart disease. The patient was started on Lantus insulin at a dose of 10 units per day. The patient's critical care physician noted a platelet count of 196 K/uL and decided to transfuse one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to acute blood loss and hematoma. Despite the transfusion, the patient's platelet count remained stable at 24.3%. The patient received an additional unit of pRBCs in the morning after 6:30 AM. No known drug allergies were reported. Other medications administered in the ICU include infusions and unspecified other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/46-147/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%."

- The patient is a 73-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
- He presented with chest pain and underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting of the left circumflex artery (LCX).
- He was transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) due to persistent chest pain after the procedure.
- A repeat cardiac catheterization revealed occlusion in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was also stented.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with three-vessel disease and left main coronary artery (LMCA) no apparent CAD.
- His lipid panel is at goal, but his HbA1c is pending for risk stratification.
- The patient experienced bradycardia, which required lowering the dosage of beta-blockers.
- He has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 1.6, likely secondary to multiple cardiac catheterizations and contrast administration during a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest.
- The patient's hemoglobin (HCT) is trending downwards, possibly due to volume loss and bilateral groin hematomas resulting from the catheterization procedures.
- His blood pressure is being managed with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but lisinopril is being held for renal protection, and H"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with substernal chest pain and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting of the left circumflex artery (LCX). 

The patient was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) due to persistent chest pain after cardiac catheterization. During a repeat catheterization, the patient experienced a code blue on the table, and it was found that the left anterior descending artery (LAD) had significant stenosis, which was also stented.

The patient has a diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with three-vessel disease. He is currently on Plavix, aspirin, and atorvastatin for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the bradycardia range (44-72 bpm) and blood pressure within normal limits. He is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula and has a saturation level of 93%. The physical examination reveals two large hematomas in the bilateral groins, which have not expanded beyond drawn black lines. The extremities show trace edema on both sides.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and potassium (K+), as well as decreased hemoglobin (H"

- The patient has bilateral hematomas in the groin and a pseudoaneurysm on the left side, which were discovered through an ultrasound.
- Despite receiving two units of blood, there was no significant improvement in hematocrit levels.
- A non-contrast pelvis CT scan revealed that the hematoma has expanded outside of the margins.
- The patient's cardiac catheterization showed normal systolic function with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
- His electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated nonspecific ST-T changes, and telemetry monitoring revealed short runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and ventricular bigeminy.
- The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.8, which is likely secondary to multiple cardiac catheterizations and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented with substernal chest pain and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting of the left circumflex artery (LCX). The patient then transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) due to persistent chest pain. On the following day, he underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with code blue on the table. It was found that he had significant stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was stented using a drug-eluting stent (DES).

The patient has a history of triple vessel disease with no apparent coronary artery disease in the left main coronary artery (LMCA). His lipid panel on admission demonstrated cholesterol levels at goal. He is currently on Plavix, aspirin, and atorvastatin for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The patient also has bilateral hematomas in the groins, with a pseudoaneurysm on the left side. Despite receiving two units of blood, there was no appropriate increase in hematocrit. A CT scan is recommended for further evaluation as the hematoma has expanded outside of the margins.

The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is >65%, consistent with hypertensive heart disease. He has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular"
