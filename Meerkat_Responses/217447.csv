   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for upper extremity gangrene,
   underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by
   perioperative MI, was transferred to medicine for ascites and
   bradycardia, and is now transferred to MICU for management of
   hypotension and question sepsis.
   He was admitted to the vascular surgery service on [**2111-1-7**] for chronic
   bilateral finger infections and ischemic digits. He underwent bilateral
   upper extremity angiogram on [**2111-1-8**] and then left brachial to radial
   bypass w/ NR basilic vein on [**2111-1-12**]. His hospital course has been
   complicated by asystolic cardiac arrest peri-op and a 4L paracentesis
   on [**2111-1-13**] when he developed bradycardia, hypotension, demand cardic
   ischemia, and unresponsivness that required intubation and pressors.
   .
   Of note, he has developed new ascites after having been told that he
   ""cleared"" his Hep C years ago after tx with ribaviron/interferon in
   [**2101**] at [**Hospital1 12**]. Noted to have a significant alcohol history as well, but
   quit drinking approximately 21 years ago. Abdominal distension has been
   progressive over the last month. Had tap on [**1-13**] negative for SBP;
   cytology not sent. RUQ US on [**2111-1-20**] showed evidence of cirrhosis and
   hypoechoic lesion concerning for HCC.
   .
   He is being followed by multiple services including vascular surgery,
   plastic surgery (for finger wounds), cardiology (s/p cardiac arrest x
   3, feel he has had demand ischemia; symptomatic bradycardia ),
   nephrology (MWF HD patient), and hepatology (for ascites & new liver
   mass).
   .
   He was transferred to medicine on [**2111-1-21**].  In the two days prior to
   admission to the MICU, he was noted to have increased oxygen
   requirement (95% on 5L from 2L previously) and SBPs dropping from the
   100s -> 80s.  He underwent a diagnosis para on the day of transfer
   after receiving albumin 50g (initially planned for therapeutic tap
   given increased abdominal distention); the tap was consistent with SBP
   and he was started on ceftriaxone.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and question sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   leukocytosis, and periotneal cavity as likely source.  Positive for SBP
   on tap on [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  Other sources of infection include
   pneumonia (productive sputum), lines (R subclav, L subclav HD), skins
   (cellulitis around graft site), and UTI (purulent material drained
   after foley placement).  Decreased venous return may also be
   contributing given ascites.  Dressings for lines last changed on [**2111-1-17**]
   (triple lumen) and [**2111-1-21**] (HD).
   - MAPs > 60
   - SVO2 > 70%
   - albumin 50 mg IV x 1 upon arrival to floor
   - vanc/zosyn; consider linezolid if decompensates given history of VRE
   - sputum, urine, blood, stool cultures
   - would consider pulling R subclav
   - check bladder pressure q6h
   - consider tap if pressures improve
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Was hypoxic on floor and hypercapneic on
   arrival to unit in setting of somnolence.  ABG with acute respiratory
   acidosis, acidemia, likely aggravated by large abdomen, pleural
   effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung
   disease from smoking history, though does not carry copd diagnosis.
   Also with productive cough developing during hospitalization c/f pna.
   Intubated after failing trial of bipap.  Also intubated [**Date range (1) 3633**] on
   surgery for hypotension.
   - placed on pressure control because of high PIPs on AC
   - vanc/zosyn as above
   - will place a-line for ABGs
   - will consider therapeutic para to reduce intra-abdominal pressures
   and improve respiratory mechanics
   .
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.
   - vascular reccs
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - albumin for volume expansion
   - will consider paracentesis if BPs stable
   - lactulose
   - liver reccs
   .
   # ESRD: Last HD on [**2111-1-21**], on qMWF schedule.
   - HD likely today
   - renal reccs

The patient is a 55-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, and CAD. He was admitted for upper extremity gangrene and underwent a left brachial to radial bypass, which was complicated by a perioperative MI. He developed bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac ischemia, requiring intubation and pressors. He also has ascites, which was tapped on 1/13 and negative for SBP, but cytology was not sent. An RUQ US showed evidence of cirrhosis and a hypoechoic lesion concerning for HCC. He has been followed by multiple services including vascular surgery, plastic surgery, cardiology, nephrology, and hepatology.

   given increased abdominal distention); the tap was consistent with SBP
   and he was started on ceftriaxone.
   24 Hour Events:
   Albumin x1. Therapeutic paracentesis (1.8L) which improved ventilation
   and oxygenation (and reduced bladder pressures). Inotropes not
   required. CXR with L pleural effusion. ABG c/w acute repiratory
   acidosis. BiPap not tolerated, so intubated yesterday at 8PM. PCV for
   high PIPs.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55M (HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p perioperative MI
   and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial
   to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative MI, was
   transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now transferred to
   MICU for management of hypotension and respiratory failure.
   #Sepsis / hypotension: No organism isolated to date. Sources include
   SBP (dx
ed [**2111-1-23**] paracentesis), R subclavian / L HD line, PNA
   (productive of sputum), urosepsis. Less likely due to cellulitis around
   graft site.
   -Now patient is volume responsive in setting of fevers and
   leukocytosis, so heart failure unlikely. After volume resussicitated,
   we will keep in mind his CHF with EF 20%
   [] MAP > 60 with levophed if needed
   [] albumin x1 now, additional albumin or IVF as needed
   [] resite CVC
   [] re-attempt arterial access (although failed to find good target UE
   or femoral with attending and U/S guidance)
   [] follow bladder pressures
   [] follow CVO2
   [] continue vanc/zosyn (started last night); consider linezolid if
   decompensates given history of VRE
   []  sputum, urine, blood, stool cultures
   #Respiratory failure: Most likely due to new L pleural effusion between
   [**1-19**] and [**1-23**] CXR. L pleural effusion resolved after therapeutic
   paracentesis overnight. Other possible contribution from productive
   cough developed during hospitalization. Now on 23/12 PCV.
   [] lighten sedation
   [] Reduce set rate to 20
   [] Decrease PEEP to 10
   [] Now daily CXR, monitor for recurrence of pleural effusion and repeat
   paracentesis if necessary
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.
   - vascular reccs
   - cont vancomycin for ?cellulitis
   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - cont lactulose
   - liver c/s recs
   - when stable consider further imaging while in-house. MRI with
   contrast contraindicated [**2-17**] ESRD. GI recs repeat U/S in 3 months.
   # ESRD: Last HD on [**2111-1-21**], on qMWF schedule.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multi-organ failure and septic shock. The patient's condition has been unstable, with persistent fever, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Blood cultures were obtained to identify the causative organism of the infection. Antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) was started. The patient is also receiving vasopressor support with Fentanyl and Midazolam for sedation. Dialysis catheter placement was performed to manage renal dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent septic shock leading to further organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Complications related to dialysis catheter placement, such as bleeding or infection.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis and inadequate renal perfusion.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe pneumonia and sepsis.
6. Nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
7. Hemodynamic instability and arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and cardiac dysfunction.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding or stress ulcers due to prolonged critical illness and use of corticosteroids.
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism"

   HPI:
    Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for upper extremity gangrene,
   underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by
   perioperative MI (cards thought it was NSTEMI [**2-17**] demand). Pt  was
   transferred to medicine for ascites and bradycardia, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and question sepsis.
   He was admitted to the vascular surgery service on [**2111-1-7**] for chronic
   bilateral finger infections and ischemic digits. He underwent bilateral
   upper extremity angiogram on [**2111-1-8**] and then left brachial to radial
   bypass w/ NR basilic vein on [**2111-1-12**]. His hospital course has been
   complicated by asystolic cardiac arrest peri-op and a 4L paracentesis
   on [**2111-1-13**] when he developed bradycardia, hypotension, demand cardic
   ischemia, and unresponsivness that required intubation and pressors.
   .
   Of note, he has developed new ascites after having been told that he
   ""cleared"" his Hep C years ago after tx with ribaviron/interferon in
   [**2101**] at [**Hospital1 12**]. Noted to have a significant alcohol history as well, but
   quit drinking approximately 21 years ago. Abdominal distension has been
   progressive over the last month. Had tap on [**1-13**] negative for SBP;
   cytology not sent. RUQ US on [**2111-1-20**] showed evidence of cirrhosis and
   hypoechoic lesion concerning for HCC.
   .
   He is being followed by multiple services including vascular surgery,
   plastic surgery (for finger wounds), cardiology (s/p cardiac arrest x
   3, feel he has had demand ischemia; symptomatic bradycardia ),
   nephrology (MWF HD patient), and hepatology (for ascites & new liver
   mass).
   .
   He was transferred to medicine on [**2111-1-21**].  In the two days prior to
   admission to the MICU, he was noted to have increased oxygen
   requirement (95% on 5L from 2L previously) and SBPs dropping from the
   100s -> 80s.  He underwent a diagnosis para on the day of transfer
   after receiving albumin 50g (initially planned for therapeutic tap
   given increased abdominal distention); the tap was consistent with SBP
   and he was started on ceftriaxone.
   24 Hour Events:
   Albumin x1. Therapeutic paracentesis (1.8L) which improved ventilation
   and oxygenation (and reduced bladder pressures). Inotropes not
   required. CXR with L pleural effusion. ABG c/w acute repiratory
   acidosis. BiPap not tolerated, so intubated yesterday at 8PM. PCV for
   high PIPs.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a complex medical history including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and previous perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for upper extremity gangrene and underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**], which was complicated by perioperative MI. The patient was transferred to medicine for ascites and bradycardia and is now in the MICU for management of hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

Sepsis/hypotension: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, leukocytosis, and potential sources of infection including SBP, pneumonia, lines (R subclav, L subclav HD), skin cellulitis around graft site, and UTI. Decreased venous return due to ascites may also contribute to hypotension.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
    Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for upper extremity gangrene,
   underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by
   perioperative MI (cards thought it was NSTEMI [**2-17**] demand). Pt  was
   transferred to medicine for ascites and bradycardia, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and question sepsis.
   He was admitted to the vascular surgery service on [**2111-1-7**] for chronic
   bilateral finger infections and ischemic digits. He underwent bilateral
   upper extremity angiogram on [**2111-1-8**] and then left brachial to radial
   bypass w/ NR basilic vein on [**2111-1-12**]. His hospital course has been
   complicated by asystolic cardiac arrest peri-op and a 4L paracentesis
   on [**2111-1-13**] when he developed bradycardia, hypotension, demand cardic
   ischemia, and unresponsivness that required intubation and pressors.
   .
   Of note, he has developed new ascites after having been told that he
   ""cleared"" his Hep C years ago after tx with ribaviron/interferon in
   [**2101**] at [**Hospital1 12**]. Noted to have a significant alcohol history as well, but
   quit drinking approximately 21 years ago. Abdominal distension has been
   progressive over the last month. Had tap on [**1-13**] negative for SBP;
   cytology not sent. RUQ US on [**2111-1-20**] showed evidence of cirrhosis and
   hypoechoic lesion concerning for HCC.
   .
   He is being followed by multiple services including vascular surgery,
   plastic surgery (for finger wounds), cardiology (s/p cardiac arrest x
   3, feel he has had demand ischemia; symptomatic bradycardia ),
   nephrology (MWF HD patient), and hepatology (for ascites & new liver
   mass).
   .
   He was transferred to medicine on [**2111-1-21**].  In the two days prior to
   admission to the MICU, he was noted to have increased oxygen
   requirement (95% on 5L from 2L previously) and SBPs dropping from the
   100s -> 80s.  He underwent a diagnosis para on the day of transfer
   after receiving albumin 50g (initially planned for therapeutic tap
   given increased abdominal distention); the tap was consistent with SBP
   and he was started on ceftriaxone.
   24 Hour Events:
   Albumin x1. Therapeutic paracentesis (1.8L) which improved ventilation
   and oxygenation (and reduced bladder pressures). Inotropes not
   required. CXR with L pleural effusion. ABG c/w acute repiratory
   acidosis. BiPap not tolerated, so intubated yesterday at 8PM. PCV for
   high PIPs.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55M (HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p perioperative MI
   and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial
   to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative MI, was
   transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now transferred to
   MICU for management of hypotension and respiratory failure.
   #Sepsis / hypotension: No organism isolated to date. Sources include
   SBP (dx
ed [**2111-1-23**] paracentesis), R subclavian / L HD line, PNA
   (productive of sputum), urosepsis. Less likely due to cellulitis around
   graft site.
   -Now patient is volume responsive in setting of fevers and
   leukocytosis, so heart failure unlikely. After volume resussicitated,
   we will keep in mind his CHF with EF 20%
   [] MAP > 60 with levophed if needed
   [] albumin x1 now, additional albumin or IVF as needed
   [] resite CVC
   [] re-attempt arterial access (although failed to find good target UE
   or femoral with attending and U/S guidance)
   [] follow bladder pressures
   [] follow CVO2
   [] continue vanc/zosyn (started last night); consider linezolid if
   decompensates given history of VRE
   []  sputum, urine, blood, stool cultures
   #Respiratory failure: Most likely due to new L pleural effusion between
   [**1-19**] and [**1-23**] CXR. L pleural effusion resolved after therapeutic
   paracentesis overnight. Other possible contribution from productive
   cough developed during hospitalization. Now on 23/12 PCV.
   [] lighten sedation
   [] Reduce set rate to 20
   [] Decrease PEEP to 10
   [] Now daily CXR, monitor for recurrence of pleural effusion and repeat
   paracentesis if necessary
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a complex medical history including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for upper extremity gangrene and underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**]. He experienced a perioperative MI and was transferred to medicine for ascites and bradycardia. The patient is now in the MICU for management of hypotension and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection including SBP, R subclavian / L HD line, PNA, and urosepsis. It is important to identify the causative organism and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a new left pleural effusion. Close monitoring and daily chest X-rays are recommended to assess for recurrence of pleural effusion and repeat paracentesis if necessary.
3. PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis: The patient's peripheral vascular disease and bypass graft may require further evaluation and management. Antibiotic therapy should be continued for cellulitis.
4. HCV Cirrhosis/Liver Mass: The patient has cirrhosis and ascites with a 1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion concerning for"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD
   s/p perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for upper extremity
   gangrene, underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**]
   complicated by perioperative MI, was transferred to medicine for
   ascites and bradycardia, and is now transferred to MICU for management
   of hypotension and question sepsis.
   He was admitted to the vascular surgery service on [**2111-1-7**] for chronic
   bilateral finger infections and ischemic digits. He underwent bilateral
   upper extremity angiogram on [**2111-1-8**] and then left brachial to radial
   bypass w/ NR basilic vein on [**2111-1-12**]. His hospital course has been
   complicated by asystolic cardiac arrest peri-op and a 4L paracentesis
   on [**2111-1-13**] when he developed bradycardia, hypotension, demand cardic
   ischemia, and unresponsivness that required intubation and pressors.
   .
   Of note, he has developed new ascites after having been told that he
   ""cleared"" his Hep C years ago after tx with ribaviron/interferon in
   [**2101**] at [**Hospital1 12**]. Noted to have a significant alcohol history as well, but
   quit drinking approximately 21 years ago. Abdominal distension has been
   progressive over the last month. Had tap on [**1-13**] negative for SBP;
   cytology not sent. RUQ US on [**2111-1-20**] showed evidence of cirrhosis and
   hypoechoic lesion concerning for HCC.
   .
   He is being followed by multiple services including vascular surgery,
   plastic surgery (for finger wounds), cardiology (s/p cardiac arrest x
   3, feel he has had demand ischemia; symptomatic bradycardia ),
   nephrology (MWF HD patient), and hepatology (for ascites & new liver
   mass).
   .
   He was transferred to medicine on [**2111-1-21**].  In the two days prior to
   admission to the MICU, he was noted to have increased oxygen
   requirement (95% on 5L from 2L previously) and SBPs dropping from the
   100s -> 80s.  He underwent a diagnosis para on the day of transfer
   after receiving albumin 50g (initially planned for therapeutic tap
   given increased abdominal distention); the tap was consistent with SBP
   and he was started on ceftriaxone.
   24 Hour Events:
   PCV vent overnight. R IJ placed yesterday afternoon but went to
   sub-clavian on CXR and was removed without complication.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55M (HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p perioperative MI
   and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial
   to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative MI, was
   transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now transferred to
   MICU for management of hypotension and respiratory failure.
   #Sepsis / hypotension. Fever free for 24 hour (last > 100.5 24hr ago).
   Leukocytosis mildly increased from 17 to 19 overnight.
   Sources include SBP (dx
ed [**2111-1-23**] paracentesis), urosepsis (urine cx
   +ve for >100K GNR). Also possible R subclavian / L HD line, PNA
   (productive of sputum). Less likely due to cellulitis around graft
   site.
   -Likely sepsis and volume responsive on admission, fever curve
   improved. We will keep in mind his CHF with EF 20%
   [] MAP > 60 (now off pressors)
   [] resite CVC
   --Arterial access (including R UE radial / brachial with Doppler
   guidance failed [**2-17**] vasculopathy). Will consider re-attempt in future.
   --bladder pressures stable
   --continue vanc/zosyn (started last night); consider linezolid if
   decompensates given history of VRE
   --f/u sputum, urine, blood, stool cultures
 esp. urine speciation and
   sensitivities
   #Respiratory failure: Decompensation leading to MICU transfer Most
   likely due to new L pleural effusion between [**1-19**] and [**1-23**] CXR. L
   pleural effusion resolved after therapeutic paracentesis overnight.
   Today
s CXR shows continued R hilar and RLL opacity (PNA versus likely
   edema). L fields are improved but continued L hilar opacity (also
   infection versus edema). Now on 23/12 PCV.
   --Reversible barriers to extubation include possible pulmonary edema
   and pneumonia. Mental status not a likely barrier once sedation lifted.
   [] Net I/O negative as tolerated by CVVH
   [] cont vanc / Zosyn
   [] cont suction / pulmonary toilet
   [] daily sedation holiday
   [] daily CXR
   #Increasing INR (now 1.5): Etiology include nutrition and SBP. No clear
   evidence of DIC.
   [] Monitor, DIC labs if worsening.
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.

","The patient is a 55-year-old man with a complex medical history including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, and CAD who underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery. He has been admitted multiple times for various complications, including upper extremity gangrene, ascites, bradycardia, and sepsis. 

The patient's current presentation includes hypotension, respiratory failure, suspected sepsis due to SBP, urosepsis, and pneumonia. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the MICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection with positive blood cultures and elevated leukocyte count. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to control the infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation parameters, and daily sedation holidays should be considered.

3. Liver Failure: The patient has cirrhosis and ascites, indicating decompensated liver disease. Close monitoring of liver function tests and management of ascites with diuretics or paracentesis may be necessary.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and requires dialysis. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management of fluid and electrolyte balance are necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, who underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative MI. He was admitted for worsening peripheral vascular disease and is now in the ICU for management of hypotension and respiratory failure.

24-hour events include multi-lumen insertion, fever, and leukocytosis. The patient has been volume responsive with fevers and leukocytosis, making heart failure unlikely. His MAP is greater than 60 with the use of levophed if needed. He received albumin, and additional fluids or albumin will be given as needed. The central venous catheter will be repositioned, and arterial access will be reattempted. Bladder pressures and CVO2 will be followed.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a new left pleural effusion between [**1-19**] and [**1-23**], which resolved after therapeutic paracentesis. Other possible contributions include a productive cough developed during hospitalization. The patient is currently on 23/12 PCV. Sedation will be lightened, the set rate reduced to 20, and PEEP decreased to 10. Daily chest X-ray will be monitored for recurrence of pleural effusion and repeat paracentesis if necessary.

The patient also has a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, and CAD who was admitted for worsening peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery. The patient had complications including perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He was transferred to the medicine service due to comorbidities and is now in the MICU for management of hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, indicating potential sepsis or infection. The source of infection could be spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), right subclavian/ left hemodialysis line, pneumonia, or urosepsis. The patient's heart failure is less likely as he responds well to fluid resuscitation.

The patient's respiratory failure is most likely due to a new left pleural effusion, which has resolved after therapeutic paracentesis. Other possible contributions include a productive cough developed during hospitalization. The patient is currently on pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV).

The patient's increasing INR suggests a possible coagulopathy or bleeding risk. There is also a concern for right fourth peripheral intravenous catheter-related osteomyelitis (PIPO), but this graft will not be used for arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling. The patient has a history"
158604.0,217447,2111-01-25 08:06:00,Physician ,Physician Attending Progress Note,"Chief Complaint:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD
   s/p perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for upper extremity
   gangrene, underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**]
   complicated by perioperative MI, was transferred to medicine for
   ascites and bradycardia, and is now transferred to MICU for management
   of hypotension and question sepsis.
   He was admitted to the vascular surgery service on [**2111-1-7**] for chronic
   bilateral finger infections and ischemic digits. He underwent bilateral
   upper extremity angiogram on [**2111-1-8**] and then left brachial to radial
   bypass w/ NR basilic vein on [**2111-1-12**]. His hospital course has been
   complicated by asystolic cardiac arrest peri-op and a 4L paracentesis
   on [**2111-1-13**] when he developed bradycardia, hypotension, demand cardic
   ischemia, and unresponsivness that required intubation and pressors.
   .
   Of note, he has developed new ascites after having been told that he
   ""cleared"" his Hep C years ago after tx with ribaviron/interferon in
   [**2101**] at [**Hospital1 12**]. Noted to have a significant alcohol history as well, but
   quit drinking approximately 21 years ago. Abdominal distension has been
   progressive over the last month. Had tap on [**1-13**] negative for SBP;
   cytology not sent. RUQ US on [**2111-1-20**] showed evidence of cirrhosis and
   hypoechoic lesion concerning for HCC.
   .
   He is being followed by multiple services including vascular surgery,
   plastic surgery (for finger wounds), cardiology (s/p cardiac arrest x
   3, feel he has had demand ischemia; symptomatic bradycardia ),
   nephrology (MWF HD patient), and hepatology (for ascites & new liver
   mass).
   .
   He was transferred to medicine on [**2111-1-21**].  In the two days prior to
   admission to the MICU, he was noted to have increased oxygen
   requirement (95% on 5L from 2L previously) and SBPs dropping from the
   100s -> 80s.  He underwent a diagnosis para on the day of transfer
   after receiving albumin 50g (initially planned for therapeutic tap
   given increased abdominal distention); the tap was consistent with SBP
   and he was started on ceftriaxone.
   24 Hour Events:
   PCV vent overnight. R IJ placed yesterday afternoon but went to
   sub-clavian on CXR and was removed without complication.

   MICU ATTENDING
   Patient continues on ventilator with O2 sats 100% on FIO2 0.5. VE is
   7-8 L/min. Patient off vasopressors for the past 24 hours. CVVH has
   been started. Antibiotics adjusted for ESBL bacteria in urine.
   On exam, patient is intubated and sedated. Appears comfortable. Chest
   notable for coarse large airway sounds bilaterally. Heart sounds are
   very soft. Abdomen distended with ventral hernia. Right AKA, left BKA.
   CXR shows increased interstitial edema bilaterally with density at left
   base compared to [**2111-1-23**]. In addition, there is vague opacity in the
   left upper zone.
   IMP:
   Respiratory failure
   Renal failure
   Hypotension
   UTI
   Suspect volume overload is playing a significant role in respiratory
   decompensation based on CXR evolution. Would aim for  several days of
   negative fluid balance with CVVH. Cannot exclude a newly developing
   inflammatory process as well. Antibiotics being use for urinary
   infection and possible pneumonia. BP has stabilized with antibiotics.
   Would reduce FIO2 and consider switching to PSV tomorrow.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and question sepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Was hypoxic on floor and hypercapneic on
   arrival to unit in setting of somnolence.  ABG with acute respiratory
   acidosis, acidemia, likely aggravated by large abdomen, pleural
   effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung
   disease from smoking history, though does not carry copd diagnosis.
   Also with productive cough developing during hospitalization c/f pna.
   Intubated after failing trial of bipap.  Improved with 1.6L
   paracentesis.
   - cont to weane vent
   - vanc/zosyn
   - will consider repeat therapeutic para if needed to reduce
   intra-abdominal pressures and improve respiratory mechanics
   - SBT
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   leukocytosis, and periotneal cavity as likely source.  Positive for SBP
   on tap on [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  Other sources of infection include
   pneumonia (productive sputum), lines (R subclav, L subclav HD), skins
   (cellulitis around graft site), and UTI (purulent material drained
   after foley placement).  Decreased venous return may also be
   contributing given ascites.  Dressings for lines last changed on [**2111-1-17**]
   (triple lumen) and [**2111-1-21**] (HD).  Urine cx with GNRs.
   - MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - albumin 25 mg IV bolus
   - vanc/zosyn; consider linezolid if decompensates given history of VRE
   - sputum, urine, blood, stool cultures
   - will attempt to resite CVL, place a-line
   - check bladder pressure q6h
   - consider tap if pressures improve
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.
   - vascular reccs
   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - albumin for volume expansion
   - will consider paracentesis if bladder pressure increases
   - lactulose
   - liver reccs
   # CAD s/ MI: demand ischemia peri-operatively.
   - cont ASA, plavix, statin
   # ESRD: Last HD on [**2111-1-21**], on qMWF schedule.
   - CVVH today

   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and question sepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Was hypoxic on floor and hypercapneic on
   arrival to unit in setting of somnolence.  ABG with acute respiratory
   acidosis, acidemia, likely aggravated by large abdomen, pleural
   effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung
   disease from smoking history, though does not carry copd diagnosis.
   Also with productive cough developing during hospitalization c/f pna.
   Intubated after failing trial of bipap.  Improved with 1.6L
   paracentesis.
   - cont to wean vent
   - vanc. will change zosyn to meropenem given resp failure
   - will consider repeat therapeutic para if needed to reduce
   intra-abdominal pressures and improve respiratory mechanics- currently
   bladder pressures 15
   - SBT
   - attempt volume off for improved oxygenation via CVVH
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   leukocytosis, and periotneal cavity as likely source.  Positive for SBP
   on tap on [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  Other sources of infection include
   pneumonia (productive sputum), lines (R subclav, L subclav HD), skins
   (cellulitis around graft site), and UTI (purulent material drained
   after foley placement).  Decreased venous return may also be
   contributing given ascites.  Dressings for lines last changed on [**2111-1-17**]
   (triple lumen) and [**2111-1-21**] (HD).  Urine cx with Klebsiella.
   - MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - albumin 25 mg IV bolus
   - antibiotics as above; consider linezolid if decompensates given
   history of VRE
   - sputum, blood cx pending
   - check bladder pressure q12
   - consider tap if pressures improve
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and question sepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Was hypoxic on floor and hypercapneic on
   arrival to unit in setting of somnolence.  ABG with acute respiratory
   acidosis, acidemia, likely aggravated by large abdomen, pleural
   effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung
   disease from smoking history, though does not carry copd diagnosis.
   Also with productive cough developing during hospitalization c/f pna.
   Intubated after failing trial of bipap.  Improved with 1.6L
   paracentesis.
   - cont to weane vent
   - vanc. will change zosyn to meropenem given resp failure
   - will consider repeat therapeutic para if needed to reduce
   intra-abdominal pressures and improve respiratory mechanics
   - SBT
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   leukocytosis, and periotneal cavity as likely source.  Positive for SBP
   on tap on [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  Other sources of infection include
   pneumonia (productive sputum), lines (R subclav, L subclav HD), skins
   (cellulitis around graft site), and UTI (purulent material drained
   after foley placement).  Decreased venous return may also be
   contributing given ascites.  Dressings for lines last changed on [**2111-1-17**]
   (triple lumen) and [**2111-1-21**] (HD).  Urine cx with Klebsiella.
   - MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - albumin 25 mg IV bolus
   - antibiotics as above; consider linezolid if decompensates given
   history of VRE
   - sputum, urine, blood, stool cultures
   - will attempt to resite CVL, place a-line
   - check bladder pressure q6h
   - consider tap if pressures improve
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and previous perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**], which was complicated by perioperative MI. He is now in the MICU for management of hypotension and possible sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was hypoxic on the floor and hypercapneic upon arrival to the unit. He has a history of smoking and may have underlying lung disease. He is intubated after failing a trial of bipap. There is a productive cough developing during hospitalization, suggesting pneumonia (PNA). The patient's respiratory acidosis and acidemia are likely aggravated by his large abdomen, pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung disease.

2. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, leukocytosis, and peritoneal cavity as a likely source. He has positive SBP on tap on [**2111-1-23**]. Other sources of infection include pneumonia, lines, skin (cellulitis around graft site), and UTI (purulent material drained after Foley placement). Decreased venous return may also be contributing due to ascites.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, and CAD who underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery. He is currently admitted for worsening peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and is now experiencing hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (87/45 mmHg), normal heart rate (94 bpm), slightly elevated respiratory rate (15 insp/min), and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. His central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range (8 mmHg). Fluid balance shows an intake of 1472 mL, output of 978 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -494 mL. Urine output is low at 23 mL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, calcium gluconate, KCl, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. His blood glucose level is elevated at 111 mg/dL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (17.3 K/uL), low hemoglobin (8.3 g/dL), slightly elevated creatinine (4.0 mg/dL), and elevated troponin-T (3.64 ng/mL).

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis with ascites, ESRD on peritoneal dialysis, diabetes mell"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Was hypoxic on floor and hypercapneic on
   arrival to unit in setting of somnolence.  ABG with acute respiratory
   acidosis, acidemia, likely aggravated by large abdomen, pleural
   effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung
   disease from smoking history, though does not carry copd diagnosis.
   Improved with 1.6L paracentesis.
   -  Extubated this morning.
   - cont vanc/meropenem for urosepsis
   - continue with volume off on CVVH goal -1 to -2L/day
   - daily bladder pressures
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on
   [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont vanoc/meropenem, needs 7 day course; consider linezolid if
   decompensates given history of VRE
   - f/u sputum, blood cx
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.

   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - albumin PRN for volume expansion
   - will consider paracentesis if bladder pressure increases
   - lactulose
   - liver recs

","The patient is a 55-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and a history of perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery. However, he developed complications such as perioperative MI and was transferred to the medicine department due to comorbidities. Now, he is being transferred to the MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.

The patient has several medical issues that need to be addressed. 

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was hypoxic on the floor and hypercapneic upon arrival to the unit. This is likely due to factors such as a large abdomen, pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung disease from his smoking history. However, he does not have a diagnosis of COPD. The patient's condition improved after a 1.6L paracentesis. He was extubated in the morning and should continue with vanc/meropenem for urosepsis. The goal is to maintain a MAP (mean arterial pressure) greater than 60 and SVO2 (mixed venous oxygen saturation) greater than 70%.

2. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient has urosepsis and tested positive for SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) on tap prior to transfer. He should continue"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Was hypoxic on floor and hypercapneic on
   arrival to unit in setting of somnolence.  ABG with acute respiratory
   acidosis, acidemia, likely aggravated by large abdomen, pleural
   effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung
   disease from smoking history, though does not carry copd diagnosis.
   Improved with 1.6L paracentesis.
   - cont to wean vent;  decreased PS with more volume off
   - cont vanc/meropenem for urosepsis; no positive culture data at this
   time
   - will consider repeat therapeutic para if needed to reduce
   intra-abdominal pressures and improve respiratory mechanics- currently
   bladder pressures 15
   - SBT
   - continue with volume off on CVVH goal -1 to -2L/day
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Positive for SBP on tap on [**2111-1-23**] prior to
   transfer.  Urine cx with resistant Klebsiella.
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont vanoc/meropenem, needs 7 day course; consider linezolid if
   decompensates given history of VRE
   - sputum, blood cx NGTD
   - check bladder pressure q12
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.
   - vascular recs
   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - albumin PRN for volume expansion
   - will consider paracentesis if bladder pressure increases
   - lactulose
   - liver recs
   # CAD s/ MI: demand ischemia peri-operatively.
   - cont ASA, plavix, statin
   # ESRD: Last HD on [**2111-1-21**], on qMWF schedule.
   - CVVH - attempt fluid off as tolerated
   - renal recs

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery. Postoperatively, he experienced a perioperative MI and PVD. He was transferred to the MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia and hypercapnia, likely aggravated by factors such as a large abdomen, pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung disease from smoking history. Improving respiratory mechanics may be necessary to manage this condition.

2. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient has positive SBP on tap and urine culture showing resistant Klebsiella. Maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60 and superior vena cava oxygen saturation (SVO2) above 70% are important for managing sepsis-related hypotension. The patient needs a 7-day course of vancomycin and meropenem, and consideration should be given to adding linezolid if the patient decompensates due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and question sepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Was hypoxic on floor and hypercapneic on
   arrival to unit in setting of somnolence.  ABG with acute respiratory
   acidosis, acidemia, likely aggravated by large abdomen, pleural
   effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung
   disease from smoking history, though does not carry copd diagnosis.
   Also with productive cough developing during hospitalization c/f pna.
   Intubated after failing trial of bipap.  Improved with 1.6L
   paracentesis.
   - cont to wean vent
   - vanc. will change zosyn to meropenem given resp failure
   - will consider repeat therapeutic para if needed to reduce
   intra-abdominal pressures and improve respiratory mechanics- currently
   bladder pressures 15
   - SBT
   - attempt volume off for improved oxygenation via CVVH
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   leukocytosis, and periotneal cavity as likely source.  Positive for SBP
   on tap on [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  Other sources of infection include
   pneumonia (productive sputum), lines (R subclav, L subclav HD), skins
   (cellulitis around graft site), and UTI (purulent material drained
   after foley placement).  Decreased venous return may also be
   contributing given ascites.  Dressings for lines last changed on [**2111-1-17**]
   (triple lumen) and [**2111-1-21**] (HD).  Urine cx with Klebsiella.
   - MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - albumin 25 mg IV bolus
   - antibiotics as above; consider linezolid if decompensates given
   history of VRE
   - sputum, blood cx pending
   - check bladder pressure q12
   - consider tap if pressures improve
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.
   - vascular reccs
   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - albumin for volume expansion
   - will consider paracentesis if bladder pressure increases
   - lactulose
   - liver reccs
   # CAD s/ MI: demand ischemia peri-operatively.
   - cont ASA, plavix, statin
   # ESRD: Last HD on [**2111-1-21**], on qMWF schedule.
   - CVVH today- attempt fluid off as tolerated
   - renal reccs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery on 1/12. Postoperatively, he experienced a perioperative MI and was transferred to the medicine department for management of comorbidities. He is now in the MICU for hypotension and possible sepsis.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was hypoxic on the floor and hypercapneic upon arrival to the unit. He has a productive cough developing during hospitalization, indicating pneumonia (PNA). He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There are plans to wean off the ventilator, change antibiotics, and consider a repeat therapeutic paracentesis to reduce intra-abdominal pressures and improve respiratory mechanics.

2. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, leukocytosis, and peritoneal cavity as a likely source of infection. He has positive SBP on tap, pneumonia, lines infection, skin infection, and UTI. He has decreased venous return due to ascites. The goal is to maintain MAPs > 60 and SVO2 > 70%. Antibiotics have been started, and consideration is given to linezolid due to the history of VRE. Blood and sputum cultures are pending.

3. PVD/left brachial to radial bypass/right 4th PIP osteomyelitis: The patient's vascular access will not use this graft for ABGs due to discussion with surgery. He also has R BKA and L AKA. Vascular recourses are planned.

4. HCV cirrhosis/liver mass: The patient has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on 1/13 associated with hypotension and NSTEMI. He has a 1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US concerning for HCC. Normal AFP, and a plan for repeat US in 3 months per liver. Albumin is given for volume expansion, and consideration is given to paracentesis if bladder pressure increases.

5. CAD s/MI: The patient had perioperative ischemia during CABG surgery. Continuing ASA, Plavix, and statin therapy is recommended.

6. ESRD: The patient is on a qMWF HD schedule. CVVH is attempted today with fluid off as tolerated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
- Sepsis/hypotension due to multiple sources of infection, including SBP, pneumonia, lines infection, skin infection, and UTI.
- Liver failure due to HCV cirrhosis and liver mass, which may progress to hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome.
- Cardiac complications due to CAD and previous MI, including ischemia during CABG surgery.
- Renal failure due to ESRD and possible progression to acute kidney injury.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, infection parameters, liver function, cardiac function, and renal function to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, and CAD who presented to the ICU for worsening peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery. He was admitted with hypotension and respiratory failure, possibly due to sepsis. The patient has been extubated successfully and is doing well post-extubation. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/55 to 89/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His temperature is within normal range at 36.6°C (97.9°F). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and high bicarbonate levels. Liver enzymes and other lab parameters are also within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals muscle wasting, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and no abnormal findings in the cardiovascular, abdominal, extremities, or neurologic systems.

The assessment and plan include multiple medical conditions, such as HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, perioperative MI, and PVD. The patient's recent issues include hypotension and respiratory failure, which have improved after volume removal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with chronic renal failure, acidosis, respiratory shock, and septic shock. The patient has been extubated and is doing well on a nasal cannula. He has been off pressors all day and his CVVH was stopped. The patient's blood pressure dropped at around 8 PM, so 25 gm albumin was given without much improvement. He was then started back on levophed and attempted to wean down, with no mental status changes with low BPs.

Infusions include heparin sodium for prophylaxis and morphine sulfate. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on 01/28/2111 at 07:47 AM.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vitals are stable with a temperature of 37 C (98.6 F), heart rate of 108 bpm (98-120), blood pressure ranging from 120/66 to 138/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (15-29), and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's weight is currently 76.1 kg (admission weight was 75 kg). His central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg (4-8), bladder pressure is 15 mmHg (15-15), and fluid balance shows a negative balance of"

   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Was hypoxic on floor and hypercapneic on
   arrival to unit in setting of somnolence.  ABG with acute respiratory
   acidosis, acidemia, likely aggravated by large abdomen, pleural
   effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung
   disease from smoking history, though does not carry copd diagnosis.
   Improved with 1.6L paracentesis.
   -  Extubated this morning.
   - cont vanc/meropenem for urosepsis
   - continue with volume off on CVVH goal -1 to -2L/day
   - daily bladder pressures
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on
   [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont vanoc/meropenem, needs 7 day course; consider linezolid if
   decompensates given history of VRE
   - f/u sputum, blood cx
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.
   - vascular recs
   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - albumin PRN for volume expansion
   - will consider paracentesis if bladder pressure increases
   - lactulose
   - liver recs
   # CAD s/ MI: demand ischemia peri-operatively.
   - cont ASA, plavix, statin
   # ESRD: Last HD on [**2111-1-21**], on qMWF schedule.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, hypercapnia, and hypoxia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABG analysis is necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

2. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient has urosepsis and positive SBP. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial to prevent septic shock.

3. PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis: The patient's bypass graft may not be used for ABGs due to osteomyelitis. Regular vascular assessments are essential to monitor graft patency and prevent further complications.

4. HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass: The patient has cirrhosis and a liver mass concerning for HCC. Regular monitoring of liver function and follow-up ultrasounds are needed to assess the progression of liver disease.

5. CAD s/ MI: The patient has a history of CAD and perioperative MI. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and ongoing management of risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are necessary to prevent further cardiac events.

6. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on dialysis. Close monitoring of renal function and adherence to the dialysis schedule are essential to prevent further complications related to renal dysfunction.

7. Potential infections: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, regular surveillance for infections, including monitoring of vital signs, temperature, and culture results, is important to prevent and manage any potential infections.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and a history of perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery on [**2111-1-12**], which was complicated by perioperative MI. The patient is currently in the MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was hypoxic on the floor and hypercapneic upon arrival to the unit, indicating respiratory distress. This could be due to underlying lung disease from smoking history, pleural effusions, large abdomen, and muscular weakness from critical illness. The patient has improved with paracentesis but requires close monitoring of respiratory status.

2. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient has urosepsis and positive SBP on tap prior to transfer. He needs aggressive management to maintain MAPs > 60 and SVO2 > 70%. Antibiotics should be continued for a 7-day course, and consideration should be given to adding linezolid if the patient decompensates due to history of VRE.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on
   [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont meropenem, needs 7 day course (last day [**2111-12-1**]); consider
   linezolid if decompensates given history of VRE
   - f/u sputum, blood cx
   - diagnostic para today to eval for possible SBP with resistant
   organisms or VRE
   - albumin 25 gm x 1 today
   - wean levophed to off as tolerated
   - recheck BP
   # Respiratory failure:  Was hypoxic on floor and hypercapneic on
   arrival to unit in setting of somnolence.  ABG with acute respiratory
   acidosis, acidemia, likely aggravated by large abdomen, pleural
   effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung
   disease from smoking history, though does not carry copd diagnosis.
   Improved with 1.6L paracentesis.
   - cont meropenem for urosepsis
   - will try to keep at dry weight given pressor requirement
   - daily bladder pressures
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.
   - vascular recs
   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - albumin PRN for volume expansion
   - diagnostic para as above
   - lactulose- patient refusing but really needs to take this medication
   - liver recs
   # CAD s/ MI: demand ischemia peri-operatively.
   - cont ASA, plavix, statin
   # ESRD: Last HD on [**2111-1-21**], on qMWF schedule.
   - CVVH - attempt fluid off as tolerated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass on 01/12/2111, which was complicated by perioperative MI. The patient is now in the MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has urosepsis and a positive sample for SBP on tap on 01/23/2111 prior to transfer. The plan includes maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60 and systemic vascular oxygen saturation (SVO2) above 70%. The patient is currently on meropenem, and consideration should be given to adding linezolid if the patient decompensates due to history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Diagnostic paracentesis is scheduled today to evaluate for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with resistant organisms or VRE. Albumin will be administered at 25 gm once today, and efforts will be made to wean levophed off as tolerated while rechecking blood pressures.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was hypoxic on the floor and hypercapneic on arrival to the unit"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, and CAD. He was admitted for worsening peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and underwent a left brachial to radial bypass surgery. The patient then experienced a perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to hypotension and suspected sepsis.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, severe PVD, HCV cirrhosis/liver mass, CAD s/MI, and cellulitis. The patient is still on low-dose norepinephrine and is being attempted to wean off. He has a central venous pressure (CVP) line, arterial line, and a dialysis catheter. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 115/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab results are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure due to underlying lung issues or infections, further deterioration of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially intubated for hypercapneic resp
   failure in setting of somnolence (missed cpap while inpatient and
   started on gabapentin) and sepsis.  Improved with 1.6L paracentesis and
   extubated on [**2111-1-27**].  Reintubated again on [**2111-1-29**] in setting of
   hypercapnea, concern for worsening sepsis vs oversedation after
   restarting ms contin.  Resp dynamics also aggravated by large abdomen,
   pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and
   underlying lung disease from smoking history.  Removed 1L + 2L
   paracentesis on [**1-29**].
   - wean sedation and trial of PS
   - cont meropenem/vanc; added gent ([**2111-1-29**]) for double coverage but
   will hold for now
   - bladder pressures q6h
   - avoid sedating meds when extubated
   - goals of care discussion with family
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on
   [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  BP more stable now.
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont meropenem, needs 7 day course (last day [**2111-1-31**]); also on vanc
   and started gent ([**1-29**])
   - consider linezolid if decompensates given history of VRE
   - f/u cx data
   - albumin 25 gm prn
   - wean off levophed to off as tolerated
   - correlate cuff pressures and femoral a-line
   # Anemia:  likely in setting of multiple blood draws and procedures on
   [**2111-1-29**].  Has ACI.
   - recheck hct
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse for hct < 25 though does have CAD
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**], which was complicated by perioperative MI. The patient then experienced hypotension and urosepsis, leading to his transfer to the MICU.

The patient initially required intubation for hypercapneic respiratory failure, but was extubated on [**2111-1-27**]. However, he was reintubated on [**2111-1-29**] due to worsening sepsis and hypercapnea. The patient's respiratory dynamics are complicated by a large abdomen, pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung disease from smoking history.

The patient has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on [**2111-1-23**]. His blood pressure is more stable now, but he requires continued antibiotic coverage with meropenem. He also needs close monitoring of MAPs and SVO2 levels.

The patient is likely anemic due to multiple blood draws and procedures on [**2111-1-29**]. He has ACI and requires reevaluation of HCT levels.

The patient's history includes PVD/"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially intubated for hypercapneic resp
   failure in setting of somnolence (missed cpap while inpatient and
   started on gabapentin) and sepsis.  Improved with 1.6L paracentesis and
   extubated on [**2111-1-27**].  Reintubated again on [**2111-1-29**] in setting of
   hypercapnea, concern for worsening sepsis vs oversedation after
   restarting ms contin.  Resp dynamics also aggravated by large abdomen,
   pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and
   underlying lung disease from smoking history.  Removed 1L + 2L
   paracentesis on [**1-29**].
   - wean sedation and trial of PS
   - cont meropenem/vanc; added gent ([**2111-1-29**]) for double coverage but may
   be able to d/c
   - bladder pressures q6h
   - avoid sedating meds when extubated
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on
   [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  BP more stable now.
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont meropenem, needs 7 day course (last day [**2111-1-31**]); also on vanc
   and started gent ([**1-29**])
   - consider linezolid if decompensates given history of VRE
   - f/u cx data
   - albumin 25 gm prn
   - off wean levophed to off as tolerated
   - correlate cuff pressures and femoral a-line
   # Anemia:  likely in setting of multiple blood draws and procedures on
   [**2111-1-29**].  Has ACI.
   - recheck hct
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse for hct < 25 though does have CAD
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, and CAD who was admitted for worsening PVD. He underwent a left brachial to radial bypass surgery on [**2111-1-12**] and was transferred to the MICU due to hypotension and suspected sepsis. The patient has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, severe peripheral vascular disease, liver mass, and a history of myocardial infarction. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been reintubated due to worsening acidemia and hypercarbia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory condition, indicated by increased pCO2 levels and subsequent reintubation, suggests a high risk of further respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis/Hypotension: The presence of hypotension and suspected sepsis raises concerns about potential organ dysfunction and septic shock.
3. Severe Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient's history of PVD and recent bypass surgery puts him at risk for complications related to inadequate blood flow to the extremities, such as tissue necrosis or gangrene.
4. Liver Mass/HCC: The 1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion raises concerns for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to determine the appropriate management plan.
5. History of CAD/MI:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially intubated for hypercapneic resp
   failure in setting of somnolence (missed cpap while inpatient and
   started on gabapentin) and sepsis.  Improved with 1.6L paracentesis and
   extubated on [**2111-1-27**].  Reintubated again on [**2111-1-29**] in setting of
   hypercapnea, concern for worsening sepsis vs oversedation after
   restarting ms contin.  Resp dynamics also aggravated by large abdomen,
   pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and
   underlying lung disease from smoking history.  Removed 1L + 2L
   paracentesis on [**1-29**].
   - cont to wean vent
   - cont meropenem/vanc.  Hold off on double coverage for now
   - bladder pressures q6h
   - avoid sedating meds when extubated
   - goals of care discussion with family- family meeting on Monday [**2-2**]
   - wean midazolam/fentanyl; switch to propofol and tolerate increased
   levels for levophed if needed
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on
   [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  BP more stable now.  Repeat urine culture
   from [**1-29**] with GNRs again.
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont meropenem, needs 7 day course (last day [**2111-1-31**])- will continue
   meropenem for now until the culture sensitivities available; also on
   vanc- will keep vanco on for one more day, if all cultures still no
   GPC, will stop vanco
   - consider linezolid if decompensates given history of VRE
   - f/u cx data- ask micro to get sensitivities on [**1-29**] urine culture in
   case meropenem resistant
   - albumin 25 gm prn; but first check CVP and MVO2 sat along with
   lactate
   - wean off levophed to off as tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery, which was complicated by perioperative MI. He is currently in the MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis/hypotension, anemia, PVD/left brachial to radial bypass/right 4th PIP osteomyelitis, HCV cirrhosis/liver mass, CAD s/p MI, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of hypercapneic respiratory failure and sepsis. He was initially intubated due to hypercapnea in the setting of somnolence. He was extubated on [**2111-1-27**] but reintubated on [**2111-1-29**] in the setting of hypercapnea, concern for worsening sepsis vs oversedation after restarting MS Contin. The patient's respiratory dynamics are aggravated by large abdomen, pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung disease from smoking history.

2. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on [**2111"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, ESLD, ESRD, restrictive
   ventilatory failure in the setting of ACC from ascites.
   Vent dependent due to refractory ascites.
   Sedation held, follows commands.
   Remains on levophed. ESBL Klebs, SBP, ACC.
   Main plan: Paracentesis to optimize BP and lung mechanics, try to
   remove pressors.
   Respiratory failure due to ventilator dependence
   -persistent ventilatory dependence due most likely to increased
   abdominal pressures and resultant restrictive lung disease and
   oversedation
   -wean fentanyl to off and use fentanyl boluses as needed
   -propofol drip, will tolerate and increase in pressor requirement for
   change in sedation
   -CXR without evidence of volume overload

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 56-year-old man with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), ESRD (end-stage renal disease), and restrictive ventilatory failure due to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACC) from ascites.
- He was initially admitted for a brachial to radial bypass, but experienced cardiac arrest during a large volume paracentesis.
- The patient was transferred to the floor and then back to the ICU for SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and ESBL Klebsiella septic shock requiring pressors, as well as hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- He was extubated on 1/27 but reintubated on 1/29 for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- Currently, the patient is requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) due to vasopressor requirement.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/63 mmHg to 132/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils bilaterally and distended abdomen.
- Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, leukocytosis with a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, DM, and CAD presenting with multiple medical complications. He initially came in for a brachial to radial bypass and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest during a large volume paracentesis. The patient was transferred to the floor and then back to the ICU due to SBP and EXBL klebsiella septic shock requiring pressors, as well as hypercarbic respiratory failure necessitating intubation. He was extubated on 1/27 but reintubated on 1/29 for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Currently, the patient requires CVVH due to vasopressor requirement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent ventilatory dependence likely due to increased abdominal pressures, resultant restrictive lung disease, and oversedation. Weaning off fentanyl and using propofol drip to increase sedation could help in weaning him off the ventilator.

2. Hypotension and Vasopressor Requirement: The patient has persistent hypotension and continues to require vasopressors. Possible etiologies include septic shock, abdominal compartment syndrome, and possible adrenal insufficiency. Checking CVP, CVO2, and lactate levels, awaiting urine culture sensitivities, and continuing meropenem and vancomycin are recommended. If no gram-positive organisms are found tomorrow"

   ventilatory failure in the setting of abdominal compartment syndrome
   from ascites.
   Respiratory failure due to restrictive chest wall from abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   -TV improved, now up to 700cc on PS 5/5/0.4
   -plan for extubation today with BiPAP as bridge
   -will have family present when extubated to address goals of care.
   Patient will likely need re-intubation when ascites re-accumulates
   Vasopressor requirement resolved with discontinuation of sedation
   -awaiting sensitivities from urine culture (with gram negative rods)
   -repeat urine culture when we have a sample
   -continue on meropenem for GNRs in urine, stop vancomycin today
   -continue with midodrine 10mg TID for now
   Hepatitis C with decompensated liver failure and recurrent ascites
   -continue lactulose and rifaximin
   -liver team does not agree with placement of peritoneal drain but this
   may be an option for palliation
   ESRD on CVVH
   -continues to be run -50cc/hr
   -will discuss with renal about transitioning to HD now that he is off
   pressors
   Ischemic CM with EF 20%
   -continues on ASA and plavix

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including hepatitis C cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a myocardial infarction (MI) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and restrictive ventilatory failure in the setting of abdominal compartment syndrome from ascites.

The patient was initially admitted for a left brachial-to-radial bypass procedure. He experienced cardiac arrest during a large volume paracentesis and was transferred to the floor before being readmitted to the ICU for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella septic shock requiring vasopressors and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation. He was initially extubated on January 27th but had to be reintubated on January 29th due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient now requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to vasopressor requirement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5%), heart rate of 94 bpm (90-107), blood pressure ranging from 101/54 mmHg to 128/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute (11-24), and oxygen saturation of 100"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially intubated for hypercapneic resp
   failure in setting of somnolence (missed cpap while inpatient and
   started on gabapentin) and sepsis.  Improved with 1.6L paracentesis and
   extubated on [**2111-1-27**].  Reintubated again on [**2111-1-29**] in setting of
   hypercapnea, concern for worsening sepsis vs oversedation after
   restarting ms contin.  Resp dynamics also aggravated by large abdomen,
   pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and
   underlying lung disease from smoking history.  Removed 1L + 2L
   paracentesis on [**1-29**] and another 5L on [**1-31**].
   - Vt have improved post para, and MV also improved.  Currently [**5-20**].
   Planned extubation today.
   - cont meropenem/vanc.  Hold off on double coverage for now
   - bladder pressures q6h
   - avoid sedating meds when extubated; PRN sedation boluses
   - goals of care discussion with family- family meeting on Monday [**2-2**]
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on
   [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  BP more stable now.  Repeat urine culture
   from [**1-29**] with GNRs again, awaing sensitivities.
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont meropenem, needs 7 day course (last day [**2111-1-31**])- will continue
   meropenem for now until the culture sensitivities available; also on
   vanc- will keep vanco on for one more day, if all cultures still no
   GPC, will stop vanco today
   - consider linezolid if decompensates given history of VRE
   - f/u cx data- ask micro to get sensitivities on [**1-29**] urine culture in
   case meropenem resistant
   - albumin 25 gm prn; but first check CVP and MVO2 sat along with
   lactate
   - wean off levophed to off as tolerated
   - restarted on midodrine 5 mg TID
   - d/w hepatology re peritoneal drain
   # Anemia:  likely in setting of multiple blood draws and procedures on
   [**2111-1-29**].  Has ACI.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - guaiac stools- positive
   - transfuse for hct < 25 though does have CAD possibly later today
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.
   - vascular recs
   - fenatyl and oxycodone for pain control, will address w/ goals of care
   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - albumin PRN for volume expansion if volume down (CVP/MvO2 as above)
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - liver recs.  d/w hepatology regarding drain
   # CAD s/ MI: demand ischemia peri-operatively.
   - cont ASA, plavix, statin
   # ESRD: Last HD on [**2111-1-21**], on qMWF schedule.
   - CVVH - attempt fluid off as tolerated
   - renal recs

   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on
   [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  BP more stable now.  Repeat urine culture
   from [**1-29**] with kleb
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont meropenem, needs 7 day course (last day [**2111-1-31**])- will continue
   meropenem for now until the culture sensitivities available; also on
   vanc- will keep vanco on for one more day, if all cultures still no
   GPC, vanc stopped [**2-1**]
   - consider linezolid if decompensates given history of VRE
   - f/u cx data- ask micro to get sensitivities on [**1-29**] urine culture in

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and previous perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery on [**2111-1-12**], which was complicated by a perioperative MI. The patient then developed hypotension and urosepsis and required transfer to the MICU.

The patient initially required intubation for hypercapneic respiratory failure due to somnolence and sepsis. He showed improvement with paracentesis and was successfully extubated. However, he required reintubation due to hypercapnea and worsening sepsis. The patient underwent multiple paracentesis procedures and is now successfully extubated again.

The patient has urosepsis and a positive SBP on tap. His blood pressure is stable, but he needs close monitoring of MAPs and SVO2. He is currently on meropenem and vancomycin, which will be continued until culture sensitivities are available. If the cultures show resistance to meropenem, linezolid may be considered.

The patient also has anemia, likely due to multiple blood draws and procedures. He has a history of ACI and a positive guaiac stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.

Additionally, the patient has PVD with a left brachial to radial bypass and right "

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and previous perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery on [**2111-1-12**], which was complicated by perioperative MI. He then developed hypotension and urosepsis and required transfer to the MICU. The patient initially required intubation for hypercapneic respiratory failure and sepsis but has since been successfully extubated. He continues to require mechanical ventilation support with CPAP or possibly BIPAP overnight. 

The patient's urine culture from [**1-29**] showed positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae. He is currently on meropenem, which will be continued until culture sensitivities are available. Vancomycin has been stopped, but will be restarted if all cultures remain negative for gram-positive cocci. 

The patient's anemia is likely due to multiple blood draws and procedures. He has a history of ACI and a Hct of [**Hospital1 **]. 

The patient has a history of PVD and left brachial to radial bypass surgery, as well as right 4th PIP osteomyelitis. The graft will not be used for ABGs per discussion with surgery. 

The patient has HCV cirrhosis and ascites, with a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple chronic health conditions, including diabetes mellitus type I, chronic renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for ongoing management. The patient's family was informed about the terminal nature of his disease, involving the liver, kidney, cardiac, and likely recurrent respiratory failure. The patient is currently extubated and on auto-set bipap, doing well. He received fentanyl boluses for left arm pain without respiratory compromise. The patient had a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) but remained hemodynamically stable. The patient's allergies are unknown. The patient has been receiving various medications and infusions, including midazolam, heparin, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, and there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure due to underlying conditions such as chronic renal failure and chronic viral hepatitis.
2. Pneumonia: The chest X-ray shows persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and retrocardiac opacification, which could indicate atelectasis or pneumonia. Given the clinical setting, supervening pneumonia must be seriously considered.
3. Sepsis: The presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the microbiology report suggests a potential infection, which could"

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill-appearing male who experienced an asystolic arrest perioperatively. They are currently in the ICU and have been extubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/62 mmHg to 136/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP. The patient's recent medical history includes a vascular procedure for ischemic left fingers, chronic renal failure, chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis, type I diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease. They have multiple comorbidities and are on several medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), fentanyl, simvastatin, nephrocaps, lidoderm, plavix, ASA, lactulose, pepcid, rifaxamin, and midodrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infections: The patient has an ongoing ESBL Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). They have been on empiric vancomycin and meropenem, with continued use of meropenem due to persistent low blood pressures and presence of Klebsiella in urine. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely experienced respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, DM, CAD s/p MI with EF 20%, admitted initially for L brachial to radial bypass. He experienced cardiac arrest during a large volume paracentesis and was transferred to the ICU for SBP and ESBL klebsiella infection causing septic shock. He also has hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient is currently on CPAP and pressors, but was extubated and reintubated due to worsening respiratory failure. He has a history of R AKA and L BKA, multiple necrotic fingers on L hand, and ulcerated R PIP. His current vital signs are stable, but he is still dependent on the ventilator. He has several medical conditions including severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, ESLD, ESRD, multiorgan failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure, and an ESBL UTI. He is receiving meropenem for the ESBL klebsiella UTI and will continue it pending urine culture results. His respiratory failure is likely due to extrinsic obstruction and volume overload, but has improved and he was recently extubated. The plan is to trial BiPAP and work towards long-term noninvasive ventilation. Other issues include chronic viral hepatitis with cirrhosis, requiring monitoring for complications such as ascites and hepatorenal syndrome. He requires chronic renal replacement therapy and management of chronic anemia. Pain control is also a concern. The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the MICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an ESBL UTI and SBP. There is a risk of developing further infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly. There is a risk of reintubation if he does not tolerate BiPAP or if his respiratory status worsens.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Hepatic Decompensation: The patient has ESLD with complications such as ascites. There is a risk of hepatic decompensation and associated complications like hepatorenal syndrome.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and requires chronic renal replacement therapy. There is a risk of worsening renal function and further complications.
6. Bleeding: The patient has a history of multiple blood draws, which can contribute to anemia. Additionally, he has a history of vascular procedures, increasing the risk of bleeding.
7. Thromboembolic Events: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and chronic immobilization in the ICU, increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7614**] is a 55 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD s/p
   perioperative MI and PVD who was admitted for worsening PVD, underwent
   left brachial to radial bypass on [**2111-1-12**] complicated by perioperative
   MI, was transferred to medicine of comorbidities, and is now
   transferred to MICU for management of hypotension and urosepsis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially intubated for hypercapneic resp
   failure in setting of somnolence (missed cpap while inpatient and
   started on gabapentin) and sepsis.  Improved with 1.6L paracentesis and
   extubated on [**2111-1-27**].  Reintubated again on [**2111-1-29**] in setting of
   hypercapnea, concern for worsening sepsis vs oversedation after
   restarting ms contin.  Resp dynamics also aggravated by large abdomen,
   pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and
   underlying lung disease from smoking history.  Removed 1L + 2L
   paracentesis on [**1-29**] and another 5L on [**1-31**].
   - Vt have improved post para, and MV also improved.  Now successfully
   extubated
   - bladder pressures qshift
   - avoid sedating meds when extubated; PRN sedation boluses
   - will use CPAP or possible BIPAP overnight; and monitor ascites and
   pre-emptively drain
   # Sepsis/hypotension:  Has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap on
   [**2111-1-23**] prior to transfer.  BP more stable now.  Repeat urine culture
   from [**1-29**] with kleb
   - maintain MAPs > 60, SVO2 > 70%
   - cont meropenem, needs 7 day course (last day [**2111-1-31**])- will continue
   meropenem for now until the culture sensitivities available; also on
   vanc- will keep vanco on for one more day, if all cultures still no
   GPC, vanc stopped [**2-1**]
   - consider linezolid if decompensates given history of VRE
   - f/u cx data- ask micro to get sensitivities on [**1-29**] urine culture in
   case meropenem resistant
   - restarted on midodrine 5 mg TID
   # Anemia:  likely in setting of multiple blood draws and procedures on
   [**2111-1-29**].  Has ACI.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - guaiac stools- positive
   - transfuse yesterday w/ appropriate response
   # PVD/Left brachial to radial bypass/Right 4th PIP osteomyelitis:  Will
   not use this graft for ABGs per discussion with surgery.  Also with R
   BKA and L AKA.
   - vascular recs
   - fenatyl for pain control, will address w/ goals of care
   # HCV cirrhosis/Liver mass:  Has cirrhosis and ascites with 4L tap on
   [**1-13**] associated with hypotension and NSTEMI.  History of HCV treatment
   at [**Hospital1 12**].  1.8 cm hypoechoic liver lesion on US [**2110-1-20**] concerning for
   HCC.  Normal AFP; plan for repeat u/s in 3 months per liver.
   - albumin PRN for volume expansion if volume down (CVP/MvO2 as above)
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   # CAD s/ MI: demand ischemia peri-operatively.
   - cont ASA, plavix, statin
   # ESRD: Last HD on [**2111-1-21**], on qMWF schedule.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including HCV cirrhosis, ESRD, DM, CAD, and a history of perioperative MI and PVD. He was admitted for worsening PVD and underwent left brachial to radial bypass surgery. The patient then developed hypotension and urosepsis, leading to transfer to the MICU. The patient's main issues include respiratory failure, sepsis/hypotension, anemia, PVD/left brachial to radial bypass/right 4th PIP osteomyelitis, HCV cirrhosis/liver mass, and CAD s/MI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has had multiple episodes of respiratory failure requiring intubation. There is concern for worsening sepsis, oversedation, large abdomen, pleural effusions, muscular weakness from critical illness, and underlying lung disease due to smoking history. The patient has been successfully extubated but will need close monitoring of his respiratory status.

2. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient has urosepsis and positive for SBP on tap. Despite being stable now, there is a need to maintain MAPs > 60 and SVO2 > 70%. The patient is currently on meropenem and vancomycin, which will be continued until culture sensitivities are available. Consideration should also be given to line"

- He then developed respiratory failure and sepsis, leading to intubation.
- He underwent paracentesis to remove ascites and was extubated on [**2111-1-27**].
- However, he required reintubation on [**2111-1-29**] due to hypercapnea and worsening sepsis.
- He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem) for urosepsis and SBP.
- He has a history of HCV cirrhosis, liver mass, CAD with MI, and ESRD requiring hemodialysis.
- His current vital signs include a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 106/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- His physical examination is mostly not assessed due to his critical condition.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactic acid, and liver enzymes.
- Imaging shows moderate cardiomegaly, severe basal atelectasis on the left lung, and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, recurrent ascites, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post bilateral below-knee amputation. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which have since resolved.

The patient's current condition includes severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, ESLD, ESRD, multiorgan failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure (due to ACS from ascites), and an ESBL UTI. 

The patient's treatment plan includes finishing a 7-day course of meropenem, awaiting sensitivities from the Klebsiella in urine culture, continuing midodrine 5mg TID for blood pressure support, and considering a repeat therapeutic paracentesis due to rising bladder pressures. 

Other medical issues include chronic renal failure, chronic viral hepatitis/cirrhosis with associated complications such as ascites and extrinsic respiratory distress. The patient is currently tolerating hemodialysis and has a low threshold for paracentesis. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on regular diet, RISS for glycemic control, and various lines including a dialysis catheter, PICC line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. Prophylaxis measures include D"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, recurrent ascites, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to an ESBL Klebsiella urinary tract infection, which has now resolved. The patient's current issues include severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, ESLD, ESRD, multiorgan failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure (due to ACS from ascites), and ESBL UTI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can be caused by abdominal compartment syndrome from ascites. This can lead to worsening hypercarbia and respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, there is still a risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of an ESBL Klebsiella urinary tract infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are crucial.
3. End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD): The patient's ESLD puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis, and complications related to ESRD include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.
