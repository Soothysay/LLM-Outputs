   Assessment and Plan
   #  Hypoxia: DDx includes aspiration Pna vs pneumonitis. If not
   aspiration, she is also at risk for CAP. CHF is a possibility given
   congestion seen on CXR, although overall, she does not seem total body
   overloaded based on CVP and exam, Given moderate AS (valve area
   1.2-1.9), she is at risk for poor forward flow. Low suspicion for
   influenza
   - continue NRB
   - nebs RTC
   - continue currently on levaquin and clinda in ED. Would broaden to
   zosyn, levaquin, and vancomycin
   - would repeat echo in AM
   - would hold on diuresis tonight as she was recently hypotensive on
   pressors
   - DFA for influenza
   # Septic shock: currently no longer requiring pressors. Cortisol level
   in ED 58.
   - abx as above
   - f/u blood, urine cx
   - send sputum cx
   - would be very cautious with IVF given mild AS and pulm edema on CXR
   - levophed if needed
   # Bandemia: may be from pna, but given hypoactive bowel sounds and ?
   diarrhea per family, also concern for c. diff
   - empirically treat w/ flagyl
   - send c.diff
   - KUB to r/o obstruction
   # HTN: continue to monitor
   - hold home BP meds until no longer septic
   # Hypoactive bowel sounds:
   - continue to monitor
   - KUB to rule out obstruction

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities including dementia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and fenoral nerve dysfunction. She was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock and required mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of moderate aortic stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9) and recent bilateral iliac artery stenting.

On admission, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic with a blood pressure of 97/53 mmHg and heart rate of 109 bpm. She had an oxygen saturation of 85% on high flow nasal cannula. Her respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute. Physical examination revealed crackles bilaterally at the lung bases, more prominent on the right side, with egophony heard at the left lung base. The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic.

Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 thousand/mm3, elevated lactate level of 2.6 mmol/L, and elevated troponin I level of 0.8 ng/mL. Blood cultures were obtained and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. A chest X-ray showed worsening opacities at the lung bases, cardiomegaly, and mild pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram revealed moderate aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.2-1."

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old woman with development of ARDS following an apparent
   aspiration event Sunday night.  Because of her high level of bandemia,
   other infections (influenza, C diff, etc.) remain in the differential
   are less likely.
   Her film and clinical status have worsened, and our team has discussed
   the intercurrent events with her family.  Her vomiting has abated at
   this point, and we will give a trial of noninvasive ventilation.
   ARDS
   -          Most likely etiology is aspiration, although other
   infections remain in DDx
   -          trial of NIMV.  Would give her period breaks every few
   hours, since this is not likely to resolve in the next few hours.
   -          Mild diuresis
   -          antibiotics to treat possible infections as etiology
   Possible infections
   -          there is high risk for conversion to aspiration pneumonia
   -          vanco, zosyn, and quinolone for possible pneumonia (MRSA,
   resistant GNR, atypicals)
   -          check influenza DFA
   -          check C diff and treat empirically for now, given bandemia

   Total time spent: 40 min
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman who is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) following an apparent aspiration event. The likely etiology of ARDS is aspiration, but other infections remain in the differential diagnosis.

The patient's clinical status has worsened, and the team has discussed intercurrent events with her family. A trial of noninvasive ventilation (NIMV) has been initiated, with period breaks every few hours. Mild diuresis and antibiotics to treat possible infections as etiology have also been prescribed.

Possible infections include aspiration pneumonia, for which vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and a quinolone have been started. Influenza DFA and C diff testing are planned, and treatment for C diff is being administered empirically due to bandemia.

ICU care includes NPO (nothing by mouth) status, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and insertion of a presep catheter and an 18-gauge line. Prophylaxis measures include boots, subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and a stress ulcer H2 blocker. Venous-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention is also noted.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) / DNI (do not intubate), and her disposition"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is hypoxic with an oxygen saturation level of 80-86% on NRB. This indicates inadequate oxygen supply to the body tissues.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The presence of bilateral patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray and worsening opacities at the bases suggests the possibility of ARDS. The patient's CVP of 10 also supports this diagnosis.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia vs. Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP): The patient's underlying etiology for pneumonia is likely aspiration pneumonia or CAP. The worsening opacities at the bases on the chest X-ray suggest an infectious process.

4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has congestion seen on the chest X-ray, although overall she does not seem total body overloaded based on CVP and exam. CHF is a possibility given the findings.

5. Moderate Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient is at risk for poor forward flow due to moderate AS, with a valve area of 1.2-1.9.

6. Sepsis: The patient was previously requiring pressors, indicating hypotension, which could suggest septic shock. However, currently, the patient is no longer requiring pressors.

7. Bandemia: The patient has a high band"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to severe respiratory distress. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dementia. Upon admission, her vital signs included a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 75/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 74%. She was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. The underlying etiology is suspected to be aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis, with congestive heart failure being a possibility as well. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple interventions such as mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation remains low despite high FiO2 delivery, indicating persistent hypoxia. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.
2. ARDS: The patient's CVP of 10, bilateral patchy infiltrates, and worsening condition on CXR indicate the development of ARDS. This condition is associated with high mortality rates and can progress to multiorgan failure.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia vs Pneumonitis: The patient's history of vomiting and the presence of bilateral infiltrates suggest aspiration as a possible underlying etiology for her respiratory distress. This can"
