   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7870**] is a 62 year-old man ileocecectomy for cecal sessile polyp
   complicated by thermal injury, s/p ex-lap and repair, with continued
   fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and hypoxia.
   #) Tachypnea/oxygen requirement:  Continued overnight with new fevers
   and known abdominal process. CXR revealing effusions with possible
   consolidation.  P/F ratio ~ 80, consistent with ARDS from
   sepsis/surgical stress. Also a likely contribution of restrictive
   physiology from pain/distention in the abdomen given low lung volumes.
   - Monitor ABG
   - Supplemental O2 by facemask as needed
   - Low threshold for intubation if needed to maintain oxygenation
   #) GNR bacteremia: The patient is continually febrile overnight despite
   Vanc/Zosyn with known GNR in blood without speciation.  He also
   continues to be tachycardic, but his hypotension has resolved.  Concern
   for pseudomonas, also anerobes.
   - Consider adding Ceftaz for double pseuodmonas coverage, Flagyl for
   further anaerobe coverage
   #) Hypotension:  Currently weaned off of levophed, not requiring
   significant fluids today.  Will continue to monitor via arterial line
   and rescuscitate as needed.
   #) s/p ileocectomy and revision:
   - continue dilaudid PCA
   - monitor Hct for signs of bleeding
   #) Anxiety:  on alprazolam as an outpatient and on surgical service.
   Currently strictly NPO.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man who underwent ileocecectomy for a cecal sessile polyp, which was complicated by a thermal injury and subsequent surgery. The patient is currently experiencing continued fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The chest X-ray reveals effusions with possible consolidation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis/surgical stress, as well as a potential contribution of restrictive physiology due to pain and abdominal distention.

The patient also has Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia, despite being on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. There is concern for pseudomonas and anaerobes. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he has been weaned off of phenylephrine.

Other issues include anxiety, strict nothing by mouth (NPO) status, and ongoing monitoring for signs of bleeding post-surgery. The patient is receiving prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention and stress ulcer prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, sepsis due to multidrug-resistant organisms, bleeding complications from the surgery, and possible development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's current treatment plan includes supplemental oxygen as needed, close monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG), consideration of intubation if necessary, addition of ceftazidime for pseud"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of ileocecectomy for a cecal sessile polyp, complicated by thermal injury, post-ex-lap and repair. He is currently in the ICU with continued fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and requires supplemental oxygen. His blood culture revealed GNRs (Gram-negative rods), but not speciated. There is concern for pseudomonas and anaerobes. The patient's hypotension has resolved, but he remains febrile. He has been weaned off phenylephrine and is now on low-dose heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea/Oxygen Requirement: The patient's ongoing need for supplemental oxygen and the presence of fever and tachypnea suggest a possible progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to sepsis and surgical stress. Close monitoring of ABG and oxygenation levels is necessary. Low threshold for intubation if needed to maintain oxygenation.
2. GNR Bacteremia: The patient's continued febrile state despite antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam indicates possible resistance or inadequate coverage. There is concern for pseudomonas and anaerobes. Adding Ceftazidime for double coverage against pseudomonas and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fever, respiratory distress, and hypotension. The patient's fever persists despite antibiotic therapy. The patient's respiratory distress improved with Ativan administration at 4 am. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a low central venous pressure (CVP) and significant fluid intake and output imbalance. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, Heparin, lorazepam, famotidine, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the continued fever. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and altered liver function tests. Imaging reveals a right-sided pleural effusion. Microbiology reports indicate the presence of Gram-negative rods. The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including an arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and nasogastric tube. The patient is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels suggest ongoing infection and sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate"

   complicated by thermal injury, s/p ex-lap and repair, with continued
   fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and hypoxia.
   #) Tachypnea/oxygen requirement:  Continued overnight with new fevers
   and known abdominal process. CXR revealing effusions with possible
   consolidation.  P/F ratio ~ 80, consistent with ARDS from
   sepsis/surgical stress. Also a likely contribution of restrictive
   physiology from pain/distention in the abdomen given low lung volumes.
   - Monitor ABG
   - Supplemental O2 by facemask as needed
   - Low threshold for intubation if needed to maintain oxygenation
   #) GNR bacteremia: The patient is continually febrile overnight despite
   Vanc/Zosyn with known GNR in blood without speciation.  He also
   continues to be tachycardic, but his hypotension has resolved.  Concern
   for pseudomonas, also anerobes.
   - Consider adding Ceftaz for double pseuodmonas coverage, Flagyl for
   further anaerobe coverage
   #) Hypotension:  Currently weaned off of levophed, not requiring
   significant fluids today.  Will continue to monitor via arterial line
   and rescuscitate as needed.
   #) s/p ileocectomy and revision:
   - continue dilaudid PCA
   - monitor Hct for signs of bleeding
   #) Anxiety:  on alprazolam as an outpatient and on surgical service.
   Currently strictly NPO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man who underwent an ileocecectomy for a cecal sessile polyp, which was complicated by a thermal injury. He has continued fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for anxiety. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, slightly elevated blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. He is on multiple IV medications including antibiotics, pain management, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient has been monitored with arterial and multi-lumen lines. His blood culture results indicate a possible GNR bacteremia. He is still strictly NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving nutrition through ice chips. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. He also has low potassium and magnesium levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's oxygen requirements, tachypnea, and chest X-ray findings suggest the possibility of ARDS. It is important to monitor ABG (arterial blood gas) levels, provide supplemental oxygen as needed, and consider intubation if necessary to maintain oxygenation.
2. GNR Bacteremia: The patient's continued fever despite antibiotic therapy and the presence of GNR in his blood culture indicate a potential bacterial infection. Adding ceftazidime for"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 7870**] is a 62 year-old man ileocecectomy for cecal sessile polyp
   complicated by thermal injury, s/p ex-lap and repair, with continued
   fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and hypoxia.
   #) Tachypnea/oxygen requirement:  Continued overnight with new fevers
   and known abdominal process. CXR revealing effusions with possible
   consolidation.  P/F ratio ~ 80, consistent with ARDS from
   sepsis/surgical stress. Also a likely contribution of restrictive
   physiology from pain/distention in the abdomen given low lung volumes.
   - Monitor ABG
   - Supplemental O2 by facemask as needed
   - Low threshold for intubation if needed to maintain oxygenation
   #) GNR bacteremia: The patient is continually febrile overnight despite
   Vanc/Zosyn with known GNR in blood without speciation.  He also
   continues to be tachycardic, but his hypotension has resolved.  Concern
   for pseudomonas, also anerobes.
   - Consider adding Ceftaz for double pseuodmonas coverage, Flagyl for
   further anaerobe coverage
   #) Hypotension:  Currently weaned off of levophed, not requiring
   significant fluids today.  Will continue to monitor via arterial line
   and rescuscitate as needed.
   #) s/p ileocectomy and revision:
   - continue dilaudid PCA
   - monitor Hct for signs of bleeding
   #) Anxiety:  on alprazolam as an outpatient and on surgical service.
   Currently strictly NPO.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old man who underwent ileocecectomy for cecal sessile polyp, complicated by thermal injury, and subsequent repair.
- The patient has continued fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
- A chest X-ray revealed effusions with possible consolidation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from sepsis/surgical stress.
- The patient is febrile despite being on vancomycin and Zosyn, with known gram-negative rod bacteremia (GNR) in the blood, likely including pseudomonas and anaerobes.
- The patient's hypotension has resolved, but he remains tachycardic.
- The patient is strictly NPO (nothing by mouth) and is receiving IV lorazepam as needed for anxiety.
- The patient is monitored with an arterial line and multi-lumen central line.
- The patient is on various prophylactic treatments, including DVT prevention and stress ulcer prevention.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's symptoms of fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, along with the findings of effusions and consolidation on the chest X-ray, suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent an ileocecectomy for a cecal sessile polyp, which was complicated by a thermal injury and subsequent surgery.
- The patient continues to experience fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. A chest X-ray revealed effusions with possible consolidation, indicating ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) from sepsis/surgical stress.
- The patient is being monitored closely, with supplemental oxygen provided as needed. There is a low threshold for intubation to maintain oxygenation.
- Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance, aiming for a negative balance of 2 liters.
- The patient has a known GNR bacteremia, which is being treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn. There is concern for pseudomonas infection as well.
- The patient's anemia is being addressed with packed red blood cell transfusions.
- Delirium related to Zyprexa and Ativan is present, so the patient will be tried on a home dose of Xanax and given Haldol as needed.
- Tachycardia is likely due to pain and infection.
- Hypotension has resolved, and the patient is no longer requiring significant fluids or levophed.
- Pain management and continued antibiotic therapy are necessary.
- The patient is strictly NPO (nothing by mouth)"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7870**] is a 62 year-old man ileocecectomy for cecal sessile polyp
   complicated by thermal injury, s/p ex-lap and repair, with continued
   fever, tachycardia, tachypnea and hypoxia found to have gram negative
   rod bacteremia.
   # Increased oxygen requirement:  Increased oxygen requirement overnight
   (ABG 7.48/39/70/28/5 on FiO2 74%). CXR this am demonstrates worsened
   pleural effusions (my read).  Effusions secondary to ARDS from
   sepsis/surgical stress. In addition, poor oxygenation secondary to
   restrictive physiology from pain/distention in the abdomen given low
   lung volumes.
   - Monitor ABG
   - Supplemental O2 by facemask as needed
   - Continue to diurese, goal neg 2L (received 20 mg IV Lasix this am)
   - CXR am daily
   # Fever/increasing WBC: Tmax 102.5 F. WBC increased from 4.7 to 8.5, N
   86%, band 1%. Blood pressure stable 108-171/53-80, HR 88-115. Currently
   being treated for GNR bacteremia with Flagyl/Vanco/Cipro IV. Patient
   with new diarrhea, concerned for C. Diff. Due to history of
   ileocecectomy concern for abscess.
   - Continue Flagyl/Vanc/Cipro IV
   - stool studies X 3 to eval for C. Diff (1^st set negative)
   - f/u blood cultures
   # Anemia: HCT 22 to 28.6 this am following 2 Units pRBC
   # Anxiety: Started home dose Celexa (every other day). Anxiety improved
   overnight with Xanax (unclear dose - daughter says rarely ever uses
   xanax, wife says he uses xanax q6 every day ).
   - Contact pharmacy for home medication doses
   - For now, continue Celexa 10 mg every other day, lorazepam IV PRN
   # Hypotension:  Resolved, range from 108-171/53-80, off  levophed. Not
   requiring significant fluids today.  Will continue to monitor via
   arterial line and rescuscitate as needed.
   # s/p ileocectomy and revision:  No longer requires dilaudid PCA.
   - clears today, discuss with surgery time course over advancement
   # Thrombocytopenia: Today 88, range from 88-166. Started to decrease
   Day 2 hospital course therefore unlikely HIT. Most likely secondary to
   sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor

","The patient is a 62-year-old male who underwent ileocecectomy for a cecal sessile polyp, complicated by thermal injury, s/p ex-lap and repair. He is currently in the ICU due to continued fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and has been found to have gram-negative rod bacteremia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing increased oxygen requirement, with an ABG showing 7.48/39/70/28/5 on FiO2 74%. This indicates respiratory distress and poor oxygenation. The CXR demonstrates worsened pleural effusions, which are secondary to ARDS from sepsis/surgical stress. The patient's low lung volumes are also contributing to poor oxygenation.
2. Pain control: The patient has acute and chronic pain due to the surgical procedure and associated complications. He is currently on dilaudid PCA but no longer requires it.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has a gram-negative rod bacteremia and is being treated with Flagyl/Vanco/Cipro IV. There is concern for C. Diff due to the patient's ileocecectomy and new diarrhea.
4. Shock, septic: The patient's blood pressure is stable but has been fluctuating, ranging from 108-171/53-80. He was previously on levophed but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who underwent an ileocecectomy for a cecal sessile polyp and thermal injury. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with GNR bacteremia and is being treated with Flagyl, Vanco, and Cipro IV. He also has new diarrhea, which is a concern for Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection. The patient's hemoglobin level has improved from 22 to 28.6% after receiving two units of packed red blood cells (pRBC). He is experiencing anxiety and has been started on home doses of Celexa (every other day) and Xanax (q6 every day). His blood pressure has stabilized and he no longer requires significant fluids or vasoactive medications. The patient's platelet count is low but improving. He has had multiple line placements, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and 18-gauge line. His nutritional intake is limited to sips only, and he is not receiving any insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and famotidine for stress ulcer prevention. The patient's family has been informed about his condition, and his disposition is pending further assessment.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who underwent an ileocecectomy for a cecal sessile polyp with thermal injury. The patient continues to experience fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and has been diagnosed with GNR bacteremia. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Increased oxygen requirement: The patient's oxygenation is poor due to restrictive physiology from pain and distention in the abdomen, leading to low lung volumes. This can result in further respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange.

2. Effusions secondary to ARDS from sepsis/surgical stress: The patient may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a result of sepsis and surgical stress. ARDS can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the lungs, impairing oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to sepsis. Thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding complications.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 22 to 28.6. Anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.

5. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which may be related to the recent surgery and hospital stay. Untreated anxiety can lead to increased stress and agitation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who underwent ileocecectomy for a cecal sessile polyp and suffered a thermal injury during the surgery. He has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient was found to have gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia and is being treated with antibiotics.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's increasing oxygen requirement, effusions, and poor oxygenation suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe lung damage and respiratory failure.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count (77 K/uL) indicates thrombocytopenia. The etiology of this condition is unclear, but it is unlikely to be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) since the platelet count decreased during the hospital course. Sepsis may be the most likely cause.

3. Anxiety: The patient has been experiencing anxiety, and it has been addressed with medication. It is important to monitor the patient's mental health and adjust the medication dosage as needed.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low (HCT 22 to 28.6), indicating anemia. This may be related to blood loss during surgery or other causes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male who underwent an ileocecectomy for a cecal sessile polyp with thermal injury. He is currently in the ICU due to continued fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with GNR bacteremia and is being treated with Flagyl, Vanco, and Cipro IV. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of hypoxemia, which could be due to sepsis, ARDS, or restrictive physiology from pain and abdominal distention.
2. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's persistent fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia suggest ongoing sepsis, despite receiving antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of progression to sepsis with organ dysfunction if not appropriately managed.
3. Shock: The patient's hemodynamic instability and low blood pressure may indicate septic shock. Continuous monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Anxiety: The patient has been experiencing anxiety, which is being managed with medication. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's mental state and provide appropriate support.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count requires close monitoring, especially considering the recent blood"
