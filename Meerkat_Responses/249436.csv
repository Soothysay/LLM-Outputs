   62W obese, DM - recent admission for abdominal wall cellulitis -
   re-admitted yesterday with abdominal pain and left breast edema. Found
   to have cellulitis with some areas of necrosis. Became hypotensive
   requiring CVL and dopamine. Echo appeared normal. Left LE swelling
   evaluated with LENI which was poor quality.
   She was treated with vanco, zosyn and cipro. Given IVF though quantity
   not clear. Surgery there recommended transferred for further care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old obese female with diabetes mellitus, cellulitis, and a history of abdominal wall cellulitis. She was admitted for abdominal pain and left breast edema, with findings of cellulitis and areas of necrosis. The patient became hypotensive and required cardiovascular support with a central venous line and dopamine. An echocardiogram appeared normal, but the quality of a lower extremity venous ultrasound was poor. She has been treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and aspirin rash. Her medical history includes chronic renal insufficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, hypertension, and Clostridium difficile infection. She is currently on oral vancomycin and embrel with methotrexate.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old morbidly obese woman with diabetes mellitus, who was admitted for abdominal wall cellulitis. She was readmitted with abdominal pain, progressive cellulitis, and ulceration. The patient also has edema in her left lower extremity and is experiencing hypotension, requiring cardiovascular support and dopamine infusion. Her echo appears normal, but the quality of her left lower extremity venous Doppler is poor. She is being treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin, and is receiving intravenous fluids. Surgery recommends transfer for further care, and plastics has already performed debridement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and progressive cellulitis indicate a possible septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's left lower extremity edema raises concerns for DVT, a condition where blood clots form in the deep veins, potentially leading to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
3. Diabetic Complications: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus increases her risk for diabetic complications, such as foot ulcers or infections.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to sepsis, antibiotics, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of abdominal cellulitis. She has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis and hypotension requiring dopamine infusion. She also has hypoxemia, left lower extremity edema, and necrotic cellulitis. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, rheumatoid arthritis, and a history of thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, although pulmonary embolism is also a possible differential diagnosis. Risk factors for PE include recent immobility and morbid obesity. The patient should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. Dopamine should be weaned as tolerated, and cultures should be obtained from blood, urine, and wound sites. Central venous pressure monitoring should be continued, and fluid balance should be carefully managed.

2. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: The patient has necrotic abdominal wounds with cellulitis, which requires urgent surgical evaluation. Conservative management may be pursued initially, but general surgery consultation is recommended. Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam should be continued, and the dose of vancomycin should be adjusted based on the patient's weight. Regular wound care assessments and consideration for de"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with abdominal cellulitis, elevated WBC count, sinus tachycardia, hypotension requiring dopamine, hypoxemia, and left lower extremity edema. There is concern for necrotic cellulitis as well as sepsis versus pulmonary embolism. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: This could be due to sepsis or a massive pulmonary embolism. The patient has risk factors for PE, including recent immobility and morbid obesity.
2. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: The patient has necrotic wounds and cellulitis, which require aggressive treatment to prevent further tissue damage and potential systemic infection.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly, and she has been on heparin subcutaneously. A HIT antibody should be sent, and if there is a clot, ergatroban should be used instead of heparin.
4. DM2: The patient had episodes of hypoglycemia and requires careful monitoring and management of her blood sugar levels.
5. Rheumatoid arthritis: Immunosuppressive medications increase the risk of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION:  Secondary to volume depletion and sepsis.  Abdominal
   wound infection likely source. Still requiring low dose dopamine.  On
   vanco/zosyn, adjust dose given body habitus.  Follow up on cultures.
   Surgical service following along to guide need for debridement.
 ABDOMINAL WOUND INFECTION:  As above. Will try conservative
   management as per surgery but may need to go for operative
   debridement.
 C. Diff:  Oral vanco.  No diarrhea here.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  Had normal platelets prior to admission.  Stable
   but remain at 70K.  Had been on heparin SC at outside hospital.  HIT
   antibody pending.  Change lovenox to foda.  Monitor platelets on vanco,
   does not seem temporally related to starting this drug but it may also
   contribute.  Feel the pros of vanco outway potential cons.
 ANEMIA: Stable.
 DIABETES MELLITUS:  Following sugars in setting of ongoing infection,

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are hypotension and abdominal wound infection. The patient has been in the ICU and received various treatments including dopamine for hypotension, volume resuscitation, and antibiotics for the infection. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins and aspirin, and they are currently on multiple medications including enoxaparin (Lovenox), dopamine, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs indicate a stable temperature within the normal range, but they have an elevated heart rate (110 bpm), low blood pressure (137/46 mmHg), normal respiratory rate (21 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is also obese with morbidly obese abdomen and lymphedema.

Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count (19.2 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (7.9 g/dL), stable platelet count (70 K/uL), and elevated creatinine level (1.2 mg/dL). The patient's glucose level is also elevated at 199 mg/dL.

Imaging and microbiology tests are pending, and the patient is being monitored closely by the ICU team. The assessment and plan include treatment for hypotension due to volume depletion and sepsis, management of abdominal wound infection, monitoring for Clostridium difficile infection, addressing thrombocytopenia, managing anemia, and monitoring"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 62 yo F with abdominal cellulitis, elevated WBC,
   sinus tachycardia, hypotension requiring dopamine, hypoxemia, left
   lower extremity edema, concerning for necrotic cellulitis as well as
   sepsis.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely [**1-21**] sepsis although DDx included pulmonary
   embolism. Elevated WBC, bandemia, and clear focus of infection support
   sepsis. LENIs have been non-diagnostic [**1-21**] to patient's body habitus.
   Risk factors for PE include recent immobility and morbid obesity.
   -bolus with IVF
   -keep MAP>65
   -wean dopamine as tolerated
   -culture blood, urine, wound
   -pull central line from outside hospital and replace with PICC
   -monitor UOP
   -trend fever curve, WBC
   -f/u echo to look for right heart strain
   -after discussion with team, decided not to pursue CTA
   .
   #. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: Patient seen by plastic
   surgery, who feel that this is not necrotizing fasciitis and recommend
   conservative management for now.
   -appreciate plastic surgery recs
   -consult general surgery
   -continue vancomycin and zosyn; increase vancomycin dose given
   patient
s weight of 177 kg
   -check vanco trough prior to 4th dose
   -f/u wound cx
   -wound care consult
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets were around 250 in [**9-/2193**] and are now
   down to 77. Patient has been on heparin SC during this time. Of note
   during her last admission for Klebsiella UTI her platelets dropped but
   also recovered while on heparin SC.
   -trend platelets
   -f/u HIT antibody
   -change lovenox to fondaparinux
   .
   #. DM2: Had episodes of hypoglycemia at [**Hospital3 2346**]. Now
   hyperglycemic here. Will need tight glycemic control in setting of
   infection.
   -Humalog insulin sliding scale
   -status Lantus once patient
s insulin requirements are more clear.
   .
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis: Immunosuppressive meds are predisposing factor
   for sepsis in this patient.
   -hold methotrexate, Cytotec, and Embrel in the setting of infection
   .
   #. c diff: appears to be improving with normal BM here. C. diff
   unlikely to be source of sepsis.
   -continue PO Vanco
   -monitor stool
   .
   #. Anemia: Chronic. Baseline reportedly around around 24. Iron studies
   at [**Location (un) **] showed low iron, with iron 18, TIBC, 138, ferritin 772,
   consistent with iron deficiency and/or chronic disease.
   -monitor Hct
   -transfuse for Hct<21
   -T & S
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely prerenal in the setting of
   hypotension
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   -will not get CTA in order to avoid further kidney injury
   .
   #. ?Penicillin allergy: Patient has tolerated Augmentin and Zosyn, so
   this seems unlikely.
   -will give Zosyn to treat patient's infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of abdominal cellulitis, elevated white blood cell count, sinus tachycardia, hypotension requiring dopamine, hypoxemia, left lower extremity edema, and concerns for necrotic cellulitis as well as sepsis. The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, rheumatoid arthritis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has been refusing anesthesia and any debridement of ulcers in the operating room. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis. It is important to continue IV fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure and wean dopamine as tolerated.
2. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: The patient has necrotic abdominal wounds and cellulitis. It is important to continue vancomycin and Zosyn, increase vancomycin dose considering the patient's weight, check vancomycin trough prior to the 4th dose, follow up wound culture, and consult wound care.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing, and she has been on heparin SC. It is important to trend platelets, follow up HIT antibody, and change lovenox to fondaparinux.

   sinus tachycardia, hypotension requiring dopamine, hypoxemia, left
   lower extremity edema, concerning for necrotic cellulitis as well as
   sepsis.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely [**1-21**] sepsis although DDx included pulmonary
   embolism. Elevated WBC, bandemia, and clear focus of infection support
   sepsis. LENIs have been non-diagnostic [**1-21**] to patient's body habitus.
   Risk factors for PE include recent immobility and morbid obesity.
   -bolus with IVF
   -keep MAP>65
   -wean dopamine as tolerated
   -culture blood, urine, wound
   -pull central line from outside hospital and replace with PICC
   -monitor UOP
   -trend fever curve, WBC
   -f/u echo to look for right heart strain
   -after discussion with team, decided not to pursue CTA
   .
   #. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: Patient seen by plastic
   surgery, who feel that this is not necrotizing fasciitis and recommend
   conservative management for now.
   -appreciate plastic surgery recs
   -consult general surgery
   -continue vancomycin and zosyn; increase vancomycin dose given
   patient
s weight of 177 kg
   -check vanco trough prior to 4th dose
   -f/u wound cx
   -wound care consult
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets were around 250 in [**9-/2193**] and are now
   down to 77. Patient has been on heparin SC during this time. Of note
   during her last admission for Klebsiella UTI her platelets dropped but
   also recovered while on heparin SC.
   -trend platelets
   -f/u HIT antibody
   -change lovenox to fondaparinux
   .
   #. DM2: Had episodes of hypoglycemia at [**Hospital3 2346**]. Now
   hyperglycemic here. Will need tight glycemic control in setting of
   infection.
   -Humalog insulin sliding scale
   -status Lantus once patient
s insulin requirements are more clear.
   .
   #. Rheumatoid arthritis: Immunosuppressive meds are predisposing factor
   for sepsis in this patient.
   -hold methotrexate, Cytotec, and Embrel in the setting of infection
   .
   #. c diff: appears to be improving with normal BM here. C. diff
   unlikely to be source of sepsis.
   -continue PO Vanco
   -monitor stool
   .
   #. Anemia: Chronic. Baseline reportedly around around 24. Iron studies
   at [**Location (un) **] showed low iron, with iron 18, TIBC, 138, ferritin 772,
   consistent with iron deficiency and/or chronic disease.
   -monitor Hct
   -transfuse for Hct<21
   -T & S
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely prerenal in the setting of
   hypotension
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   -will not get CTA in order to avoid further kidney injury
   .
   #. ?Penicillin allergy: Patient has tolerated Augmentin and Zosyn, so
   this seems unlikely.
   -will give Zosyn to treat patient's infection
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now, pending surgery recs re: need for operative

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with abdominal cellulitis, elevated white blood cell count, sinus tachycardia, hypotension requiring dopamine, hypoxemia, and left lower extremity edema. She is also experiencing necrotic cellulitis and sepsis. Other medical conditions include type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is at risk for further complications due to her morbid obesity and recent immobility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be a result of sepsis. It is important to monitor and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The patient should be weaned off dopamine as tolerated, and blood cultures should be obtained. A central line should be pulled from outside the hospital and replaced with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Urine output should be monitored, and fever curve and white blood cell count trends should be tracked. An echocardiogram should be performed to look for right heart strain, and a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) should be avoided to prevent further kidney injury.

2. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: The patient has necrotic abdominal wounds and cellulitis. Conservative management has been recommended by plastic surgery, but general surgery consultation is"

","Summary:
The patient is a morbidly obese individual admitted to the ICU with hypotension. The patient has been off pressors for more than 24 hours, indicating improvement in blood pressure control. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and aspirin. They have received various antibiotics, including piperacillin, tazobactam, and vancomycin. The patient is currently on multiple medications in the ICU.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms, which may be related to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and atelectasis. The patient's vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation but fluctuating blood pressure ranging from 120/43 mmHg to 130/66 mmHg. Respiratory rate is slightly elevated. 

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, morbidly obese abdomen with serosanguinous drainage, right and left lower extremity edema, and erythema over the left calf. Neurologic assessment is incomplete due to lack of movement and tone evaluation.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, platelets, and albumin levels. Blood glucose levels are high, and creatinine levels have slightly increased. Other lab values show normal electrolyte levels and liver function tests.

Assessment and plan include management of diabetes, hypoxemia, hypotension, abdominal wall cellulitis/wound infection, thrombocytopenia, and renal insuff"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2, rheumatoid arthritis, and iron deficiency anemia. She presents with abdominal cellulitis, elevated white blood cell count, sinus tachycardia, hypotension requiring dopamine, hypoxemia, left lower extremity edema, and concern for necrotic cellulitis and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially required pressors to maintain blood pressure, suggesting possible septic shock. Although the hypotension has resolved, close monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: The patient has necrotic wounds and cellulitis, which can progress to necrotizing fasciitis if not managed appropriately. Continuous monitoring of wound healing and infection parameters is essential.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is declining, which could be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia. Regular trend of platelets and further evaluation for HIT antibodies are necessary.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's blood glucose levels are still elevated despite restarting Lantus and increasing the dose of short-acting insulin. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjusting insulin dosage accordingly is important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of abdominal cellulitis, elevated white blood cell count, sinus tachycardia, hypotension requiring dopamine, hypoxemia, and left lower extremity edema. The patient is also being treated for sepsis and necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis. There is a concern for Vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia. The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and rheumatoid arthritis, and is currently taking immunosuppressive medications. The patient appears to have improved from Clostridium difficile infection but is still being monitored. The patient also has chronic anemia and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires careful monitoring and management, including the use of pressors if necessary. It is important to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, bandemia, and clear focus of infection support the diagnosis of sepsis. It is crucial to continue aggressive management with broad-spectrum antibiotics, source control measures, and hemodynamic support.
3. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: Close monitoring of the patient's wound care and regular assessment for signs of worsening infection or progression to necrotizing fasciitis are necessary. Collaboration with plastic surgery is essential for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with several medical conditions and complications. The summary of the information in the note is as follows:

- The patient has abdominal cellulitis, elevated white blood cell count, sinus tachycardia, hypotension requiring dopamine, hypoxemia, and left lower extremity edema. These findings suggest necrotic cellulitis and sepsis.
- The patient's hypotension is resolving, and sepsis is the likely diagnosis.
- The patient has necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis, and conservative management is recommended by plastic surgery. Antibiotics have been adjusted based on culture results.
- The patient is experiencing thrombocytopenia, likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia. Platelets should be monitored, and Fondaparinux has been discontinued.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, and insulin therapy needs adjustment.
- The patient has rheumatoid arthritis and is on immunosuppressive medications, which increase the risk for sepsis.
- The patient had a Clostridium difficile infection, but it appears to be improving.
- The patient has chronic anemia and acute-on-chronic renal failure, possibly prerenal due to hypotension.
- The patient requires nutrition support and glycemic control.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old diabetic and morbidly obese female with necrotic abdominal cellulitis, elevated white blood cell count, sinus tachycardia, and hypoxemia. The patient is currently off pressors and clinically stable. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: The patient has necrotic abdominal wounds and cellulitis, which may require further surgical intervention if the condition worsens. Close monitoring and appropriate wound care are necessary.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is declining, and there is a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia. Monitoring platelet trends and further evaluation for HIT antibodies are recommended. Switching antibiotics to avoid vancomycin is also advised.

3. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient's blood glucose levels are still in the 200s despite insulin therapy. Adjustments to the insulin dosage and sliding scale may be necessary to achieve better glycemic control.

4. Rheumatoid arthritis: The patient's immunosuppressive medications may increase the risk of infection. It is important to consider holding these medications during the setting of infection.

5. Clostridium difficile infection: Although the patient's bowel movement appears to be improving, monitoring stool output and continuing appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old morbidly obese female with necrotic abdominal cellulitis, elevated WBC count, sinus tachycardia, and hypoxemia. She has multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, rheumatoid arthritis, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is off pressors. She has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: The patient has necrotic abdominal wounds and cellulitis, which can lead to further infection and sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, indicating thrombocytopenia. If left untreated, it can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's SpO2 level is 93%, indicating hypoxemia. If not treated, it can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient's blood glucose levels are still in the 200s despite adjustments in insulin therapy. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglyc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of abdominal cellulitis, elevated WBC, sinus tachycardia, hypotension requiring dopamine, hypoxemia, and left lower extremity edema. The patient is also diagnosed with necrotic cellulitis and sepsis. The patient's platelet count is declining, which may be due to Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis, for which she is taking immunosuppressive medications. She also has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not adequately managed with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
2. Necrotic abdominal wounds/cellulitis: The patient's necrotic abdominal wounds may progress to necrotizing fasciitis if not properly managed with wound care and antibiotics.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's declining platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications if not addressed promptly.

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETES:   Poor glycemic control in setting of ongoing infection.
   Increase lantus.
 HYPOXEMIA:  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  No change.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  Workup in progress.  Plts stable.  Now off vanco.
   Following labs.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Continues off pressors, hemodynamically
   stable, OK to go to the floor.
 ABDOMINAL WALL CELLULITIS/WOUND:  Debrided by plastic surgery at the
   bedside, now followed by wound care for dressing changes.  Now on
   dapto/meropeneim.
 C. DIFF:  Continue oral vanco.  Diarrhea continues.  WBC climbing,
   will start IV flagyl.  Repeat stool for C. Diff.
 ACUTE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  Stable Cr, adequate urine output.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing hypotension. The patient's medical history includes diabetes, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, thrombocytopenia, abdominal wall cellulitis/wound, Clostridium difficile infection, and acute renal insufficiency.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 113/46 mmHg, which is low, indicating hypotension. The heart rate is within normal range at 96 bpm. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 25 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 94%, which is below the normal range. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, meropenem) and has a history of allergies to penicillins, aspirin, and heparin agents. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels (potassium, sodium).

The patient's physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, distended abdomen, diminished breath sounds, and warm skin. Neurologic examination was not assessed due to movement restrictions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension leading to shock, development of further infections due to compromised immune system, progression of renal insufficiency, and complications related to diabetes management"
