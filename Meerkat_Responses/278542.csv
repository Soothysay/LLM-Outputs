   concern for SBP and he conts on treatment, compounded by possible over
   diuresis.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics - vanc and aztreonam., will f/u with liver
   as to whether we need to cont coverage, but for now seems reasonable to
   stop flagyl.
   - Given recent prednisone exposure, start stress dose steroids -
   hydrocortisone 50 Q6H, would favor stopping this [**10-14**]
   >Progressive decrease in cell counts:  no clear source from above or
   below. Will check periph smear, d bili retic and haptoglobin for
   evidence of hemolysis. No active bleeding at this time (trace guiac +
   stool).  Seems very rapid for a med effect.  Plan for recheck of CBC
   this afternoon
   - recheck CBC, transfuse for Hct <25, plt <20 (unless active bleeding0
   >Altered MS:   Likely hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic
   patient, improvement with lactulose now A+O x 3
   - standing lactulose, consider addition of rifaximin

   likely with improvement in to 1.2 with hydration. Una is difficult to
   interpret in the setting of recent lasix dosing. He has improved
   markedly with gentle hydration
   > Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72).  Likely low baseline related to liver
   disease/portal hypertension and splenomegaly.  Also consider worsening
   related to DIC from infection, med effect.
   - F/u total protein and cyroglobulin
   - transfuse platelets if actively bleeding.
    > Coagulopathy.  Likely elevation related to cirrhosis.
   - vitamin K x 3 day trial.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis.
- He presented with likely hepatic encephalopathy and hypotension, requiring MICU admission.
- His mental status has improved.
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and aztreonam), but may stop metronidazole.
- Stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone) have been started due to recent prednisone exposure.
- The patient's cell counts have been progressively decreasing, with no clear source identified.
- Plans include checking peripheral smear, direct bilirubin, and haptoglobin for evidence of hemolysis.
- A recheck of the CBC is planned for this afternoon, and transfusion for Hct <25 and plt <20 (unless active bleeding) is considered.
- The patient is showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy, likely due to liver failure.
- Lactulose therapy has been initiated, and the addition of rifaximin is being considered.
- The patient's transaminitis continues to improve.
- Diuretics are being held for now due to hypotension, but may be restarted within the next 24 hours.
- Renal failure is a concern, with unknown baseline renal function.
- Thrombocytopenia is present, likely related to liver disease/portal hypertension and splenomegaly.
- Coagulopathy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely hepatic encephalopathy, hypotension, and no clear infectious source. The patient's mental status has improved, and he is now alert and oriented. 

The patient is on multiple medications, including vancomycin, aztreonam, metronidazole, ceftriaxone, prednisone, and hydrocortisone. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. Liver function tests are abnormal with increased bilirubin and liver enzymes. Kidney function is also impaired. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to septic shock or overdiuresis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, and treatment will continue with ceftriaxone.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status has improved with lactulose treatment. Consider adding rifaximin to manage this condition.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests indicate possible liver failure, which may be related to hepatitis C and alcohol use. Follow-up with liver awareness is advised.
4. Renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and it is difficult to interpret the results due to recent lasix dosing. Gentle hydration has improved the situation.

   57M with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely
   hepatic encephalopathy, now hypotensive requiring MICU admission.
   .> Hypotension. History of chills, leukocytosis and now with
   hypothermia in ED.  Concerning for sepsis.  Possible infectious sources
   as below.  Patient also with previously documented grade III varices so
   at very high risk to GI bleed.  First hematocrit in ED slightly below
   baseline.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be dry from overdiuresis given recent increase in
   diuretic dosing.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics - vanc and aztreonam for now (will need to
   ensure aztreonam with appropriate penetration into peritoneum - prelim
   from pharmacy is okay).  Also add flagyl to provide anaerobic coverage.
   - Urine and blood cultures with plan to try  perform paracentesis [**10-13**]
   although by report there is only small volume
   - Stool for C.diff given recent antibiotic exposure.  Consider KUB.
   - TTE in AM - eval endocarditis or any valvular abnormality to explain
   decreased BP.
   - Given recent prednisone exposure, start stress dose steroids -
   hydrocortisone 50 Q6H.
   .
   >Altered MS:   Likely hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic
   patient.  Confusion with decreased attention; wife also reports ?neck
   drop (appears to be falling asleep), and gait difficulties in addition,
   but overall consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. Will perform head
   CT to rule out acute intra-cranial process. Other possibilities include
   seizures (sub clinical). If no improvement with lactulose then will
   need to consider EEG and neuro input. Urine and serum toxicology were
   negative. Will check serum osmolality and make sure no gap
   - check serum osmolality to (isopropyl etc) to ensure no osm gap.
   - Lactulose 60 ml Q2 until BM, then back off.
   - Followup head CT.
   - Consider neurology consult if not improving.
   - Hold mood altering meds. Consider haldol if agitated.
   .
   >Liver failure:  with transaminitis and an obstructed picture. Will f/u
   the read
   - Liver aware and will follow. Hep C viral load
   - Hold diuretics for now given hypotension.
   - Per wife, there had been some discussion of initiating transplant
   workup here (TTE, liver biopsy); will d/w liver team.
   .
   >Leukocytosis.  With chills, mild hypothermia, concerning for
   infection/sepsis.  UA negative; CXR without infiltrate.  Has history of
   IVDU, at risk for endocarditis/bacteremia if still using (though family
   denies).  Also need to strongly consider possibility of SBP.  Will
   check RUQ to evaluate the gallbladder given obstructed picture.
   - Blood, urine cultures.
   - Paracentesis via ultrasound guidance in AM
   - Cover with antibiotics as above and albumin for SBP
   - Will treat for presumed SBP; in light of renal impairment will also
   given albumin today 1.5 g/kg; 1 g/kg on day 3 if SBP confirmed.
   > Renal failure.  Unknown baseline (no priors at [**Hospital1 5**]).  Hypervolemic
   on exam, but likely intravascularly dry.  Also consider hepatorenal.
   Has been aggressively diuresed in last week or so, making prerenal
   likely with improvement in to 1.2 with hydration. Una is difficult to
   interpret in the setting of recent lasix dosing.
   - Collateral information for baseline.
   - Urine lytes.
   - Bolus as above
   > Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72).  Likely low baseline related to liver
   disease/portal hypertension and splenomegaly.  Also consider worsening
   related to DIC from infection, med effect.
   - Check total protein and cyroglobulin
   - transfuse platelets if actively bleeding.
   > Hyponatremia.  Hypovolemic hyponatermia with cirrhosis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   worsened by recent increase in diuretic dosing.
   - Hold diuresis; support volume status with NS.
   - Recheck in AM.
   > Coagulopathy.  Likely elevation related to cirrhosis.
   - vitamin K x 3 day trial.
   - Continue to trend; FFP if evidence of active bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely hepatic encephalopathy, now hypotensive requiring MICU admission. The patient has a decreased platelet count, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and coagulopathy. He is also at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to previously documented grade III varices. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns for sepsis given the presence of chills, leukocytosis, and hypothermia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, along with flagyl for anaerobic coverage. The plan includes urine and blood cultures, stool for C.diff, TTE in the morning to evaluate for endocarditis or valvular abnormalities, and a head CT to rule out acute intra-cranial process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of chills, leukocytosis, and hypothermia raise concerns for sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential infectious sources.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and confusion are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, a common complication of liver cirrhosis. Lactulose has been started to reduce ammonia levels.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of grade III varices, which puts"

   >Altered MS:   Likely hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic
   patient.  Confusion with decreased attention; wife also reports ?neck
   drop (appears to be falling asleep), and gait difficulties in addition,
   but overall consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. Will perform head
   CT to rule out acute intra-cranial process. Other possibilities include
   seizures (sub clinical). If no improvement with lactulose then will
   need to consider EEG and neuro input. Urine and serum toxicology were
   negative. Will check serum osmolality and make sure no gap
   - check serum osmolality to (isopropyl etc) to ensure no osm gap.
   - Lactulose 60 ml Q2 until BM, then back off.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with hypotension, confusion, and decreased attention span. The patient has a baseline hematocrit slightly below normal. There are concerns for sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, and potential gastrointestinal bleeding due to previously documented grade III varices. The patient has leukocytosis, chills, and mild hypothermia. Blood and urine cultures have been ordered, along with a plan for paracentesis. The patient also has renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and coagulopathy. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and stress dose steroids. The patient is on diuretics, which have been temporarily held due to hypotension. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of hypotension, chills, leukocytosis, and hypothermia suggest the possibility of sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment of the source of infection are crucial.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion, decreased attention span, and altered mental status are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose has been started to manage this condition, and further evaluation with a head CT is planned.

   57M with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely
   hepatic encephalopathy, now hypotensive requiring MICU admission. Now
   with improved mental status.
    Hypotension: no clear infectious source (no fluid to tap, but still
   concern for SBP and he conts on treatment, compounded by possible over
   diuresis.
   - Will narrow coverage to ceftriaxone,as it is not clear that he is
   actively infected. He may  have had SBP in the past (not clear from OSH
   records, clx neg) with plan to complete 7 day course.
   - Given recent prednisone exposure, start stress dose steroids -
   hydrocortisone 50 Q6H, would favor stopping this [**10-14**]
   >Progressive decrease in cell counts:  no clear source from above or
   below. Will check periph smear, d bili retic and haptoglobin for
   evidence of hemolysis. No active bleeding at this time (trace guiac +
   stool).  Seems very rapid for a med effect.  Plan for recheck of CBC
   this afternoon
   - recheck CBC, transfuse for Hct <25, plt <20 (unless active bleeding0
   >Altered MS:   Likely hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic
   patient, improvement with lactulose now A+O x 3
   - standing lactulose, consider addition of rifaximin
   >Liver failure:  thought to be [**12-26**] HepC and EtOH with transaminitis and
   increased alk phos and bilirubin, no evidence of obstruction on the
   RUQ. His transaminitis conts to improve.
   - Liver aware and will follow. Hep C viral load

   - Hold diuretics for now given hypotension recently and consider
   restart within the next 24 hrs.
   > Renal failure.  Unknown baseline (no priors at [**Hospital1 5**]).  Hypervolemic
   on exam, but likely intravascularly dry.  Also consider hepatorenal.
   Has been aggressively diuresed in last week or so, making prerenal
   likely with improvement in to 1.2 with hydration. Una is difficult to
   interpret in the setting of recent lasix dosing. He has improved
   markedly with gentle hydration
   > Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72).  Likely low baseline related to liver
   disease/portal hypertension and splenomegaly.  Also consider worsening
   related to DIC from infection, med effect (aztreonam and PPI)
   - F/u total protein and cyroglobulin
   - transfuse platelets if actively bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presented with likely hepatic encephalopathy and hypotension, requiring MICU admission. His mental status has improved. He is now hypotensive and requires ICU admission. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for an unknown infection source. His lab results show abnormalities in blood counts, liver function, and coagulation parameters. Imaging shows improved lung volumes and increased interstitial markings. The patient is being managed for multiple complications including hypotension, hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can lead to altered mental status and confusion.
2. Infection: The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics for an unknown infection source, indicating a risk of infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
4. Liver failure: The patient's history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis puts him at risk for liver failure, which can cause jaundice, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Renal failure: The patient's unknown baseline renal function and worsening renal parameters suggest a risk of renal failure.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely
   hepatic encephalopathy, admitted hypotensive requiring pressors, now
   improved.
   .
   # Hypotension. chills, leukocytosis, hypothermia in ED.  Concerning for
   sepsis.  Possible infectious sources as below.  No evidence of GIB
   though now with Hct drop.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have been dry from overdiuresis
   given recent increase in diuretic dosing.  Now off pressors.
   - follow hematocrits today.
   - Change antibiotics to SBP coverage alone
 ceftrixone; blood, urine,
   c.diff, pulmonary sources negative.
   - Keep CVL for now..
   - Continue to hold lasix and propanolol for today given recent
   hypotension.
   - Can d/c steroids.
   .
   # Anemia.  Hct drop by 10 points since admission, ?baseline (38-39 here
   in past).  Guaiac positive but not grossly so.  Also with worsening
   thrombocytopenia and dropping WBC count.
   -          hemolysis workup
   -          repeat hct early afternoon.
   -
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Likely hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic
   patient.  Confusion with decreased attention; wife also reports ?neck
   drop (appears to be falling asleep), and gait difficulties in addition,
   but overall consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Lactulose 60 ml Q2 until BM, then back off.
   - Followup head CT.
   - Consider neurology consult if not improving.
   - Hold mood altering meds. Consider haldol if agitated.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Follows with Dr. [**Name (STitle) 2727**].
   - Liver aware and will follow.
   - Hold diuretics for now given hypotension.
   - Per wife, there had been some discussion of initiating transplant
   workup here (TTE, liver biopsy); will d/w liver team.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  With chills, mild hypothermia, concerning for
   infection/sepsis.  UA negative; CXR without infiltrate.  Has history of
   IVDU, at risk for endocarditis/bacteremia if still using (though family
   denies).  Also need to strongly consider possibility of SBP.
   - Blood, urine cultures.
   - Paracentesis via ultrasound guidance in AM
   - Cover with antibiotics as above.
   - Will treat for presumed SBP; in light of renal impairment will also
   given albumin today 1.5 g/kg; 1 g/kg on day 3 if SBP confirmed.
   .
   # Renal failure.  Unknown baseline (no priors at [**Hospital1 5**]).  Hypervolemic
   on exam, but likely intravascularly dry.  Also consider hepatorenal.
   Has been aggressively diuresed in last week or so, making prerenal
   likely.
   - Collateral information for baseline.
   - Urine lytes.
   - Bolus as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72).  Likely low baseline related to liver
   disease/portal hypertension and splenomegaly.  Also consider worsening
   related to DIC from infection, med effect.
   - Recheck CBC now
   - transfuse platelets if actively bleeding.
   .
   # Anemia.
   - recheck Hct now
   - guaiac stools.
   - folate, B12, TSH
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Hypervolemic hyponatermia with cirrhosis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   worsened by recent increase in diuretic dosing.
   - Hold diuresis; support volume status with NS.
   - Recheck in AM.
   .
   # Coagulopathy.  Likely elevation related to cirrhosis.
   - vitamin K x 3 day trial.

   diuretic dosing.
   - Recheck CBC now.
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics - vanc and aztreonam for now (will need to
   ensure aztreonam with appropriate penetration into peritoneum - prelim
   from pharmacy is okay).  Also add flagyl to provide anaerobic coverage.
   - Urine and blood cultures
   - CXR without infiltrate; reshoot film in AM following fluid
   resuscitation.
   - Stool for C.diff given recent antibiotic exposure.  Consider KUB.
   - TTE in AM - eval endocarditis or any valvular abnormality to explain
   decreased BP.
   - CVL in place, goal CVP 8-12, keep MAPs >60-65.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely hepatic encephalopathy, hypotension, and confusion. The patient has been admitted to the MICU due to these symptoms. The patient has a history of grade III varices and is at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. There are concerns for sepsis, as the patient has chills, leukocytosis, and hypothermia. The patient also has renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hyponatremia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and decreased attention span are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose has been prescribed to manage this condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of chills, leukocytosis, hypotension, and hypothermia suggest the possibility of sepsis. Blood and urine cultures have been ordered, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's history of grade III varices, there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Paracentesis has been planned to assess for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which can also cause bleeding.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and hypervolemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   57M with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely
   hepatic encephalopathy, admitted hypotensive requiring pressors, now
   improved.
   .
   # Hypotension. chills, leukocytosis, hypothermia in ED.  Concerning for
   sepsis.  Possible infectious sources include SBP.  No evidence of GIB
   though now with Hct drop.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have been dry from overdiuresis
   given recent increase in diuretic dosing.  Now off pressors.
   - follow hematocrits today.
   - Change antibiotics to SBP coverage alone
 ceftrixone; blood, urine,
   c.diff, pulmonary sources negative.
   - ?second albumin dose for SBP treatment (due tomorrow early AM
   hours).  No enough fluid to safely tap, but had para ~ 1 week ago.
   - Keep CVL for now..
   - Continue to hold lasix and propanolol for today given recent
   hypotension.
   - Can d/c steroids.
   .
   # Anemia.  Hct drop by 10 points since admission, ?baseline (38-39 here
   in past).  Guaiac positive but not grossly so.  Also with worsening
   thrombocytopenia and dropping WBC count.  Also consider
   hemolysis/[**Doctor First Name 2079**].  Bumped not quite appropriately to 1 unit PRBCs
   overnight.
   -          hemolysis workup
   -          repeat hct early afternoon.
   -          Stopping antibiotics, ?med effect leading to pancytopenia.
   -          Check peripheral smear.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic patient.
   - Lactulose TID plus prn to maintain at least [**1-26**] BM/day
   - ?why not on rifaximin
 will d/w liver.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Follows with Dr. [**Name (STitle) 2727**].
   - Liver following.
   - Resume diuretics tomorrow.
   .
   # Renal failure.  Now improved to 1.1.  Continue to follow.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72); past OSH admission with platelets in
   70-90 range.  Likely low baseline related to liver disease/portal
   hypertension and splenomegaly.  Worsening overnight - ?med effect vs.
   consumption vs. dilutional vs. DIC (INR also relatively up, though
   infection seems to be improving).
   - Recheck this afternoon.
   - stopping meds as above.
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Hypervolemic hyponatermia with cirrhosis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   worsened by recent increase in diuretic dosing.
   - Hold diuresis another day and continue to trend.
   .
   # Coagulopathy.  Likely elevation related to cirrhosis. Slight
   worsening with ?DIC as above.
   - vitamin K x 3 day trial.
   - recheck today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of COPD exacerbation and empiric treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, hypotension, and alterations in tissue perfusion. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 91/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the chief complaints mentioned.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of SBP and is currently being treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of developing other infections due to his immunocompromised state.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the 70s-90s.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has stable hyponatremia with sodium levels between 123-129 mg/dL.
6. Altered mental status: The patient presents with altered mental status, which can be a"

   # Hypotension. chills, leukocytosis, hypothermia in ED.  Concerning for
   sepsis.  Possible infectious sources include SBP.  No evidence of GIB
   though now with Hct drop.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have been dry from overdiuresis
   given recent increase in diuretic dosing.  Now off pressors.
   - follow hematocrits today.
   - Change antibiotics to SBP coverage alone
 ceftrixone; blood, urine,
   c.diff, pulmonary sources negative.
   - ?second albumin dose for SBP treatment (due tomorrow early AM
   hours).  No enough fluid to safely tap, but had para ~ 1 week ago.
   - Keep CVL for now..
   - Continue to hold lasix and propanolol for today given recent
   hypotension.
   - Can d/c steroids.
   .
   # Anemia.  Hct drop by 10 points since admission, ?baseline (38-39 here
   in past).  Guaiac positive but not grossly so.  Also with worsening
   thrombocytopenia and dropping WBC count.
   -          hemolysis workup
   -          repeat hct early afternoon.
   -          Stopping antibiotics, ?med effect leading to pancytopenia.
   -          Check peripheral smear.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presented with symptoms consistent with hepatic encephalopathy and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient's current condition is improved, but he still faces several potential medical complications.

1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which required the use of pressors for stabilization. Although the patient is now off pressors, ongoing monitoring and management of blood pressure is essential to prevent further episodes of hypotension.

2. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation included hypotension, chills, leukocytosis, and hypothermia, which raised concerns for sepsis. Possible infectious sources include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's recent increase in diuretic dosing may have contributed to dehydration, increasing the risk of infection. Close observation and prompt management of any signs of infection are crucial.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, a condition associated with liver cirrhosis. Treatment involves lactulose administration to reduce ammonia levels in the blood. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment accordingly.

4. Anemia and pancytopenia: The patient's hematocrit dropped significantly since admission, indicating anemia. Additionally, there is worsening thrombocytopenia and a dropping"

   57M with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely
   hepatic encephalopathy, now hypotensive requiring MICU admission. Now
   with improved mental status.
    Hypotension: no clear infectious source (no fluid to tap, but still
   concern for SBP and he conts on treatment, compounded by possible over
   diuresis.
   - Will narrow coverage to ceftriaxone,as it is not clear that he is
   actively infected. He may  have had SBP in the past (not clear from OSH
   records, clx neg) with plan to complete 7 day course.
   - Given recent prednisone exposure, start stress dose steroids -
   hydrocortisone 50 Q6H, would favor stopping this [**10-14**]
    >Progressive decrease in cell counts:  no clear source from above or
   below. Will check periph smear, d bili retic and haptoglobin for
   evidence of hemolysis. No active bleeding at this time (trace guiac +
   stool).  Seems very rapid for a med effect.  Plan for recheck of CBC
   this afternoon
   - recheck CBC, transfuse for Hct <25, plt <20 (unless active bleeding0
   >Altered MS:   Likely hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic
   patient, improvement with lactulose now A+O x 3
   - standing lactulose, consider addition of rifaximin
   >Liver failure:  thought to be [**12-26**] HepC and EtOH with transaminitis and
   increased alk phos and bilirubin, no evidence of obstruction on the
   RUQ. His transaminitis conts to improve.
   - Liver aware and will follow. Hep C viral load
   - Hold diuretics for now given hypotension recently and consider
   restart within the next 24 hrs.
   > Renal failure.  Unknown baseline (no priors at [**Hospital1 5**]).  Hypervolemic
   on exam, but likely intravascularly dry.  Also consider hepatorenal.
   Has been aggressively diuresed in last week or so, making prerenal
   likely with improvement in to 1.2 with hydration. Una is difficult to
   interpret in the setting of recent lasix dosing. He has improved
   markedly with gentle hydration
   > Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72).  Likely low baseline related to liver
   disease/portal hypertension and splenomegaly.  Also consider worsening
   related to DIC from infection, med effect (aztreonam and PPI)
   - F/u total protein and cyroglobulin
   - transfuse platelets if actively bleeding.
    > Coagulopathy.  Likely elevation related to cirrhosis.
   - vitamin K x 3 day trial.
   - Continue to trend; FFP if evidence of active bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and suspected hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status has improved, and his hypotension has resolved. He is currently receiving albumin therapy and antibiotics for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient was intermittently hypotensive before admission, requiring MICU admission. Although his hypotension has resolved, there is still concern for SBP and the possibility of overdiuresis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient likely has hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by his altered mental status. Treatment with lactulose has improved his condition, and further management with rifaximin may be considered.

3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests indicate liver failure, likely due to hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. Repeat testing of liver enzymes and viral load is recommended. Monitoring for signs of hepatic encephalopathy and portal hypertension is also important.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline renal function is unknown, but he has shown improvement in renal parameters with gentle hydration. Hypervolemia and the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome should be considered. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely hepatic encephalopathy, intermittently hypotensive requiring MICU admission. The patient's mental status has improved, and his hypotension has resolved. The patient's current condition includes no clear infectious source, possible overdiuresis, and concerns for SBP. The plan is to narrow coverage to ceftriaxone and complete a 7-day course, day 1=[**10-12**]. Albumin therapy will also be continued for SBP. Steroids have been stopped.

The patient has a progressive decrease in Hct, with no clear source from above or below. A peripheral smear, DBIL, and haptoglobin will be checked for evidence of hemolysis. The patient does not appear to be reticulating. His ferritin is high, possibly suggestive of hemochromatosis. B12 and folate levels are normal.

Other assessments include altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy in a known cirrhotic patient, improvement with lactulose. Lactulose will be continued, and rifaximin may be added. The patient is thought to have liver failure from hepatitis C and EtOH, with transaminitis and increased alk phos and bilirubin. There is no evidence of obstruction on the RUQ. His transaminitis continues to improve. His"

   hypotension
    >Hypotension: no clear infectious source (no fluid to tap, but still
   concern for SBP and he conts on treatment, compounded by possible over
   diuresis.
   - Will narrow coverage to ceftriaxone,as it is not clear that he is
   actively infected. He may  have had SBP in the past (not clear from OSH
   records, clx neg) with plan to complete 7 day course, day 1=[**10-12**].  He
   is receiving albumin therapy as well for his SBP.
   - Steroids stopped
    >Progressive decrease Hct:  no clear source from above or below. Will
   check periph smear, d bili retic and haptoglobin for evidence of
   hemolysis. No active bleeding at this time (trace guiac + stool).
   Seems very rapid for a med effect.  Plan for recheck of CBC this
   afternoon. He does not appear to be retic
ng,. His ferritin is quite
   high possibly suggestive of possible hemachromatosis. Notably B12 and
   folate normal.
   - recheck CBC, transfuse for Hct <25, plt <20 (unless active bleeding0
   >Altered MS:   Likely hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic
   patient, improvement with lactulose now A+O x 3.
   - standing lactulose, consider addition of rifaximin
   >Liver failure:  thought to be [**12-26**] HepC and EtOH with transaminitis and
   increased alk phos and bilirubin, no evidence of obstruction on the
   RUQ. His transaminitis conts to improve.   His AFP may warrant repeat
   testing despite his previous hx of elevated AFP. His elevated ferritin
   is also interesting concerning for hemachromatosis
   - Liver aware and will follow. Hep C viral load
   - Hold diuretics for now given hypotension recently and consider
   restart within the next 24 hrs.
   > Renal failure.  Unknown baseline (no priors at [**Hospital1 5**]).  Hypervolemic
   on exam, but likely intravascularly dry.  Also consider hepatorenal.
   Has been aggressively diuresed in last week or so, making prerenal
   likely with improvement in to 1.2 with hydration. Una is difficult to
   interpret in the setting of recent lasix dosing. He has improved
   markedly with gentle hydration
   > Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72).  Likely low baseline related to liver
   disease/portal hypertension and splenomegaly.  Also consider worsening
   related to DIC from infection, med effect (aztreonam and PPI).  It is
   difficult to determine whether this DIC in the setting of his liver
   failure, we will continue to trend. We have stopped potentially
   offending medications and his plts [**10-15**] are no worse.
   - F/u total protein and cyroglobulin
   - transfuse platelets if actively bleeding.
   - cont to follow DIC
   - change back to omeprazole (? Lansoprazole with higher incidence of
   thromb)
    > Coagulopathy.  Likely elevation related to cirrhosis.
   - vitamin K x 3 day trial.
   - Continue to trend; FFP if evidence of active bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He presented with likely hepatic encephalopathy, intermittent hypotension, and was admitted to the MICU. His mental status has improved, and his hypotension has resolved. The patient is currently being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including ceftriaxone. He is also receiving albumin therapy for SBP.

The patient's hemoglobin levels have been progressively decreasing, and there is no clear source of blood loss. Further investigations are planned to check for evidence of hemolysis. The patient's ferritin level is high, which may suggest possible hemochromatosis.

The patient has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. He has shown improvement with lactulose treatment, and rifaximin may be added as well. The patient's liver function tests indicate liver failure, possibly related to hepatitis C and alcohol use, with elevated transaminase levels and bilirubin. Further monitoring and testing are planned.

The patient's renal function is difficult to interpret due to recent diuretic use, but he has shown improvement with gentle hydration. Thrombocytopenia is present, which could be related to liver disease, portal hypertension, splenomegaly, or medication effects. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, likely related to cir"

   actively infected. He may  have had SBP in the past (not clear from OSH
   records, clx neg) with plan to complete 7 day course, day 1=[**10-12**].  He
   is receiving albumin therapy as well for his SBP.
   - Steroids stopped
    >Progressive decrease Hct:  no clear source from above or below. Will
   check periph smear, d bili retic and haptoglobin for evidence of
   hemolysis. No active bleeding at this time (trace guiac + stool).
   Seems very rapid for a med effect.  Plan for recheck of CBC this
   afternoon. He does not appear to be retic
ng,. His ferritin is quite
   high possibly suggestive of possible hemachromatosis. Notably B12 and
   folate normal.
   - recheck CBC, transfuse for Hct <25, plt <20 (unless active bleeding0
   >Altered MS:   Likely hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic
   patient, improvement with lactulose now A+O x 3.
   - standing lactulose, consider addition of rifaximin
   >Liver failure:  thought to be [**12-26**] HepC and EtOH with transaminitis and
   increased alk phos and bilirubin, no evidence of obstruction on the
   RUQ. His transaminitis conts to improve.   His AFP may warrant repeat
   testing despite his previous hx of elevated AFP. His elevated ferritin
   is also interesting concerning for hemachromatosis
   - Liver aware and will follow. Hep C viral load
   - Hold diuretics for now given hypotension recently and consider
   restart within the next 24 hrs.
   > Renal failure.  Unknown baseline (no priors at [**Hospital1 5**]).  Hypervolemic
   on exam, but likely intravascularly dry.  Also consider hepatorenal.
   Has been aggressively diuresed in last week or so, making prerenal
   likely with improvement in to 1.2 with hydration. Una is difficult to
   interpret in the setting of recent lasix dosing. He has improved
   markedly with gentle hydration
   > Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72).  Likely low baseline related to liver
   disease/portal hypertension and splenomegaly.  Also consider worsening
   related to DIC from infection, med effect (aztreonam and PPI).  It is
   difficult to determine whether this DIC in the setting of his liver
   failure, we will continue to trend. We have stopped potentially
   offending medications and his plts [**10-15**] are no worse.
   - F/u total protein and cyroglobulin
   - transfuse platelets if actively bleeding.
   - cont to follow DIC
   - change back to omeprazole (? Lansoprazole with higher incidence of
   thromb)
    > Coagulopathy.  Likely elevation related to cirrhosis.
   - vitamin K x 3 day trial.
   - Continue to trend; FFP if evidence of active bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely hepatic encephalopathy, intermittently hypotensive requiring MICU admission. The patient's mental status has improved and resolution of hypotension. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to an infectious source such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended, and albumin therapy will be continued for SBP.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose will be continued, and rifaximin may be added as a standing medication.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests indicate liver failure, possibly related to hepatitis C and alcohol use. Close monitoring of liver function is advised, and repeat testing for Hep C viral load and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is recommended.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, possibly due to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. Gentle hydration will be continued, and diuretics may be restarted within the next 24 hours.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is likely related to liver disease/portal hypertension and possible medication effects. Monitoring of total protein and cryoglobulin levels is"

   57M with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely
   hepatic encephalopathy, admitted hypotensive requiring pressors, now
   improved.
   .
   # Hypotension. chills, leukocytosis, hypothermia in ED.  Concerning for
   sepsis.  Possible infectious sources include SBP.  No evidence of GIB
   though now with Hct drop.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have been dry from overdiuresis
   given recent increase in diuretic dosing.  Now off pressors.  Blood, ,
   urine, c.diff, pulmonary sources negative.
   - follow hematocrits Q12H.
   - Antibiotics for SBP coverage
 ceftriaxone plus albumin (last dose
   today).
   - Keep CVL for now, d/c if gets good PIV access.
   - Continue to hold lasix and propanolol for today.
   .
   # Anemia.  Hct drop by 10 points since admission, ?baseline (38-39 here
   in past).  Guaiac positive but not grossly so.  Also with worsening
   thrombocytopenia.  Also consider hemolysis/[**Doctor First Name 2079**], med
   effect/antibiotics.  Bumped not quite appropriately to 1 unit PRBCs 2
   days ago, but has since maintained Hct.
   -          repeat HCT this afternoon.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72); past OSH admission with platelets in
   70-90 range.  Likely low baseline related to liver disease/portal
   hypertension and splenomegaly.  Worsening 2 days ago - ?med effect vs.
   consumption vs. dilutional vs. DIC (fibrinogen low, but baseline
   unknown; FDP low).
   - Recheck this afternoon.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic patient.
   - Lactulose TID plus prn to maintain at least [**1-26**] BM/day
   - ?why not on rifaximin
 will d/w liver.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Follows with Dr. [**Name (STitle) 2727**].
   - Liver following.
   - Hold diuretics another day.
   .
   # Renal failure.  Now improved to baseline.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual with no acute distress. The patient has a history of renal failure, liver function abnormalities, pancytopenia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, altered mental status, and alteration in tissue perfusion. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/44 mmHg to 75/25 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, with a total fluid input of 1,768 mL and output of 2,155 mL, resulting in a balance of -387 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has clear breath sounds. The patient's abdominal examination reveals a distended abdomen with soft, non-tender bowel sounds. Extremity assessment shows 2+ edema in both lower extremities. The patient's neurologic examination indicates that they are attentive, follow simple commands, respond appropriately, and are oriented. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 35 K/uL, low platelet count of 97 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormalities in liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with renal failure, liver function abnormalities"

   57M with history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, presenting with likely
   hepatic encephalopathy, admitted hypotensive requiring pressors, now
   improved.
   .
   # Hypotension. chills, leukocytosis, hypothermia in ED.  Concerning for
   sepsis.  Possible infectious sources include SBP.  No evidence of GIB
   though now with Hct drop.  [**Month (only) 8**] also have been dry from overdiuresis
   given recent increase in diuretic dosing.  Now off pressors.
   - follow hematocrits today.
   - Change antibiotics to SBP coverage alone
 ceftrixone; blood, urine,
   c.diff, pulmonary sources negative.
   - ?second albumin dose for SBP treatment (due tomorrow early AM
   hours).  No enough fluid to safely tap, but had para ~ 1 week ago.
   - Keep CVL for now..
   - Continue to hold lasix and propanolol for today given recent
   hypotension.
   - Can d/c steroids.
   .
   # Anemia.  Hct drop by 10 points since admission, ?baseline (38-39 here
   in past).  Guaiac positive but not grossly so.  Also with worsening
   thrombocytopenia and dropping WBC count.  Also consider
   hemolysis/[**Doctor First Name 2079**].  Bumped not quite appropriately to 1 unit PRBCs
   overnight.
   -          hemolysis workup
   -          repeat hct early afternoon.
   -          Stopping antibiotics, ?med effect leading to pancytopenia.
   -          Check peripheral smear.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Hepatic encephalopathy in known cirrhotic patient.
   - Lactulose TID plus prn to maintain at least [**1-26**] BM/day
   - ?why not on rifaximin
 will d/w liver.
   .
   # Cirrhosis.  Follows with Dr. [**Name (STitle) 2727**].
   - Liver following.
   - Resume diuretics tomorrow.
   .
   # Renal failure.  Now improved to 1.1.  Continue to follow.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline low platelet counts (117-123 in past)
   with worsening at admission (72); past OSH admission with platelets in
   70-90 range.  Likely low baseline related to liver disease/portal
   hypertension and splenomegaly.  Worsening overnight - ?med effect vs.
   consumption vs. dilutional vs. DIC (INR also relatively up, though
   infection seems to be improving).
   - Recheck this afternoon.
   - stopping meds as above.
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Hypervolemic hyponatermia with cirrhosis.  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   worsened by recent increase in diuretic dosing.
   - Hold diuresis another day and continue to trend.
   .
   # Coagulopathy.  Likely elevation related to cirrhosis. Slight
   worsening with ?DIC as above.
   - vitamin K x 3 day trial.
   - recheck today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He was admitted hypotensive and required pressors for blood pressure support. The patient's condition has improved, and he no longer requires pressors. He is currently being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with ceftriaxone and has a central venous line (CVL) in place. 

The patient has shown a drop in hematocrit since admission, as well as worsening thrombocytopenia and a decreasing white blood cell count. A hemolysis workup is pending, and the patient received one unit of packed red blood cells overnight. 

The patient is also experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, for which he is receiving lactulose and may be considered for rifaximin. His liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. 

The patient has a history of anemia, with a baseline hematocrit of 38-39%. He is also showing signs of renal failure, although his creatinine level has improved to 1.1. 

The patient's platelet count has been low, likely due to liver disease or portal hypertension. There are concerns about possible medication effects, consumption, dilutional causes, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient is also dealing with hyponatremia, worsened by recent increases in di"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 2807**] is a 57 year old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted
   for altered mental status secondary to hepatic encephalopathy and
   hypotension requiring pressors.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient initially admitted to hypotension, chills,
   leukocytosis, hypothermia, concerning for sepsis.  No positive
   cultures, though treated empicirally for SBP given small ascites and
   abdominal pain.  Having gaiac positive stool, but not significant
   enough to result in hypotension.  Had low grade fever overnight.
   - follow hematocrits Q12H.
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP
   - Keep CVL for now, d/c if gets good PIV access.
   - Continue to hold lasix and propanolol for today.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   2.       Positive UA.  Patient has a positive UA, but cultures are
   pending.  Already on ceftriaxone, so will not change antibiotics at
   present.
   -          f/u urine culture
   .
   3.  Low grade fever.  Patient had temperature to 100.5 overnight.  No
   leukcotyosis.  Positive UA, but on ceftriaxone.  All other cultures
   negative.  Being treated empirically for SBP with ceftriaxone.
   - f/u cultlures
   - follow fever curve, WBC
   2.  Anemia.  Hct dropped on hospital day 2 by 10 point in setting of
   aggressive hydration.  Stools were trace guaiac positive.  In addition,
   patient had worsening thrombocytopenia.  Low hapto and rising T. bili
   could be consistent with hemolysis, but difficult to interpret in liver
   patient.. DIC labs slightly worsening today.  However, Hct has been
   stable.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   3.       Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline platelets last week at OSH were
   70s to 90s, now with falling platelet count.   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to worsening
   liver disease and splenomegaly versus diluntional (Cr down from 1.6 to
   0.9).   Other possibilities are med effect, consumption, DIC.
   - trend platelets
   .
   4.  Encephalopathy.  Initially admitted with altered mental status
   secondary to hepatic encephalopthay which improved with lactlose.
   - Lactulose TID plus prn to maintain at least [**1-26**] BM/day
   .
   5.  Cirrhosis.  Follows with Dr. [**Name (STitle) 2727**].
   - Liver following.
   - Hold diuretics another day.

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted for altered mental status secondary to hepatic encephalopathy and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient initially presented with hypotension, chills, leukocytosis, hypothermia, concerning for sepsis. No positive cultures were found, so the patient was treated empirically for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) given the small amount of ascites and abdominal pain.

The patient has a positive urinalysis (UA), but cultures are pending. The patient is already on ceftriaxone, so there is no need to change antibiotics at present. The patient's temperature reached 100.5 overnight, and he has been treated empirically for SBP with ceftriaxone. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped by 10 points on hospital day 2 while receiving aggressive hydration. The patient also has worsening thrombocytopenia, with a low platelet count. The patient's liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.

The patient is experiencing anemia, with a significant drop in Hct. The patient's stools are trace guaiac positive, indicating the presence of blood. This could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's thrombocytopenia is worsening, with a decreasing platelet count. Other possible causes for the low platelet count include worsening liver disease and splen"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing worsening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), subjective dyspnea, and wheezing. Vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and oxygen saturation in the mid to upper 90s on RA with the use of a nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates fluid balance with a net intake of 2,230 mL and output of 992 mL over 24 hours. The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics but has not shown improvement. Lab results show elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of renal dysfunction. The patient's WBC count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count are trending down. The patient is on gentle hydration for acute renal failure, and liver function test trends are improving with encephalopathy. The patient has pancytopenia and is at risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The altered mental status has resolved, but there are concerns about alterations in tissue perfusion and hypotension. The patient is receiving ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU with a full code status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted for altered mental status secondary to hepatic encephalopathy and hypotension requiring pressors. The patient initially presented with hypotension, chills, leukocytosis, hypothermia, and concern for sepsis. No positive cultures were found, but the patient was treated empirically for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) due to small ascites and abdominal pain. The patient also has a positive urinalysis (UA) with both white and red blood cells, but cultures are pending. The patient is currently on ceftriaxone for SBP. Additionally, the patient has a low-grade fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, encephalopathy, and cirrhosis. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU with various interventions and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial admission included hypotension, which required the use of pressors. This indicates a possible cardiovascular issue or septic shock.
2. Sepsis: The initial presentation of hypotension, chills, and leukocytosis raises concern for sepsis. The patient was treated empirically for SBP, suggesting a possible infection.
3. SBP: The patient's treatment with ceftriaxone indicates a suspicion of SBP, a common infection in cirrhotic"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old male with hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted for altered mental
   status secondary to hepatic encephalopathy and hypotension requiring
   pressors.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient initially admitted to hypotension, chills,
   leukocytosis, hypothermia, concerning for sepsis.  No positive
   cultures, though treated empicirally for SBP given small ascites and
   abdominal pain.  Having gaiac positive stool, but not significant
   enough to result in hypotension.  Had low grade fever overnight.
   - follow hematocrits Q12H.
   - Ceftriaxone for SBP
   - Continue to hold lasix and propanolol for today.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   2.       Positive UA.  Patient has a positive UA, but cultures are
   pending.  Already on ceftriaxone, so will not change antibiotics at
   present.
   -          f/u urine culture
   .
   3.  Low grade fever.  Patient had temperature to 100.5 overnight.  No
   leukcotyosis.  Positive UA, but on ceftriaxone.  All other cultures
   negative.  Being treated empirically for SBP with ceftriaxone.
   - f/u cultlures
   - follow fever curve, WBC
   2.  Anemia.  Hct dropped on hospital day 2 by 10 point in setting of
   aggressive hydration.  Stools were trace guaiac positive.  Likely
   dilution plus small amounts of bleeding in setting of hepatic
   coaglatopathy (trace guiaic positive stools, epistaxis, phlebotomy).
   Low hapto and rising T. bili could be consistent with hemolysis, but
   difficult to interpret in liver patient.. DIC labs stable.   Hct has
   been stable.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   3.       Thrombocytopenia.  Baseline platelets last week at OSH were
   70s to 90s, now with falling platelet count.   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to worsening
   liver disease and splenomegaly versus diluntional (Cr down from 1.6 to
   0.9).   Other possibilities are med effect, consumption, DIC.
   Received platelet transfusion in AM for epistaxis.
   - trend platelets
   .
   4.  Encephalopathy.  Initially admitted with altered mental status
   secondary to hepatic encephalopthay which improved with lactlose.
   - Lactulose TID plus prn to maintain at least [**1-26**] BM/day
   .
   5.  Cirrhosis.  Follows with Dr. [**Name (STitle) 2727**].
   - Liver following.
   - Hold diuretics another day.
