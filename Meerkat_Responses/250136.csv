   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   73 yo M with a history of afib, L MCA stroke, recurrent seizures who
   initally presented after witnessed seizure, now transferred to the MICU
   with tachycardia and hypotension.
   .
   1. Tachycardia and hypotension: Patient initally hypertensive in the
   ED, and has been getting metoprolol and Hydralazine for hypertension.
   Now intubated, on sedatives, and hypotensives. Differential includes
   hypovolemia, medication effect, hypotension secondary to Afib with RVR,
   PE, MI, sepsis. Given that inital hypotensive episode was this morning
   in the context of a rapid heart rate in the 150s, Afib is likely
   etiology. However, given concern for LE thrombus yesterday which seems
   to have resolved, tachypnea requiring intubation, PE is on the
   differential. CTA was defered given Acute renal failure, which is
   resolving. Sepsis is possible since patient had a fever of 100.8 in the
   ED. However since admission patient has remained afebrile. It is
   reassuring that CSF results do not support infection.
   -continue heparin gtt empirically for PE
   -consider CTA this evening or tomorrow as renal function improves
   -obtain LENI of LLE (R negative)
   -consider echo
   -control atrial fibrillation with amiodarone gtt
   -start low dose po metoprolol for rate control. Wean up as BP
   tolerates.
   -rule out MI
   -rule out infection: obtain urine culture, follow up blood cultures,
   follow up CSF cultures
   -culture if spikes; consider antibiotic coverage. Would hold off for
   now given no localizing sources of infection.
   .
   2. Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for tachypnea in the ER.
   Currently with good O2 saturations on PS 5/5. Would favor extubation to
   avoid sedating medications that may be contributing to hypotension.
   -d/c Propofol
   -optimize for extubation
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 0.9. Cr on admission was 2.0, down
   to 1.6 today. Would consider CTA tomorrow assuming renal function woudl
   improve further. However if becomes tachycardic or hypoxic, could
   consider CTA earlier.
   -obtain urine lytes
   -avoid nephrotoxins; renally dose medications
   .
   #. Seizures: Patient with recurrent seizure disorder. EEG performed
   shows no seizure activity since admission.
   -Continue Tegretol 300mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Disontinue Ativan 1mg IV BID
   -f/u neurology recs
   .
   # h/o MCA stroke:
   -continue plavix, pravastatin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Concern for hyperemic RLE: RLE hyperemic in the ED. R LENI negative.
   Vascular evaluated the patient and has signed off. Currently both LEs
   have good circulation and pulses.
   -continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, left middle cerebral artery stroke, recurrent seizures, and hypertension. He presented to the emergency department after experiencing a witnessed seizure and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to tachycardia and hypotension. The patient has been intubated, sedated, and placed on hypotensive medications. Initial blood pressure readings showed hypertension but have now stabilized in the normal range. The patient's renal function has improved, and he is no longer in acute renal failure. However, he remains at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial infarction (MI), and sepsis. The patient's respiratory status improved with intubation and is currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Tachycardia and hypotension: The patient's initial hypertensive episode in the emergency department and subsequent administration of metoprolol and hydralazine suggest that atrial fibrillation may be the underlying cause. However, given the concern for left external iliac thrombus yesterday, which seems to have resolved, pulmonary embolism is also on the differential. The decision to proceed with a CT angiogram (CTA) will depend on the patient's renal function, which is improving. Sepsis is possible, but the patient has remained afebrile since admission, and CSF"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo M with a history of afib, L MCA stroke, recurrent seizures who
   initally presented after witnessed seizure, now transferred to the MICU
   with tachycardia and hypotension. Likely neurologic given primary
   presenting complaint AMS. Will obtain MR [**First Name (Titles) 1646**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11359**] stable.
   #. Tachycardia and hypotension
   Still in AF with some rate control of otherwise RVR with diltiazem PO.
   Pressures now better. LENIs negative and no little suspicion for PE
   would not explain seizure and AMS, and hemodynamic fluctuations not
   consistent with.
   -continue heparin gtt empirically for PE
   - Increase diltaizem to 45 mg QID (from 30 mg)
   #. AMS
   Likely brainstem stroke given possible emboli to left leg,
   hypertension, seizure, posturing of limbs. Not evident on CT but this
   was early and posturing of left arm more consistent with subcortical
   infarction. Therefore MRI with stroke protocol as above. Not likely
   that seizures are contributing given that these were not seen before
   and are typically motor.
   - Continue to hold sedating medications
   - NR as above when stable
   - Continue anticonvulsants
   - Restart EEG monitoring after MRI
   - Appreciate Neuro recs
   # Acute renal failure
   Improving. Possible embolic now on heparin and improving. Versus
   prerenal with increased viscosity and dislodging of clot or increased
   clotting in small vessel. Possible component of etiology.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   -avoid nephrotoxins; renally dose medications
   #. Seizures
   Patient with recurrent seizure disorder. EEG performed shows no seizure
   activity since admission. Continue Mx as above
   -Continue Tegretol 300mg [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, left middle cerebral artery stroke, and recurrent seizures. He presented with a witnessed seizure and altered mental status, and was initially treated in the emergency department. He was then transferred to the MICU due to tachycardia and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/59 mmHg to 180/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and irregularly irregular rhythm on cardiac monitoring.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated, with pale and clearly hemiparetic appearance. Neurological examination shows non-responsive behavior, eye opening without fixation or movement, no response to voice, completely non-verbal, and reflexive bodily movements when being moved around. The patient also exhibits rigidity in the right leg and left upper limb, with flaccidity in the left leg.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin T level. Other laboratory values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's initial assessment includes tachycardia and hypotension, likely due to a neurologic cause given the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of seizure and altered mental status. The MRI findings indicate an acute infarct involving the entire right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory with a small amount of hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe. There is also a mass effect on the right lateral ventricle and a 4mm right to left midline shift with near complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/62 mmHg to 151/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and other abnormal values such as troponin-T, lactate, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Imaging shows a new stroke in the right MCA territory with a very small preserved cortex at the midline.

The patient's conditions and potential complications include:
1. CVA (stroke) due to cerebral infarction.
2. Hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and a previous left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. He presented with a witnessed seizure and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for tachycardia and hypotension. The patient now has a full right MCA territory stroke, with only viable cortex supplied by the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries on the right. No meaningful recovery is expected, and the family is considering transitioning to comfort measures only (CMO). The patient is currently do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia and hypotension: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored closely. If the blood pressure exceeds 200 mmHg, hydralazine can be administered to control it. The stroke team recommends allowing the blood pressure to autoregulate.
2. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient's altered mental status is secondary to a very large cortical infarction with significant loss of cortical function. Sedating medications should be continued, anticonvulsants should be continued, and neurology recommendations should be followed. Further discussion with the family is needed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function should continue to be monitored. Maintenance fluids should be given, and nephrotoxins should be avoided. Renally dos"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, and recurrent seizures. He initially presented with a witnessed seizure and was transferred to the MICU due to tachycardia and hypotension. Upon examination, he was found to have a full right MCA territory stroke with viable cortex supplied by the anterior cerebral and posterior cerebral arteries on the right. No meaningful recovery is expected, and the family agrees with plans to transition to comfort measures only (CMO). The patient is currently DNR/do not re-intubate.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/75 to 88/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and sedated, with clear lung sounds bilaterally. His neurologic examination shows that he is non-responsive, only opening his eyes without fixation or movement. There are no responses to voice, and he is completely non-verbal. Reflexive bodily movements occur when being moved around, and he has rigidity in the upper limbs with right-sided predominance. The lower limbs show flaccidity on the left side and rigidity on the right side.

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, recurrent seizures, and now presents with a full right MCA territory stroke. The patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO) due to no meaningful recovery expected.

The patient initially presented after a witnessed seizure and was transferred to the MICU with tachycardia and hypotension. Upon evaluation, the patient was found to have a very large cortical infarction with greater loss of cortical function. The likely etiology of the patient's seizure presentation and altered mental status (AMS) is the large cortical infarction.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 160 bpm (tachycardia), blood pressure ranging from 107/63 mmHg to 171/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute (controlled due to mechanical ventilation), and oxygen saturation of 65%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Troponin-T is elevated at 0.11, suggesting some cardiac injury. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is sedated, appears comfortable, and is pale and clearly hemiparetic. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and his abdomen is soft, non"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, and recurrent seizures.
- He initially presented with a witnessed seizure and was transferred to the MICU due to tachycardia and hypotension.
- The patient has full right MCA territory stroke with viable cortex supplied by the anterior cerebral and posterior cerebral on the right. No meaningful recovery is expected.
- The patient has been made comfort measures only (CMO).
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 160 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/63 mmHg to 171/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 65%.
- The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF).
- Fluid balance shows an input of 1,417 mL and output of 515 mL, resulting in a balance of 902 mL.
- The patient is not receiving respiratory support.
- Physical examination shows the patient to be sedated, pale, and clearly hemiparetic. He is nonresponsive, with only eye opening without fixation or movements on physical stimulation. No response to voice is observed. The patient has rigid and wasted right leg, left more flaccid, and upper limbs rigid R > L.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and other abnormal values.
- Radiology findings show no interval change in the chest X-ray.
- The patient's assessment and plan include right MCA stroke, autonomic lability, atrial fibrillation episode, acute renal failure, seizures, and comfort measures only.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: Due to the patient's sedation and inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia or other respiratory infections.

2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the current episode of AF increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism or stroke.

3. Renal complications: The acute renal failure and the use of nephrotoxic medications may lead to further deterioration of renal function.

4. Seizure complications: With the patient's history of recurrent seizures and the recent large cortical infarction, there is a risk of recurrent seizures or status epilepticus.

5. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and decreased sensation due to stroke increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

6. Infection: Due to the patient's weakened immune system and prolonged immobility, there is an increased risk of developing infections such as urinary tract infections or wound infections.

7. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism: Immobil"
