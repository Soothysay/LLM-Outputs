   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is VRE bacteremia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and pancytopenia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions.

The patient has multiple lines placed, including a PICC line, midline, and dialysis catheter. They are also receiving an insulin drip for improved serum glucose levels and are being transfused with RBCs and platelets per oncology protocol.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm and elevated blood pressure ranging from 157/87 mmHg to 186/109 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 93% without supplemental oxygen. Respiratory support is not required.

Physical examination reveals slight oozing at the site of the triple lumen placed in the internal jugular vein. The patient appears well-nourished, overweight, and has scleral edema. There are no signs of endotracheal or nasogastric tubes, but there is alopecia noted. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and distant S2 heart sound. The patient has 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema but no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination indicates that the patient is sedated and responds to tactile stimuli.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL,"

   Renal function improved significantly over past 36 hours. Significant

   Mental status better this morning; patient able to follow simple
   commands.
   Patient has respiratory alkalosis, possibly related to discomfort. She
   has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is probably a
   compensation for the respiratory alkalosis. No diarrhea. Oxygenation in
   good range.
   Insulin being adjusted to maintain serum glucose in range.
   Blood pressure remains high on hydralazine. Check with renal about
   using IV ACE inhibitor. If that is not an option, consider clonidine
   patch.
   Continues with abdominal pain, likely from the VOD. Checking stool for
   C diff. Bilirubin continues to rise. Will ask liver service to consult.
   LDH up; check smear for schistocytes.
   Continue to support blood counts with transfusions per protocol.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These potential complications include:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are persistently high, indicating uncontrolled diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia. This may require adjustment of insulin infusion to maintain serum glucose within a normal range.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This condition increases the risk of bleeding, infection, and anemia. Supportive care with transfusions is being provided per oncology protocol.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved significantly over the past 36 hours, likely due to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). However, the patient still shows signs of acute renal failure, which may require ongoing management and monitoring.

4. Lymphoma: The patient has a diagnosis of lymphoma, a type of cancer affecting the lymphatic system. Treatment for this condition will be necessary and may involve chemotherapy or other specific interventions.

5. Acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely a compensatory response to respiratory alkalosis caused by discomfort. Further evaluation and management of acid-base balance is needed.

6. Pleural effusion: The patient has a probable right pleural effusion as indicated by imaging. This may require drainage and analysis of the fluid to determine the underlying"

 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - will increase lantus per insulin gtt requirement over last 24 hours
   and transition to SSI
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.  ANC this
   morning
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   -
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # ? Line infection:
   - Cont daptomycin and zosyn
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.

   transplantation of a double cord, now transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT
   yesterday.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   # Hyperglycemia - Likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.
   - continue insulin gtt, titrate to FSBG 100-151, FS Q1 H, will monitor
   insulin requirements to eventually wean of insulin gtt whilst
   increasing Lantus
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +17 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - Will discuss with Heme-Onc to clarify frequency of lab draws
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - will start defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150,
   yesterday her Hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt
   unfortunately does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer
   acting antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers - Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and
   mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ
   line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC),
   PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for
   better anaerobe coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in
   the low 100s, pt was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
   tachycardia appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is
   currently on immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether
   tachycardia may be a sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low
   threhold and obtain surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures
   were drawn three days ago.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - send surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Patient denies any current symptoms
   (diarrhea and abdominal pain), currently one C. diff has been sent

   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen

 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # ? Line infection:
   - Cont daptomycin and zosyn
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She is currently in the ICU for the initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia. The patient has several medical complications including acute renal failure, presumed VOD, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, fevers, C. difficile colitis, mucositis, and an intragluteal folds rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and the need for CRRT. This could lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
2. Presumed Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD): The patient presents with RUQ pain, ascites, and potential reversal of portal blood flow. VOD is a serious complication that can lead to liver dysfunction and multiorgan failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. This can be exacerbated by chemotherapy and may require platelet transfusions.
4. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure, which needs to be controlled to prevent end-organ damage.
5. Fevers: The patient has been febrile, indicating a possible infection. It is important to identify the source of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions. These include acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, lymphoma (cancer), hyperbilirubinemia, pancytopenia with neutropenic fever, VRE infection, and hypertension. The patient is currently receiving various treatments and interventions for these conditions. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, uncontrolled blood sugar levels, progression of lymphoma, complications related to vascular occlusive disease (VOD), further development of infections such as bacterial or fungal infections, and the management of hypertension. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and overall clinical condition to address any emerging complications promptly."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of lymphoma, chronic pain, and renal failure, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been receiving various treatments including RRT (renal replacement therapy), pain medication, insulin for hyperglycemia, and antibiotics for VRE infection. The patient also has a PICC line, midline, and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is currently receiving RRT. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and kidney function parameters such as creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and prevent further deterioration of renal function.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Continuous insulin infusion is being administered to control blood sugar levels. It is important to monitor the patient's response to insulin therapy and adjust the dosage accordingly to maintain optimal glycemic control.

3. Lymphoma (Cancer): The patient has a history of lymphoma, and current treatment includes immune regimen and defibrotide protocol. Regular follow-up with the hematology service is essential to evaluate the response to therapy and monitor for any complications related to cancer treatment.

4. Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD): VOD is a potential complication of stem cell transplantation"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - will increase lantus per insulin gtt requirement over last 24 hours
   and transition to SSI
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.  ANC this
   morning
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   -
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.

She underwent ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications including acute kidney injury (ARF) with a likely etiology of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity, thrombocytopenia likely due to chemotherapy, presumed veno-occlusive disease (VOD) treated with defibrotide, hypertension, fevers, and Clostridium difficile colitis.

The patient is currently on several medications including vancomycin, daptomycin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and caspofungin. She is also receiving insulin gtt for glycemic control and pain medication as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has ongoing renal dysfunction requiring CRRT. The cause of ARF is suspected to be a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications are necessary.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistently low platelet counts likely due to chemotherapy. Platelet transfusions may be required to maintain a target platelet count of 30,"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # ? Line infection:
   - Cont daptomycin and zosyn
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33
   - renal recs to continues CVVH
   - patient with only minimal agitation - managed well with pain
   medication and ativan
   - Lantus increased to 50 units qd, off insulin gtt, on humalog sliding
   scale with q2h fingersticks and q6h SSI dosing per endocrine

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who underwent ablative chemotherapy and cord blood transplantation. She was admitted to the ICU for the initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and management of hyperglycemia. The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute kidney injury (ARF) possibly due to a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity, presumed veno-occlusive disease (VOD), thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and hypothermia. She also has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis, mucositis, intragluteal folds rash, nausea, bone pain, and contact precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient is experiencing ARF, which is likely secondary to a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. She requires ongoing renal support and monitoring.

2. Presumed Veno-occlusive Disease (VOD): The patient shows signs of presumed VOD, including RUQ pain, ascites, and possible reversal of portal flow. She has been started on treatment with defibrotide.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count remains low, and she requires ongoing monitoring and platelet transfusions to maintain a platelet count above 20,000/microliter.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 85.2 kg, 36-year-old male with a medical history of lymphoma, diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and pancytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He is sedated and responds to verbal stimuli. The patient's recent laboratory results show anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and thrombocytopenia. He is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and medications for pain control and diabetes management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and fluid overload. This may require ongoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) such as continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The need for RRT and the mode of delivery should be discussed with the renal service.

2. Hyperglycemia: The patient has well-controlled diabetes, but his blood glucose levels are currently elevated. Insulin therapy will be continued to maintain glycemic control. Conversion to long-acting insulin (Lantus) and the use of Rosiglitazone (RISS) should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of lymphoma, chronic pain, hypertension, diabetes, and renal failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, neutropenic fever with VRE infection, and pancytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) like continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels can increase the risk of infections, delay wound healing, and contribute to poor glycemic control.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: If related to VOD or other processes, unresolved hyperbilirubinemia can lead to complications such as hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy.
4. Neutropenic Fever with VRE Infection: The presence of neutropenic fever indicates an increased risk of bacterial infections. VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) infection can be challenging to treat and may lead to sepsis or bacteremia.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin levels increase the risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who underwent ablative chemotherapy and cord blood transplantation.
- She was admitted to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
- The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain, likely due to presumed VOD, and is being treated with defibrotide.
- She also has thrombocytopenia, which is persistently low, possibly due to chemotherapy. Platelet transfusions are being given as needed.
- The patient's blood pressure is within the desired range, and she is off labetalol.
- She had fevers and hypothermia, so an infected central venous line was removed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started.
- Her hyperglycemia is being managed with increased doses of Lantus insulin.
- The patient had a history of C. difficile colitis but is currently negative for the infection.
- She has mucositis, which is slowly improving, and intragluteal folds rash, which is not fungal in nature.
- The patient is experiencing nausea, bone pain, and contact dermatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) due to severe volume overload and need for CRRT.
2. Infection due to prolonged hospital stay, immunosuppression, and central venous catheters.
3. Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease ("

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.  She responded well to
   the lasix and put out 2.6 L and was only 1.3 L positive yesterday.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - Continue lasix 80 mg IV bid and following I/Os
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +20 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30, however her plt can be
   transfused for <20 given the difficulty maitaining her at 30.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to treatment with
   defibrotide.  Her T.bili continues to improve, today is 2.7.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 48 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3).   Will also start po vanc once she can take po
s per ID recs.
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the note mentions several medical conditions that the patient is experiencing.

The patient has been diagnosed with renal failure, lymphoma (cancer), hyperbilirubinemia, pancytopenia with neutropenic fever, VRE infection, hypertension, pain control, hyperglycemia, and other ICU-related concerns.

In terms of potential medical complications, there are several that can arise from these conditions:

1. Renal failure: This condition can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) such as dialysis.

2. Lymphoma: The patient's lymphoma diagnosis indicates a cancerous condition. Complications can include disease progression, spread of cancer to other organs, and treatment-related side effects.

3. Hyperbilirubinemia: This refers to elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood, which can be a sign of liver dysfunction or other underlying conditions. Complications may include liver damage, jaundice, and potential encephalopathy.

4. Pancytopenia and neutropenic fever: Pancytopenia refers to a reduction in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Neutropenic fever is a common complication in patients with low neutrophil counts. Complications can include severe infections, bleeding disorders, and anemia.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of lymphoma (cancer) who is currently admitted to the ICU for management of renal failure, pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, and VRE infection. The patient is also on a defibrotide protocol for VOD (veno-occlusive disease) related to previous cord stem cell transplantation (SCT).

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient received a 2.6L plasma transfusion overnight and has good urine output with Lasix diuresis.
- The patient is speaking in complete sentences and still experiencing abdominal pain. The patient wants to eat.
- Vital signs remain stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/79 to 120/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 2,914 mL total in, 2,340 mL IV fluids, 574 mL blood products, and 1,568 mL urine output.
- The patient's WBC count remains low at 0.2 K/uL. Hematocrit (Hct) levels are within normal range, and platelet count (Plt) is also low at 27.
- Renal function tests show an increase in creatinine (Cr) levels from 1.0 to 1.9.
- Other labs indicate elevated troponin-T levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and slightly decreased calcium (Ca++) levels.
- The patient's microorganisms are negative to date, with undetectable CMV viral load and pending EBV viral load.
- The patient's pain regimen will be continued, and glycemic control is well managed with regular insulin sliding scale.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prevention.
- The patient's code status remains full code, and disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is essential to prevent further renal dysfunction.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low WBC and platelet counts indicate pancytopenia, which increases the risk of infections and bleeding. Continuous monitoring of blood counts and prompt management of any signs of infection or bleeding are necessary.
3. VRE Infection: The patient has a Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection, which requires aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Close collaboration with the Infectious Disease service is crucial to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy and prevent the spread of VRE.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia, likely related to steroid therapy. Strict glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale is important to prevent complications associated with high blood sugar levels.
5. VOD: The patient's history of VOD following cord SCT increases the risk of hepatic complications. Monitoring of liver enzymes and close observation for signs"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient called out, however the BMT team was concerned about her
   mental status when they visited her.  She was awake and alert when
   evaluated after they left as she had been in the am.  The plan is to
   call her out in the am.
   - Her lantus was increased to 65 units [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**].
   - Per renal, continue diuresing with lasix and hold of CVVHD for now.
   Continue to hold IV acyclovir and ? of restarting tacroliums.
   - Per ID, continue antibiotics as they are, except change flagyl to po
   vanc when she is able to take po's.  Heme/onc wants a S&S consult
   before allowing her to take po's.
   - She got 1 unit of pRBC, 1 unit of FFP, and a few units of Plt over
   the last 24 h.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.  She responded well to
   the lasix and put out 2.6 L and was only 1.3 L positive yesterday.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - Continue lasix 80 mg IV bid and following I/Os
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +20 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30, however her plt can be
   transfused for <20 given the difficulty maitaining her at 30.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to treatment with
   defibrotide.  Her T.bili continues to improve, today is 2.7.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 48 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3).   Will also start po vanc once she can take po
s per ID recs.
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
