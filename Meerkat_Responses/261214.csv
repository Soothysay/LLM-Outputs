   Assessment and Plan
   55F TBM s/p Y-stent and hx of COPD p/w acute onset of barking cough,
   treated for anaphylaxis / stridor at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for
   further management.
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Unclear what the trigger of this event
   is, could be allergy, but no skin findings, could be secondary to
   pneumonia given possible consolidation seen on cxr, although this may
   have been soft tissue shadowing. Other possibilities include migration
   of Y stent, vocal cord dysfunction (given deepening voice), diastolic
   CHF exacerbation (given evidence of LVH on old ECHO). Dyspnea may also
   be due to bronchospasm [**1-15**] to mucomyst nebs.
   -Continue patients home CPAP settings at night..
   - Albuterol Ipratropium nebs ATC
   - Tessalon and guaifenesin for cough
   - Consider benadryl and steroids if evidence of stridor
   - Continue home fexofenadine
   - Hold mucomyst nebs for now
   - IP with bronch that did not show evidence of stent migration or
   occlusion.
   - ENT eval with no evidence of PVCM, only minimal posterior cricoid
   edema.
   - BIPAP at night and during day PRN for SOB (will try to control nausea
   first to make BIPAP more tolerable)
   .
   # UTI: Urine culture from ED growing > 100k E. Coli now with
   sensitivities complete (sensitive to ciprofloxacin). Patient has been
   afebrile and without flank pain so pyelonephritis is not suspected.
   Repeat U/A on [**2199-3-15**] showed 19 WBCs consistent with UTI.
   - continue patient on Ciprofloxacin 400mg PO BID with 3 day course
   planned.
   # N/V
   - Continue zofran prn
   - Add compazine PRN
   - if patient spikes fever or if abdominal distension worsens, would
   obtain CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast.
   # Htn: Continue home amlodipine, metoprolol and clonidine.
   .
   # GERD: While GERD may be contributing to symptoms, will increase
   Prilosec to 40mg PO BID.
   .
   # LE Edema: Continue home lasix.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchial malacia (TBM) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with an acute onset of barking cough. She was treated for anaphylaxis/stridor at the outside hospital and transferred to this hospital for further management.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/56 mmHg to 159/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is comfortable and not in respiratory distress. There is a face mask in place, and she has minimal mucosal moisture in the mouth, nose, and throat. Diffuse expiratory rhonchi bilaterally and expiratory wheezes over the anterior trachea are noted. The patient's cardiovascular system shows regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, or gallops. Her abdomen is described as obese, soft, and non-tender with minimal distension. There are no other notable findings on the external examination. Neurological assessment indicates that the patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

   55F TBM s/p Y-stent and hx of COPD p/w acute onset of barking cough,
   treated for anaphylaxis / stridor at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for
   further management.
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Unclear what the trigger of this event
   is, could be allergy, but no skin findings, could be secondary to
   pneumonia given possible consolidation seen on cxr, although this may
   have been soft tissue shadowing. Other possibilities include migration
   of Y stent, vocal cord dysfunction (given deepening voice), diastolic
   CHF exacerbation (given evidence of LVH on old ECHO). Dyspnea may also
   be due to bronchospasm [**1-15**] to mucomyst nebs.
   -Continue patients home CPAP settings at night..

   - IP with bronch that did not show evidence of stent migration or
   occlusion.
   - ENT eval with no evidence of PVCM, only minimal posterior cricoid
   edema.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchial malformation (TBM), status post Y-stent placement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with an acute onset of barking cough and was treated for anaphylaxis/stridor at the outpatient setting (OSH) before being transferred to the hospital for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 156/95 to 91/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is comfortable and not in respiratory distress. However, she has diffuse expiratory rhonchi bilaterally and expiratory wheezes over the anterior trachea.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, blood glucose level of 130 mg/dL, sodium level of 130 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, and a slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including dyspnea/respiratory distress, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypertension (htn), gastroesophageal reflux disease"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchial malacia (TBM) who underwent a Y-stent placement. She presented with an acute onset of barking cough and was initially treated for anaphylaxis/stridor at the outpatient setting (OSH) before being transferred to the hospital.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 91/56 mmHg to 159/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is comfortable and not in respiratory distress.

Physical examination findings reveal diffuse expiratory rhonchi bilaterally, expiratory wheezes over the anterior trachea, and no other significant abnormalities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal range.

The assessment and plan include several sections addressing different medical conditions:

   # Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Unclear what the trigger of this event
   is, could be URI, allergy (but no skin findings), pneumonia given
   possible consolidation seen on cxr (although this may have been soft
   tissue shadowing), migration of Y stent (unlikely given normal bronch),
   vocal cord dysfunction (given deepening voice, but ruled out by ENT
   laryngoscopy), diastolic CHF exacerbation (given evidence of LVH on old
   ECHO, edema), bronchospasm [**1-15**] to mucomyst nebs.
   - Albuterol Ipratropium nebs ATC

   edema; double dose PPI [**Hospital1 **] per ent recs
   - BIPAP at night and during day PRN for SOB (will try to control nausea
   first to make BIPAP more tolerable)
   - Await S&S study (likely Monday)
   .
   # UTI: Urine culture from ED growing > 100k E. Coli now with
   sensitivities complete (sensitive to ciprofloxacin). Patient has been
   afebrile and without flank pain so pyelonephritis is not suspected.
   Repeat U/A on [**2199-3-15**] showed 19 WBCs consistent with UTI.
   - continue patient on Ciprofloxacin 400mg PO BID with 3 day course
   planned, day 1 = [**3-15**]
   # N/V/loose stools. Resolved since stopped codeine (also had two loose
   BMs after feeling constipated all day, so may have been partly due to
   abdominal fullness); will continue to monitor.
   - Continue zofran, compazine prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with acute onset barking cough and was treated for anaphylaxis/stridor. She was transferred to the hospital for further management. The patient's current condition includes dyspnea/respiratory distress, UTI, N/V, loose stools, hypertension, GERD, leg edema, and fecal incontinence (FEN).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and respiratory distress could be triggered by various factors such as URI, allergy, pneumonia, migration of Y stent, vocal cord dysfunction, or diastolic CHF exacerbation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary. Administration of bronchodilators and corticosteroids may be required to alleviate bronchospasm.

2. UTI: The patient has a significant growth of E. Coli in her urine culture. It is important to ensure that the appropriate antibiotic therapy is continued based on the sensitivities of the organism. Regular monitoring of urine output and urinalysis should be done to assess the response to treatment.

3. Nausea/Vomiting and Loose Stools: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and loose stools may be due to codeine use or gastrointestinal issues. Zofran and compazine can be used for symptom control. Monitoring for any signs of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of bronchial stent placement, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and previous anaphylactic reaction. She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of barking cough and respiratory distress. The patient has been treated for anaphylaxis, stridor, and possible pneumonia. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient experienced nausea, vomiting, and loose stools but has improved since stopping codeine. She has been started on double-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and will continue with reflux management. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has some respiratory findings including diffuse expiratory rhonchi and wheezes. There are no significant abnormalities in her laboratory values except for elevated lactic acid levels. The patient's imaging shows linear atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with acute onset of barking cough and respiratory distress. The cause of this event is unclear, but possible triggers include URI, allergy, pneumonia, migration of Y stent, vocal cord dysfunction, or diastolic CHF exacerbation. The patient is currently on albuterol-ipratropium nebs ATC and BIPAP as needed for SOB.

2. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tuberculosis (TBM), Y-stent placement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with an acute onset of barking cough and was treated for anaphylaxis/stridor at the outdoor setting (OSH) before being transferred to the hospital for further management.

- The patient is currently experiencing dyspnea/respiratory distress, which remains unclear in terms of the trigger. Possible causes include bronchitis, allergy (although no skin findings are present), pneumonia (given possible consolidation seen on chest X-ray), migration of Y stent (unlikely due to normal bronchoscopic findings), vocal cord dysfunction (ruling out deepening voice), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation (given evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy on old echocardiogram and edema).

- The patient has been treated with albuterol ipratropium nebs ATC, Tessalon and guaifenesin for cough, consideration of benadryl and steroids if evidence of stridor, and continuation of home fexofenadine. Mucomyst nebs have been held for now.

- An ENT evaluation showed no evidence of posterior vocal cord movement (PVCM), only minimal posterior cricoid edema. A double dose of P"

   Assessment and Plan
   55F TBM s/p Y-stent and hx of COPD p/w acute onset of barking cough,
   treated for anaphylaxis / stridor at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for
   further management.
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Unclear what the trigger of this event
   is, could be bronchitis, allergy (but no skin findings), pneumonia
   given possible consolidation seen on cxr (although this may have been
   soft tissue shadowing), migration of Y stent (unlikely given normal
   bronch), vocal cord dysfunction (given deepening voice, but ruled out
   by ENT laryngoscopy), diastolic CHF exacerbation (given evidence of LVH
   on old ECHO, edema), bronchospasm [**1-15**] to mucomyst nebs.
   - Albuterol Ipratropium nebs ATC
   - Tessalon and guaifenesin for cough
   - Consider benadryl and steroids if evidence of stridor
   - Continue home fexofenadine
   - Hold mucomyst nebs for now
   - IP with bronch that did not show evidence of stent migration or
   occlusion; f/u IP recs; contact Dr [**Name (NI) 2249**] to find out if he visualized
   distal airways. Pt may need at least a trial of stent removal if she
   does not improve with conservative management after her acute
   bronchitis resolves.
   - ENT eval with no evidence of PVCM, only minimal posterior cricoid
   edema; double dose PPI [**Hospital1 **] per ent recs
   - BIPAP at night and during day PRN for SOB (will try to control nausea
   first to make BIPAP more tolerable)
   - Await S&S study (likely [**Hospital1 1088**])
   .
   # UTI: Urine culture from ED growing > 100k E. Coli sensitive to
   ciprofloxacin. Patient has been afebrile and without flank pain so
   pyelonephritis is not suspected.  U/A on [**2199-3-15**] showed 19 WBCs
   consistent with UTI.
   - 3 day course of ciprofloxacin 400mg PO BID complete yesterday (day 1
   = [**3-15**])
   # N/V/loose stools. Resolved since stopped codeine (also had two loose
   BMs after feeling constipated all day, so may have been partly due to
   abdominal fullness); will continue to monitor.
   - Continue zofran, compazine prn
   - if patient spikes fever or if abdominal distension worsens, would
   obtain CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast.
   - C diff negative X1; will resend if continues with more loose stool
   # Htn: Continue home amlodipine, metoprolol and clonidine.
   .
   # GERD: GERD may be contributing to symptoms; Prilosec to 40mg PO BID
   per ENT recs.
   .
   # LE Edema: Continue home lasix. (LOS balance -1.2 L)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, advance diet as tolerated;
   speech/swallow study today
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripheral X1 (not working well)
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: ICU for morning, possible call out to floor pending
   further improvement and no increased need for BIPAP
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of tuberculosis (TBM), Y-stent placement, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with an acute onset of barking cough and was initially treated for anaphylaxis/stridor at the emergency department before being transferred to the hospital.

The patient's current assessment and plan include several conditions:

1. Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: The cause of the patient's respiratory distress is unclear, with possible triggers including bronchitis, allergy, pneumonia, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, or vocal cord dysfunction. The patient has been treated with albuterol-ipratropium nebs ATC, Tessalon and guaifenesin for cough, and BIPAP at night and during the day as needed for shortness of breath (SOB). The patient may need a trial of stent removal if she does not improve with conservative management after her acute bronchitis resolves.

2. UTI: The patient had a urine culture growing more than 100,000 E. Coli, which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The patient has been afebrile and without flank pain, so pyelonephritis is not suspected. A 3-day course of ciprofloxacin 400mg PO BID was completed.

3. Nausea/Vomiting"
