","The patient is a 48-year-old female with HIV and a CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3 on HAART. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, for which she is receiving methotrexate maintenance with a steroid taper. The patient presents with fatigue, malaise, non-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, fever, and hypotension. She is admitted with one week of these symptoms.

The patient has reactive lymphadenopathy on the right side of the jaw, which could be consistent with a dental carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes. This is being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is also a possibility of re-crudescence of her Still's disease (increasing ferritin) and lymphoma with rising LDH, although the CT scan of the chest is not consistent with PCP.

The patient has been empirically treated for c. diff and is awaiting culture data. Oral surgery consult has been given due to concerns regarding an infected molar tooth and resultant sepsis. ID follow-up is planned for Bartonella, along with follow-up blood and urine cultures. Continuous antibiotics will be administered, as well as stress dose steroids (indication: previous use of steroids and HIV).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to a tooth infection. The patient presented with persistent hypotension, high diarrheal output, and fever. Initial laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.9 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 22.5%, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 25/41). Coagulation profile shows prolonged PT/PTT/INR, while kidney function is within normal limits. Blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fever, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggests ongoing infection leading to sepsis.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's high diarrheal output may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Tooth Infection: The patient's initial presentation suggests a tooth infection as the source of sepsis.
4. Organ Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes and coagulation abnormalities indicate possible organ dysfunction.
5. Bloodstream Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and pending blood cultures raise concern for a bloodstream infection.
6. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is being treated with metronidazole for suspected C. difficile infection.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen, indicating possible respiratory compromise.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She presented with malaise and fevers and was admitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. She is suspected to have sepsis with an unknown source, possibly a lung infection or abdominal process. The patient has significant submandibular/Right jaw lymphadenopathy, increasing hypoxia, and transaminitis. She also has a history of steroid and methotrexate use for over a year and is at risk for PCP pneumonia. There are other possibilities including LEMierre's disease, rheumatologic process, lymphoma, and thyroid abnormality. 

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis with an unknown source, possibly due to a lung infection or abdominal process.
2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which needs to be managed with appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing increasing hypoxia, indicating a potential respiratory failure. She may require mechanical ventilation.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), which can be secondary to methotrexate use or other causes such as liver abscess, thyroid disease, or celiac disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease. She presents with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, and is admitted to the ICU with concern for sepsis. She has submandibular and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and no known drug allergies. Her vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and an elevated heart rate. She has a high respiratory rate and her oxygen saturation is 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for diarrhea. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal prophylaxis. Further tests are pending, including blood cultures, sputum cultures, and viral load.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggests possible sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment of the source of infection are crucial.
2. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): Given the patient's HIV status and respiratory symptoms, PCP should be considered, and induced sputum for PCP is pending.
3. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection: The patient's immunos"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She presented with malaise and fevers and was admitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient is suspected to have sepsis with an unknown source, possibly a lung infection or abdominal process.

The patient's physical examination showed improving periorbital cellulitis and submandibular lead, no cardiac murmurs, no new rash, trace LE edema, and clear lungs. Her laboratory results indicated elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet count (Plt), and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is also positive for HIV and has been on antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

The assessment and plan include tooth extraction due to concern for tooth abscess, broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage, blood, urine, and sputum cultures, induction of sputum and glucan tests, and evaluation for hematologic disorders such as hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient will continue with HAART and be monitored for CD4 count and viral load. Lymph node biopsy is recommended for diagnosis of lymphoma, granulomatous disease, or infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Stills Disease who presented with malaise and fevers. She was admitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, and is being treated for sepsis with unknown source, likely a lung infection or abdominal process. She has submandibular/Right jaw LAD, increasing hypoxia, and possible tooth abscess. Other possibilities include rheumatologic process, Lemierr'e disease, AIDS-defining lymphoma, and thyroid abnormality. The patient has shown improvement in her condition, but still requires close monitoring and management of potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing management indicate a concern for sepsis. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Tooth abscess: The patient's jaw pain and submandibular mass raise the possibility of a tooth abscess. If left untreated, it can spread to surrounding tissues and lead to systemic complications.
3. Lemierr'e disease: Given the patient's jaw pain and periodontal involvement, Lemierr'e disease (a rare condition associated with periodontal disease) should be considered. It can cause systemic symptoms and complications.
4. AIDS-defining lymphoma: As an immunocompromised patient with HIV, the patient is at an increased risk for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV infection, recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3, on HAART therapy, and also has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease. She presents with one week of fatigue, malaise, cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, fever, and hypotension. The patient is admitted with unclear source of fevers and hypotension. The possible causes include an odontogenic infection in an immunocompromised host on MTX/steroids, reactive lymphadenopathy on the right side of the jaw, re-crudescence of Still's disease, lymphoma with rising LDH, and c. difficile infection. A CT scan of the chest is not consistent with PCP.

Assessment and Plan:
- Fever/hypotension: unclear source to fevers and hypotension, possibly due to odontogenic infection or reactivation of Still's disease or lymphoma. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered.
- Oral surgery consult for infected molar tooth and resultant sepsis.
- Empirical treatment for c. difficile infection.
- Induced sputum, GM, and 1,3 glucan follow-up.
- Follow-up blood and urine cultures.
- Continued empirical antibiotics.
- Stress dose steroids (indication: prev use of steroids and HIV).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, for which she is on methotrexate maintenance with a steroid taper. The patient presents with one week of fatigue, malaise, cough, non-productive, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, fever, and hypotension. The source of the fevers and hypotension is unclear, but an odontogenic infection in an immunocompromised host on MTX/Steroids is a leading cause. The patient also has reactive lymphadenopathy on the right side of the jaw, which could be consistent with a dental carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started empirically. There is also a possibility that this could represent re-crudescence of her Still's disease (increasing ferritin) or lymphoma with rising LDH. A CT scan of the chest is not consistent with PCP. Her diarrhea continues, and she is being empirically treated for C. diff. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased, which is potentially concerning for hemophagocytic syndrome in the setting of Still's disease. Rheumatology consultation is recommended to discuss hemophagocytic syndrome given the decreasing WBC (check triglycerides). Further investigations include GM and 1,3 glucan,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3 on HAART. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, for which she is on methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper. The patient presents with one week of fatigue, malaise, non-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever without a clear source. She has marked diarrhea despite negative C. diff test results. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.0°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 92/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals scleral edema, pre-orb edema, poor dentition, cervical adenopathy, crackles in the bilateral chest, and trace peripheral edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.9, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 298, anemia with an Hct of 22.5, elevated creatinine level of 0.6, and increased lactic acid level of 3.2 mmol/L. Blood clots have been negative, and C. diff has been ruled out three times.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3 on HAART. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, for which she is taking methotrexate maintenance with a steroid taper. The patient is admitted with symptoms including fatigue, malaise, non-productive cough, nausea, and left neck swelling. 

The patient's fever and hypotension could potentially be caused by an odontogenic infection in an immunocompromised host on MTX/Steroids, which is being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is also a possibility of re-crudescence of her Still's disease, lymphoma, or another underlying condition. A CT scan of the chest has ruled out PCP.

The patient's WBC count has decreased, which is concerning for hemophagocytic syndrome in the setting of Still's disease. Rheumatology should be consulted regarding this, and further investigations such as GM and 1,3 glucan should be done. Empirical treatment for c. diff will continue until three negative tests are obtained.

Oral surgery for tooth extraction is planned on [**11-19**]. ID following is needed, including a Bartonella assay. Blood and urine cultures should be followed up (all results are negative to date). Continuous empirical antibiotics will be administered, and the dose of prednisone will be decreased to 60 mg"

   48yoF from [**Country 3310**] HIV - undetectable vl, CD166, hypothyroid, Stills
   Disease mtx and prednisone taper presented with fever, admitted to
   Medicine floor, now transferred to MICU for hypotension and
   tachycardia.
      Pt was in [**Hospital **] clinic [**11-15**], reported fatigue, malaise for past month,
   with low grade fevers, mostly at night with occasional night sweats.
   Five days PTA, developed semi-productive cough, also a tender
   ""swelling"" under her chin. Was febrile and tachycardic in clinic, no O2
   requirement, admitted directly to CC7.
   Pt diagnosed with HIV [**2174**] after fiance +, no treatment. In [**2187**],
   started on study protocol (Gilead 934 study: Tefavirenz, emtriva,
   tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), treated since at [**Hospital1 19**], +compliance.
   MAC prophylaxis [**12/2187**] (azithromycin), then stopped [**12-13**]. Had
   admission [**Date range (3) 3313**] for hyperthyroidism with subsequent iodine
   ablation. Tested PPD+ [**11/2189**], underwent 9 months of INH treatment.
      She was admitted to the floor but triggered for hypotension and was
   transferred to the MICU for resuscitation. She was empirically covered
   with broad spectrum abx. She received stress dose steroids of HC 50 q6
   but then switched to prednisone 60 mg daily. The leading source to the
   fever has been dental abscess with reaction submental lymphnodes.
   Additional source to infection has been attributed to Still's disease
   given her markedly elevated ferritin. She never required vasopressors
   for hemodynamic support. She is scheduled for tooth extraction on
   Monday. She was intermittently tachypneic but had no chest pain,
   subjective shortness of breath or detectable hypoxia. Micro data has
   remained negative to date. Upon arrival to the floor she was febrile to
   103 and triggerred for RR 40 without subjective shortness of breath.
   She received a total of 3.5l IVF for borderline low SBPs (80s), then
   had a SBP to 65, which prompted a trigger.  ABG was drawn, which showed
   lactate >3, prompting MICU transfer.

   Assessment and Plan
   48yoF from [**Country 3310**] hx HIV, hypothyroid, Stills Disease, presents with
   malaise and fevers, admitted to MICU with fever, hypotension, and
   tachycardia, concern for sepsis with unknown source, likely lung
   infection vs. abdominal process.
   # fever/hypotension: no identifiable infectious source of fevers. Pt
   has improving but signficant submandibular/R-jaw LAD and diarrhea with
   transaminitis. Hx of steroid/mtx use >1yr, in addition to HIV status,
   therefore at risk for PCP pna, with clinical hx of cough and sob
   (reports compliance with 3x/wk bactrim). Prior imaging showed e/o of L
   upper lobe infiltrate vs fluid, which has since resolved. Concern for
   tooth abscess, ENT suggesting tooth extraction [**11-19**]. Lemierr'e disease
   also possible given jaw, periodontal pain, now with developing upper
   lobe infitrate. Other possiblities include rheumatologic process with
   hx of Stills' disease, thyroid abnormality. AIDS-defining lymphoma
   possibility with e/o of submandibular mass vs. LAD. Also considering
   hemophagocytic syndrome.
      Of note, intermittent hypotension of concern, pt meeting SIRS
   criteria, but maintaining sbp with IVF boluses.  No PE findings of
   cardiogenic shock or obstructive shock, but has elevated JVP with
   markedly cold extremities, which is new for pt.  Given overall picture,
   need to re-image abd and chest-CTA to r/o PE.
   - maintain MAPs>55, trend lactate, IVF boluses
   - CT-PE protocol r/o PE
   - EKG now
   - CT head without contrast r/o acute pathologic process
   - TTE assess for endocarditis, ventricular dysfunction
   - add-on LFTs
   - plan for tooth extraction [**11-19**], NPO, coags on [**11-19**] am
   - blood, urine, cdiff, sputum cxs f/u
   - cryptococcus/cmv/hiv vl pending, induced sputum, glucan pending
   - vanco/unasyn for broad coverage, changed from zosyn today11/8 per ID
 plan for 10d, to complete [**11-24**]
   - bactrim prophylaxis dose
   - prednisone 60mg qd as per rheum recs
   - ultimately, needs lymph node biopsy for diagnosis: lymphoma,
   granulomatous disease, infection
   - fluconazole for thrush
   # heme/anemia/coagulopathy: baseline low hct, normocytic anemia, now
   with 3 pt drop in hct, unknown source, no e/o of bleeding.  Consider
   other causes, developing TTP, HUS.  Baseline coagulopathy vs. less
   likely, DIC, as labs do not support latter with elevated fibrinogen.
   Clinical picture may be changing, so need to reassess.
   - t/s
   - follow hct, coags
   # HIV: as above, continue HAART
   - cont HAART
   - f/u CD4 count, viral load
   # transaminitis: mild elevation, with AP elevation, nl TB.  Can be
   secondary to mtx, but ast/alt predominance may suggest either
   alternative source (muscle necrosis - not likely, thyroid disease - hx
   of grave's with RAI, adrenal insufficiency - no eos, celiac dz).
   Concern would be for liver abscess, but without marked leukocytosis,
   less likely.  Has been exposed to hepatitis B according to serologies.
   - recheck LFTs
   # Still's Diease: Pt with continued joint pain and contituitional
   symptoms. Pt has been treated with prednisone 10mg and methotrexate for
   therapy. If pt symptoms worsens t/c C-spine MRI to evaluate for other
   etiology (ie malignancy). ?Incidence of Still's Disease in HIV

","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease. She presented with malaise, fevers, and was admitted to the ICU due to fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest sepsis. The source of infection is still unknown, with possibilities ranging from a lung infection to an abdominal process.

2. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): Given the patient's HIV status and symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, there is a concern for PCP. Although she is reported to be compliant with prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), further evaluation is needed.

3. Tooth abscess: The patient has a submandibular mass that is tender and may indicate a tooth abscess. An upcoming tooth extraction has been planned.

4. Lemierre's disease: This is a rare condition characterized by thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and subsequent septic emboli. It may be a possibility due to the patient's jaw pain and periodontal pain.

5. Rheumatologic process: Considering the patient's history of Still's disease, there is a concern for a rheumatologic process causing joint pain and constitutional"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old HIV
infected female with recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3
   ([**2192-8-10**]) on HAART, h/o thyroid disease; h/o adult Stills disease on
   methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper (on Bactrim prophylaxis);
   is admitted with one week h/o fatigue, malaise; cough non productive;
   NV; LT neck swelling.  She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile
   without clear source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite
   negative c.dif.
    >Fever/Hypotension: unclear source to fevers and hypotension although
   oodotogenic infection in a immunocompromised host on MTX/ Steroids
   looms at the leading cause. she has some reactive lymphadenopathy on
   the right side of the jaw. Could be consistent with dental
   carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes which we are
   covering with broad spectrum Abx.   There is also a possibility that
   this could represent re-crudescence of her Still's disease (increasing
   ferritin), notably she got worse when she was changed to prednisone PO.
   Lymphoma with rising LDH also a concern. CT scan of the chest is not at
   all consistent with PCP (neg induced sputum). Her diarrhea conts and we
   are empirically treating c. dif (awaiting 3 neg , she has a hx of c.
   dif) her CT scan is consistent with ileitis and in this
   immunocomprimised (despite normal CD4 count) dx such as
   cryptosporidium, CMV etc need to be considered. Will obtain GI clx.  On
   transfer she was changed from Pip-tazo to flagyl and Unasyn. We will
   restart the Pip-tazo and empirically cover c. dif. With flagyl.
   Galactomannan and 1,3 glucan from [**11-15**] are negative at present.
   - GI consult  today to evaluate ileitis. [**Month (only) 51**] need colonoscopy.
   - Will cont to discuss with Rheumatology (her wbc has increased again)
   as to whether this could actually be Still
   - F/u GM and 1,3 glucan
   - Oral surgery for tooth extraction on [**11-19**] (will need to defer
   pending hemodynamic stability)
   - ID following (appreciate input)
   - Follow up blood and urine clx (all results neg to date). Check stool
   clx and O+P, cryptosporidium.
   - Cont to stress dose steroids.
   - MAP goal > 60 mmHg (fluid bolus with PR as needed, baseline BP is
   90-100/60mmHg)
   - Ehrlicia and thin-thick smear.
   - TTE: persistently febrile, no clear embolic manifestations
   > Hypoxemia: relatively clear CXR and resp alkaosis on ABG. Neg PE
   protocol CT scan [**11-18**])
   - her coags (both apt and INR are up): ? antii-phospholipid Ab
   syndrome.
   > Coagulopathy: unclear reason to explain aPTT and INR increases. Will
   check aPL work up.
   - Vit K x 3 days
   >Metabolic acidosos: elevated lactate but also concern for loss of HCO3
   in the stool from diarrhea. Will check urine lytes (for urine anion
   gap) and profound hypokalemia.
   - IV hydration
   > HIV: cont HAART, now with CD4 of 451.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 48-year-old female with HIV, a CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3, on HAART, with a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease.
- She presents with symptoms including fatigue, malaise, nonproductive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, and recurrent hypotension and fever without a clear source.
- She has been diagnosed with marked diarrhea despite negative C. diff, and her CT scan shows ileitis.
- Other possible diagnoses include odontogenic infection, reactivation of Still's disease, lymphoma, and infections such as cryptosporidium or CMV.
- The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a GI consult has been scheduled to evaluate the ileitis.
- She also requires further evaluation for possible Still's disease, as her WBC count has increased again.
- Oral surgery for tooth extraction is pending hemodynamic stability.
- The patient is currently on stress dose steroids and is being closely monitored for hypotension, fever, hypoxemia, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis.
- Her HIV treatment has been adjusted, and her CD4 count has improved to 451.
- The patient is receiving appropriate prophylactic measures, including DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP prophylaxis.

   ([**2192-8-10**]) on HAART, h/o thyroid disease; h/o adult Stills disease on
   methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper (on Bactrim prophylaxis);
   is admitted with one week h/o fatigue, malaise; cough non productive;
   NV; LT neck swelling.  She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile
   without clear source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite
   negative c.dif.
    >Fever/Hypotension: unclear source to fevers and hypotension although
   oodotogenic infection in a immunocompromised host on MTX/ Steroids
   looms at the leading cause. she has some reactive lymphadenopathy on
   the right side of the jaw. Could be consistent with dental
   carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes which we are
   covering with broad spectrum Abx.   There is also a possibility that
   this could represent re-crudescence of her Still's disease (increasing
   ferritin) Lymphoma with rising LDH also a concern. CT scan of the chest
   is not at all consistent with PCP (neg induced sputum). Her diarrhea
   conts and we are empirically treating c. dif (awaiting 3 neg , she has
   a hx of c. dif).  On transfer she was changed from Pip-tazo to flagyl
   and Unasyn. We will restart the Pip-tazo and empirically cover c. dif.
   With flagyl.
   - Will need to re-image the abdomen to search for source of abdominal
   infection (given notable
   - Will cont to discuss with Rheumatology (her wbc has increased again)
   - F/u GM and 1,3 glucan
   - Awaitin c. dif cx neg x 3, empiric treatment until then.
   - Oral surgery for tooth extraction on [**11-19**] (will need to defer
   pending hemodynamic stability)
   - ID following (appreciate input):
   - Follow up blood and urine clx (all results neg to date). Check stool
   clx and O+P, cryptosporidium.
   - Re-check LFTs and lactate.
   - Increase to stress dose steroids
   - Re-image head CT (notably toxo and crypto neg), Chest CT (PE
   protocol) and Abd/pel CT
   - MAP goal > 60 mmHg (fluid bolus with PR as needed, baseline BP is
   90-100/60mmHg)
   - Ehrlicia and thin-thick smear.
   - TTE: persistently febrile, no clear embolic manifestations
   > Hypoxemia: relatively clear CXR and resp alkaosis on ABG. We are
   concerned  for PE and will obtain PE protocol CT scan
   - her coags (both apt and INR are up): ? antii-phospholipid Ab
   syndrome.
   > Coagulopathy: unclear reason to explain aPTT and INR increases. Will
   check aPL work up.
   - peripheral smear
   - Vit K x 3 days
   Metabolic acidosos: elevated lactate but also concern for loss of HCO3
   in the stool from diarrhea. Will check urine lytes (for urine anion
   gap) and profound hypokalemia.
   - IV hydration
   > HIV: cont HAART, now with CD4 of 451.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3 on HAART. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, for which she is on methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper. The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, malaise, nonproductive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever without a clear source. She also has marked diarrhea despite negative C. difficile test. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Fever/Hypotension: The patient has fevers and hypotension without a clear source. Oodotogenic infection in an immunocompromised host on MTX/Steroids is a leading cause. There is also a possibility of re-crudescence of her Still's disease or lymphoma with rising LDH. A CT scan of the chest is not consistent with PCP.

2. Lymphadenopathy: The patient has reactive lymphadenopathy on the right side of the jaw, which could be consistent with dental carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes.

3. Diarrhea: The patient continues to have marked diarrhea, and empirical treatment for C. difficile is being given. The CT scan is consistent with ileitis, and in an immunocompromised patient, conditions such as cryptosporidium or CMV need to be considered."

   48yoF from [**Country 3310**] hx HIV, hypothyroid, Stills Disease, presents with
   malaise and fevers, admitted to MICU with fever, hypotension, and
   tachycardia, concern for sepsis with unknown source, likely lung
   infection vs. abdominal process.
   # fever/hypotension: no identifiable infectious source of fevers. Pt
   has improving but signficant submandibular/R-jaw LAD and diarrhea with
   transaminitis. Hx of steroid/mtx use >1yr, in addition to HIV status,
   therefore at risk for PCP pna, with clinical hx of cough and sob
   (reports compliance with 3x/wk bactrim). Prior imaging showed e/o of L
   upper lobe infiltrate vs fluid, which has since resolved. Concern for
   tooth abscess, ENT suggesting tooth extraction [**11-19**]. Lemierr'e disease
   also possible given jaw, periodontal pain, now with developing upper
   lobe infitrate. Other possiblities include rheumatologic process with
   hx of Stills' disease, thyroid abnormality. AIDS-defining lymphoma
   possibility with e/o of submandibular mass vs. LAD. Also considering
   hemophagocytic syndrome.
      Of note, intermittent hypotension of concern, pt meeting SIRS
   criteria, but maintaining sbp with IVF boluses.  No PE findings of
   cardiogenic shock or obstructive shock, but has elevated JVP with
   markedly cold extremities, which is new for pt.  Given overall picture,
   need to re-image abd and chest-CTA to r/o PE.
   - maintain MAPs>55, trend lactate, IVF boluses
   - CT-PE protocol r/o PE

   - ultimately, needs lymph node biopsy for diagnosis: lymphoma,
   granulomatous disease, infection
   - fluconazole for thrush
   # heme/anemia/coagulopathy: baseline low hct, normocytic anemia, now
   with 3 pt drop in hct, unknown source, no e/o of bleeding.  Consider
   other causes, developing TTP, HUS.  Baseline coagulopathy vs. less
   likely, DIC, as labs do not support latter with elevated fibrinogen.
   Clinical picture may be changing, so need to reassess.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease. She presents with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, which are concerning for sepsis with an unknown source. She has been admitted to the MICU and is currently experiencing diarrhea, transaminitis, and a submandibular/right jaw abscess. There is also a concern for a tooth abscess, which is planned for extraction today. Imaging shows no evidence of pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or lymphadenopathy. However, there is evidence of new ascites, ileocolitis, and a small bilateral pleural effusion. The patient's blood work indicates anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of coagulopathy. She has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and is currently being treated with levothyroxine. The patient is also being treated for Still's disease with prednisone and methotrexate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest a possible septic state. Immediate attention should be given to identifying the source of infection and providing appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Tooth Abscess: The patient has a planned tooth extraction today, which may be complicated by the presence of a tooth abscess. Proper antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered prior to the procedure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension. The patient has been experiencing high output of diarrhea, hypokalemia, and fever. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg and heart rate of 81 bpm. The patient has multiple lumen placed, CVL placed, and is receiving various medications including piperacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is NPO for a planned tooth extraction. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and abnormal liver function tests may suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's high output of diarrhea may indicate an intestinal infection or inflammatory condition, leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg indicates hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, dehydration, or other underlying causes.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels may contribute to"

   Assessment and Plan
   48yoF from [**Country 3310**] hx HIV, hypothyroid, Stills Disease, presents with
   malaise and fevers, now readmitted to MICU with fever, hypotension, and
   tachycardia, concern for sepsis with unknown source.
   # hypotension: now resolved.  Concern for sepsis but more likely seems
   to have possible adrenal insufficiency (changed to PO  steroids,
   profuse diarrhea and likely poorly absorbing).  Now SBP > 80 (her
   baseline) since admission.
   -          Bolus prn to maintain CVP 8-12.
   -          Infectious workup as below.
   -          Trend lactates.
   # fever:  no idenitiable source thus far.  Has had submandibular/jaw
   LAD, diarrhea, transaminitis, tooth abscess.  Other possibilities
   include noninfectious causes (Stills in particular).  Pan-Ct yesterday.
   -          tooth extraction planned for today
   -          f/u ID recs.
   -          Consult GI re: ileocolitis.
   -          f/u existing culture data
   -          consider LN biopsy as previously discussed.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease.
- She presented with malaise and fevers and was readmitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia.
- The initial concern was sepsis with an unknown source, but it is now more likely that the patient has possible adrenal insufficiency.
- The patient has profuse diarrhea and is likely poorly absorbing, which could be causing her hypokalemia.
- She has been started on PO steroids, and her blood pressure has improved, staying above 80 mmHg.
- The patient has a fever without an identifiable source. She has had submandibular/jaw LAD, diarrhea, transaminitis, and tooth abscess. Other possibilities include noninfectious causes, particularly Still's disease.
- A CT scan was performed yesterday, and a tooth extraction is planned for today.
- The patient's ileocolitis needs further evaluation by GI.
- She has ongoing infectious workup and culture data to follow.
- Consideration should be given to a lymph node biopsy as previously discussed.
- The patient has a baseline low hct and normocytic anemia, and her coagulopathy is not improving with vitamin K. The etiology is unclear.
- The patient's HIV treatment should continue with HAART.

   Assessment and Plan
   48yoF from [**Country 3310**] hx HIV, hypothyroid, Stills Disease, presents with
   malaise and fevers, admitted to MICU with fever, hypotension, and
   tachycardia, concern for sepsis with unknown source, likely lung
   infection vs. abdominal process.
   # fever/hypotension: no identifiable infectious source of fevers. Pt
   has improving but signficant submandibular/R-jaw LAD and diarrhea with
   transaminitis. Hx of steroid/mtx use >1yr, in addition to HIV status,
   therefore at risk for PCP pna, with clinical hx of cough and sob
   (reports compliance with 3x/wk bactrim). Prior imaging showed e/o of L
   upper lobe infiltrate vs fluid, which has since resolved. Concern for
   tooth abscess, ENT suggesting tooth extraction [**11-19**]. Lemierr'e disease
   also possible given jaw, periodontal pain, now with developing upper
   lobe infitrate. Other possiblities include rheumatologic process with
   hx of Stills' disease, thyroid abnormality. AIDS-defining lymphoma
   possibility with e/o of submandibular mass vs. LAD. Also considering
   hemophagocytic syndrome.
      Of note, intermittent hypotension of concern, pt meeting SIRS
   criteria, but maintaining sbp with IVF boluses.  No PE findings of
   cardiogenic shock or obstructive shock, but has elevated JVP with
   markedly cold extremities, which is new for pt.  Given overall picture,
   need to re-image abd and chest-CTA to r/o PE.
   - maintain MAPs>55, trend lactate, IVF boluses
   - CT-PE protocol r/o PE
   - EKG now
   - CT head without contrast r/o acute pathologic process
   - TTE assess for endocarditis, ventricular dysfunction

   - bactrim prophylaxis dose
   - prednisone 60mg qd as per rheum recs
   - ultimately, needs lymph node biopsy for diagnosis: lymphoma,
   granulomatous disease, infection
   - fluconazole for thrush
   # heme/anemia/coagulopathy: baseline low hct, normocytic anemia, now
   with 3 pt drop in hct, unknown source, no e/o of bleeding.  Consider
   other causes, developing TTP, HUS.  Baseline coagulopathy vs. less
   likely, DIC, as labs do not support latter with elevated fibrinogen.
   Clinical picture may be changing, so need to reassess.
   - t/s
   - follow hct, coags
   # HIV: as above, continue HAART
   - cont HAART
   - f/u CD4 count, viral load
   # transaminitis: mild elevation, with AP elevation, nl TB.  Can be
   secondary to mtx, but ast/alt predominance may suggest either
   alternative source (muscle necrosis - not likely, thyroid disease - hx
   of grave's with RAI, adrenal insufficiency - no eos, celiac dz).
   Concern would be for liver abscess, but without marked leukocytosis,
   less likely.  Has been exposed to hepatitis B according to serologies.
   - recheck LFTs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease. She presents with malaise, fevers, hypotension, tachycardia, and concern for sepsis with an unknown source. The patient has been admitted to the MICU and has been receiving various treatments including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.

The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities, including HIV, which puts her at risk for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). She also has a history of steroid and methotrexate use, which can cause immunosuppression. The patient's symptoms include fever, hypotension, diarrhea, and a submandibular/retro-orbital mass.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and renal dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal ileocolitis, fluid around the gallbladder, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggests sepsis, possibly due to a lung infection or abdominal process.
2. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): Given the patient's HIV status and immunosuppression, there"

   Assessment and Plan
   48yoF from [**Country 3310**] hx HIV, hypothyroid, Stills Disease, presents with
   malaise and fevers, now readmitted to MICU with fever, hypotension, and
   tachycardia, concern for sepsis with unknown source.
   # fever/hypotension: no identifiable infectious source of fevers. Pt
   has improving but signficant submandibular/R-jaw LAD and diarrhea with
   transaminitis. Hx of steroid/mtx use >1yr, in addition to HIV status,
   therefore at risk for PCP pna, with clinical hx of cough and sob
   (reports compliance with 3x/wk bactrim). Prior imaging showed e/o of L
   upper lobe infiltrate vs fluid, which has since resolved. Concern for
   tooth abscess, ENT suggesting tooth extraction [**11-19**]. Lemierr'e disease
   also possible given jaw, periodontal pain, now with developing upper
   lobe infitrate. Other possiblities include rheumatologic process with
   hx of Stills' disease, thyroid abnormality. AIDS-defining lymphoma
   possibility with e/o of submandibular mass vs. LAD. Also considering
   hemophagocytic syndrome.
      Of note, intermittent hypotension of concern, pt meeting SIRS
   criteria, but maintaining sbp with IVF boluses.  No PE findings of
   cardiogenic shock or obstructive shock, but has elevated JVP with
   markedly cold extremities, which is new for pt.  Given overall picture,
   need to re-image abd and chest-CTA to r/o PE.
   - maintain MAPs>55, trend lactate, IVF boluses
   - CT-PE protocol r/o PE
   - EKG now
   - CT head without contrast r/o acute pathologic process
   - TTE assess for endocarditis, ventricular dysfunction
   - add-on LFTs
   - plan for tooth extraction [**11-19**], NPO, coags on [**11-19**] am

   - cryptococcus/cmv/hiv vl pending, induced sputum, glucan pending
   - vanco/unasyn for broad coverage, changed from zosyn today11/8 per ID
 plan for 10d, to complete [**11-24**]
   - bactrim prophylaxis dose
   - prednisone 60mg qd as per rheum recs
   - ultimately, needs lymph node biopsy for diagnosis: lymphoma,
   granulomatous disease, infection
   - fluconazole for thrush
   # heme/anemia/coagulopathy: baseline low hct, normocytic anemia, now
   with 3 pt drop in hct, unknown source, no e/o of bleeding.  Consider
   other causes, developing TTP, HUS.  Baseline coagulopathy vs. less
   likely, DIC, as labs do not support latter with elevated fibrinogen.
   Clinical picture may be changing, so need to reassess.
   - t/s
   - follow hct, coags
   # HIV: as above, continue HAART
   - cont HAART
   - f/u CD4 count, viral load
   # transaminitis: mild elevation, with AP elevation, nl TB.  Can be
   secondary to mtx, but ast/alt predominance may suggest either
   alternative source (muscle necrosis - not likely, thyroid disease - hx
   of grave's with RAI, adrenal insufficiency - no eos, celiac dz).
   Concern would be for liver abscess, but without marked leukocytosis,
   less likely.  Has been exposed to hepatitis B according to serologies.
   - recheck LFTs
   # Still's Diease: Pt with continued joint pain and contituitional
   symptoms. Pt has been treated with prednisone 10mg and methotrexate for

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease. She presents with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, concern for sepsis with an unknown source. The patient has improving but significant submandibular/Right jaw LAD and diarrhea with transaminitis. She also has a history of steroid/mtx use over one year and is at risk for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to her HIV status, although she reports compliance with 3x/week Bactrim. Prior imaging showed evidence of left upper lobe infiltrate vs fluid, which has since resolved. There is a concern for a tooth abscess, and the ENT suggests tooth extraction. The patient may also have Lemierre's disease given the jaw pain, periodontal pain, and developing upper lobe infiltrate. Other possibilities include rheumatologic process with a history of Still's disease, thyroid abnormality, AIDS-defining lymphoma possibility with evidence of submandibular mass vs Left atrial dilatation (LAD), and hemophagocytic syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old HIV
infected female with recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3
   ([**2192-8-10**]) on HAART, h/o thyroid disease; h/o adult Stills disease on
   methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper (on Bactrim prophylaxis);
   is admitted with one week h/o fatigue, malaise; cough non productive;
   NV; LT neck swelling.  She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile
   without clear source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite
   negative c.dif.
    >Fever/Hypotension: unclear source to fevers and hypotension although
   oodotogenic infection in a immunocompromised host on MTX/ Steroids
   looms at the leading cause. she has some reactive lymphadenopathy on
   the right side of the jaw. Could be consistent with dental
   carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes which we are
   covering with broad spectrum Abx.   There is also a possibility that
   this could represent re-crudescence of her Still's disease (increasing
   ferritin), notably she got worse when she was changed to prednisone PO.
   Lymphoma with rising LDH also a concern. CT scan of the chest is not at
   all consistent with PCP (neg induced sputum). Her diarrhea conts and we
   are empirically treating c. dif (awaiting 3 neg , she has a hx of c.
   dif) her CT scan is consistent with ileitis and in this
   immunocomprimised (despite normal CD4 count) dx such as
   cryptosporidium, CMV etc need to be considered. Will obtain GI clx.  On
   transfer she was changed from Pip-tazo to flagyl and Unasyn. We will
   restart the Pip-tazo and empirically cover c. dif. With flagyl.
   Galactomannan and 1,3 glucan from [**11-15**] are negative at present.
   - GI consult  today to evaluate ileitis. [**Month (only) 51**] need colonoscopy.
   - Will cont to discuss with Rheumatology (her wbc has increased again)
   as to whether this could actually be Still
   - F/u GM and 1,3 glucan
   - Oral surgery for tooth extraction on [**11-19**] (will need to defer
   pending hemodynamic stability)
   - ID following (appreciate input)
   - Follow up blood and urine clx (all results neg to date). Check stool
   clx and O+P, cryptosporidium.
   - Cont to stress dose steroids.
   - MAP goal > 60 mmHg (fluid bolus with PR as needed, baseline BP is
   90-100/60mmHg)
   - Ehrlicia and thin-thick smear.
   - TTE: persistently febrile, no clear embolic manifestations
   > Hypoxemia: relatively clear CXR and resp alkaosis on ABG. Neg PE
   protocol CT scan [**11-18**])
   - her coags (both apt and INR are up): ? antii-phospholipid Ab
   syndrome.
   > Coagulopathy: unclear reason to explain aPTT and INR increases. Will
   check aPL work up.
   - Vit K x 3 days
   >Metabolic acidosos: elevated lactate but also concern for loss of HCO3
   in the stool from diarrhea. Will check urine lytes (for urine anion
   gap) and profound hypokalemia.
   - IV hydration
   > HIV: cont HAART, now with CD4 of 451.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3 on HAART. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, for which she is taking methotrexate maintenance with a steroid taper. The patient presents with one week of fatigue, malaise, nonproductive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever without a clear source. She also has marked diarrhea despite negative c. diff. The patient is currently admitted with these symptoms.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever/Hypotension: The unclear source of fevers and hypotension may be due to an odontogenic infection in an immunocompromised host on MTX/Steroids. This is leading cause is being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is also a possibility of re-crudescence of her Still's disease or lymphoma with rising LDH. A CT scan of the chest is not consistent with PCP (neg induced sputum). Her diarrhea continues, and empirical treatment for c. diff is being administered while awaiting three negative results. Her CT scan is consistent with ileitis, and in this immunocompromised patient, diagnoses such as cryptosporidium or CMV need to be considered. A GI consult will be obtained today to evaluate ileitis, and a colonoscopy is needed within 51 days.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old HIV
infected female with recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3
   ([**2192-8-10**]) on HAART, h/o thyroid disease; h/o adult Stills disease on
   methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper (on Bactrim prophylaxis);
   is admitted with one week h/o fatigue, malaise; cough non productive;
   NV; LT neck swelling.  She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile
   without clear source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite
   negative c.dif.
   >Fever/Hypotension: unclear source to fevers and hypotension although
   oodotogenic infection in a immunocompromised host on MTX/ Steroids
   looms at the leading cause. she has some reactive lymphadenopathy on
   the right side of the jaw. Could be consistent with dental
   carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes which we are
   covering with broad spectrum Abx. And we have now extracted the tooth.
   There is also a possibility that this could represent re-crudescence of
   her Still's disease (increasing ferritin), notably she got worse when
   she was changed to prednisone PO. Lymphoma with rising LDH also a
   concern. CT scan of the chest is not at all consistent with PCP (neg
   induced sputum). Her diarrhea conts and we are empirically treating c.
   dif (despite 3 neg , she has a hx of c. dif) her CT scan is consistent
   with ileitis and in this immunocomprimised (despite normal CD4 count)
   dx such as cryptosporidium (although neg on DFA), CMV etc need to be
   considered. Will obtain GI clx.  We will need to at least consider
   colonoscopyt. The concern now is that her WBC is improving and she has
   a marked bandemia today, her abdominal exam is not necessarily
   re-assuring given her high dose steroids.
   - GI consult to evaluate ileitis. [**Month (only) 51**] need colonoscopy. Also may need
   repeat imaging (CT abd)
   - check lactate and LFTs
   - Will cont to discuss with Rheumatology (her wbc has increased again)
   as to whether this could actually be Still
s worsening (we will repeat
   the diltutional assay of her ferritin as it is >[**2184**])
   - ID following (appreciate input)
   - Follow up blood and urine clx (all results neg to date). Stool clx
   have been neg to date.
   - Cont to stress dose steroids.
   - MAP goal > 60 mmHg (fluid bolus with PR as needed, baseline BP is
   90-100/60mmHg)
   - Ehrlicia and thin-thick smear.
   -  F/u urine histo Ag.
   > Hypoxemia: relatively clear CXR and resp alkaosis on ABG. Neg PE
   protocol CT scan [**11-18**])
   - her coags (both apt and INR are up): ? antii-phospholipid Ab syndrome
   awaiting input.
   > Coagulopathy: unclear reason to explain aPTT and INR increases. Will
   check aPL work up.
   - Vit K x 3 days
   >Metabolic acidosos: elevated lactate but also concern for loss of HCO3
   in the stool from diarrhea. Will check urine lytes (for urine anion
   gap) and profound hypokalemia.
   - IV hydration
   > HIV: cont HAART, now with CD4 of 451.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV infection, currently on HAART therapy, and a recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3. She has been admitted with symptoms including fatigue, malaise, cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever. The patient has been diagnosed with various conditions, including dental abscess, Still's disease, possible lymphoma, ileitis, and cryptosporidiosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to HIV infection and ongoing immunosuppressive therapy. This increases the risk of infections, including dental abscess, gastrointestinal infections (such as cryptosporidiosis and CMV), and respiratory infections.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced recurrent hypotension, which could be due to sepsis or other causes such as adrenal insufficiency or medication side effects.
3. Fever: The patient has had persistent fever, indicating possible ongoing infection or inflammation.
4. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has diarrhea and ileitis, which may be caused by infections (such as cryptosporidium or CMV) or inflammatory bowel disease.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation tests, including prolonged aPTT and INR, which may indicate a coagulation disorder or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with HIV, on HAART therapy, and has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease. She was admitted with symptoms of fatigue, malaise, non-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever without a clear source. She also has marked diarrhea despite negative c. diff results. The patient's CD4 count is 166 cells/mm3.

Potential medical complications:
1. Fever/Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypotension and fevers without a clear source. One possible cause could be an odontogenic infection in an immunocompromised host on methotrexate/steroids.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels and concerns about loss of bicarbonate in the stool from diarrhea.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and international normalized ratio (INR) are increased. This could be due to antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient has relative hypoxemia despite normal chest X-ray and respiratory alkalosis on arterial blood gas (ABG).
5. Cryptosporidium infection: Although the patient's DFA stool is negative, cryptosporidium infection should still be considered due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   48yoF from [**Country 3310**] hx HIV, hypothyroid, Stills Disease, presents with
   malaise and fevers, now readmitted to MICU with fever, hypotension, and
   tachycardia, concern for sepsis with unknown source.
   # hypotension: now resolved.  Concern for sepsis but more likely seems
   to have possible adrenal insufficiency (changed to PO  steroids,
   profuse diarrhea and likely poorly absorbing).  Now SBP > 80 (her
   baseline) since admission.
   -          Bolus prn to maintain CVP 8-12.
   -          Infectious workup as below.
   -          Trend lactates.
   # fever:  no idenitiable source thus far.  Has had submandibular/jaw
   LAD, diarrhea, transaminitis, tooth abscess.  Other possibilities

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She presents with malaise and fevers, and is now readmitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The concern is for sepsis with an unknown source. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and there is a concern for possible adrenal insufficiency. She is currently on PO steroids, which have resulted in profuse diarrhea and poor absorption. Her SBP is >80 (her baseline) since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia raises concerns for sepsis. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy promptly to prevent further complications.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and malabsorption, along with the need for increased steroid doses, suggest a possible adrenal insufficiency. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, and shock if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which may contribute to her overall weakness and fatigue. It is important to monitor her thyroid function and adjust her medication dosage accordingly.
4. Still's Disease: The patient has ongoing joint pain and constitutional symptoms consistent with Still's Disease."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She presented with malaise and fevers and was readmitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. There is concern for sepsis with an unknown source. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has had one episode of hypotension with a blood pressure of 65. She is being treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, and antifungals for broad-spectrum coverage. Further workup is ongoing to identify the source of infection, including a CT scan showing possible colitis. The patient also has a submandibular infection, diarrhea, transaminitis, and a tooth abscess, which have been addressed. Her anemia and coagulopathy are being monitored, and she is receiving treatment for her underlying conditions, including HIV, Still's Disease, and hypothyroidism. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is expected to undergo a GI scope for further evaluation. Potential medical complications include sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and respiratory failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease. She presents with malaise and fevers, and is now readmitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The concern is for sepsis with an unknown source. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a high lactate level indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. There are no new chest x-rays, and the patient is on IV steroids for presumed relative adrenal insufficiency. The patient has a submandibular/jaw lesion, diarrhea, transaminitis, and a tooth abscess that was removed on 11/19. There is a concern for lymphoma, Still's disease exacerbation, or colitis based on CT findings from 11/18. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl for pan coverage, and is also being prepared for a colonoscopy on 11/21. There are concerns about tuberculosis reactivation, and the patient is awaiting c-scope and biopsies. The patient's coagulopathy is still elevated but stable. She has a baseline low hematocrit and normocytic anemia. The patient's HIV treatment should continue, and she should be monitored for Still's disease. Her hypothyroidism is being treated with levothyroxine, but her TSH is low and free T4 is normal. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest sepsis. The source of infection has not been identified yet.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is on IV steroids for presumed relative adrenal insufficiency. This condition can cause hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Tuberculosis reactivation: There is a concern for tuberculosis reactivation, especially given the patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has diarrhea and a history of colitis. There is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and abdominal pain.
5. Tooth abscess: The patient had a tooth abscess that was removed, but there could still be a risk of infection spreading or complications from the dental procedure.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and her TSH level is low despite normal free T4 levels. This may require further evaluation and adjustment of her thyroid medication.
7. Still's disease exacerbation: The patient has a history of Still's disease, and her symptoms could be related to an exacerbation of this condition.
8. Lymphoma: There is a concern for lymphoma, and the patient is awaiting bi"

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She presented with malaise and fevers and was readmitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient has been diagnosed with relative adrenal insufficiency and is currently being treated with IV steroids. Her blood pressure has been stable with SBPs ranging from 80 to 100. The patient also has a submandibular/jaw lesion, diarrhea, transaminitis, and a tooth abscess that was removed on [11-19]. There is suspicion of lymphoma or tuberculosis reactivation. She has been started on antibiotics for a presumptive odontogenic abscess and Clostridium difficile infection. A CT scan showed evidence of colitis. The patient's hemoglobin, anemia, and coagulopathy are stable but require monitoring. Her HIV treatment should continue. The patient's joint pain is consistent with Still's Disease, and her thyroid levels are within normal range. The patient has multiple medical complications and is receiving appropriate care in the ICU."

   methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper (on Bactrim prophylaxis);
   is admitted with one week h/o fatigue, malaise; cough non productive;
   NV; LT neck swelling.  She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile
   without clear source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite
   negative c.dif.
   >Fever/Hypotension: unclear source to fevers and hypotension although
   oodotogenic infection in a immunocompromised host on MTX/ Steroids
   looms at the leading cause. she has some reactive lymphadenopathy on
   the right side of the jaw. Could be consistent with dental
   carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes which we are
   covering with broad spectrum Abx. And we have now extracted the tooth.
   There is also a possibility that this could represent re-crudescence of
   her Still's disease (increasing ferritin), notably she got worse when
   she was changed to prednisone PO. Lymphoma with rising LDH also a
   concern. CT scan of the chest is not at all consistent with PCP (neg
   induced sputum). Her diarrhea conts and we are empirically treating c.
   dif (despite 3 neg , she has a hx of c. dif) her CT scan is consistent
   with ileitis and in this immunocomprimised (despite normal CD4 count)
   dx such as cryptosporidium (although neg on DFA), CMV as well as
   reactivation TB. Her significant increase in ferritin is again very
   concerning for recrudescent Still

She presents with one week of fatigue, malaise, non-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever.

Assessment and plan:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3 on HAART. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, which she is being treated with methotrexate and steroids. The patient presents with symptoms including fatigue, malaise, nonproductive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, her fever and hypotension persist. She also has marked diarrhea, which has been negative for Clostridium difficile. The patient's white blood cell count is improving, and she has a marked bandemia. Her abdominal exam is not reassuring, especially considering her high-dose steroid use. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of her symptoms, including gastrointestinal consultation for ileitis, repeat imaging, colonoscopy, and ongoing monitoring of her condition."

infected female with recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3

   methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper (on Bactrim prophylaxis);
   is admitted with one week h/o fatigue, malaise; cough non productive;
   NV; LT neck swelling.  She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile
   without clear source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite
   negative c.dif.
   >Fever/Hypotension: unclear source to fevers and hypotension although
   oodotogenic infection in a immunocompromised host on MTX/ Steroids
   looms at the leading cause. she has some reactive lymphadenopathy on
   the right side of the jaw. Could be consistent with dental
   carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes which we are
   covering with broad spectrum Abx. And we have now extracted the tooth.
   There is also a possibility that this could represent re-crudescence of
   her Still's disease (increasing ferritin), notably she got worse when
   she was changed to prednisone PO. Lymphoma with rising LDH also a
   concern. CT scan of the chest is not at all consistent with PCP (neg
   induced sputum). Her diarrhea conts and we are empirically treating c.
   dif (despite 3 neg , she has a hx of c. dif) her CT scan is consistent
   with ileitis and in this immunocomprimised (despite normal CD4 count)
   dx such as cryptosporidium (although neg on DFA), CMV as well as
   reactivation TB. Her significant increase in ferritin is again very
   concerning for recrudescent Still
s disease vs lymphoma in addition to
   an infection,
   - Colonoscopy with clx /bx [**11-21**]
   - check lactate and LFTs (nl)
   - Will cont to discuss with Rheumatology (her wbc has increased again)

   >Metabolic acidosos: elevated lactate but also concern for loss of HCO3
   in the stool from diarrhea. Will check urine lytes (for urine anion

","The patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3 on HAART. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, which she is being treated with methotrexate and steroids. She was admitted with symptoms of fatigue, malaise, nonproductive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever without a clear source.

Her assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:
1. Fever/Hypotension: The source of the fever and hypotension is unclear, but an odontogenic infection in an immunocompromised host on MTX/Steroids is a leading cause. She has reactive lymphadenopathy on the right side of the jaw, which could be consistent with dental carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the tooth has been extracted.
2. Recrudescence of Still's Disease: There is a possibility that her symptoms represent a re-crudescence of her Still's disease, especially with the increasing ferritin levels. She worsened when changed to prednisone PO.
3. Lymphoma: Rising LDH levels are concerning for lymphoma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She presents with malaise and fevers and has been readmitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, concerning for sepsis with an unknown source. The patient's blood pressure has stabilized and she is now on IV steroids. She has a submandibular/jaw lesion, positive for lymphadenopathy (LAD), and is experiencing diarrhea and transaminitis. A tooth abscess was previously removed, and there is a possibility of lymphoma or Still's Disease involvement. A CT scan showed evidence of colitis. The patient underwent a colonoscopy with biopsies pending, which were unremarkable. She is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole for pan coverage, including an odontogenic abscess and presumptive Clostridium difficile infection. The ID team is questioning tuberculosis reactivation and plans to follow up on the colon biopsies for tuberculosis assessment. The patient's coagulopathy remains elevated but stable, with an unclear cause. Her HIV treatment should continue with HAART. Joint pain and constitutional symptoms may be related to Still's Disease, previously treated with prednisone and methotrexate. Rheum input is needed regarding IV steroid management.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She was readmitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, raising concerns for sepsis with an unknown source. Her blood pressure has been stable, ranging from 80 to 100 mmHg, and she is being treated with IV steroids. The patient also has a submandibular/jaw lesion, diarrhea, transaminitis, and a tooth abscess that was removed on 11/19. There is also a suspicion of lymphoma or Still's disease-related colitis, as indicated by a CT scan on 11/18. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for a potential odontogenic abscess and presumptive Clostridioides difficile infection. The ID team is questioning the possibility of tuberculosis reactivation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, increased hematocrit, and prolonged clotting time. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies, such as CXRs and a colonoscopy with biopsies of the cecum and ascending colon, are pending.

Plan:

1. Treat sepsis with unknown source using broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco, Zosyn, Flagyl).
2. Continue IV steroids for presumed relative adrenal insufficiency.
3. Monitor and maintain mean arterial pressure ("

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old HIV
infected female with recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3
   ([**2192-8-10**]) on HAART, h/o thyroid disease; h/o adult Stills disease on
   methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper (on Bactrim prophylaxis);
   is admitted with one week h/o fatigue, malaise; cough non productive;
   NV; LT neck swelling.  She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile
   without clear source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite
   negative c.dif and is not s/p a macroscopically neg [**Last Name (un) **], but we are
   awaiting the results of the bx/infectious work up.
   >Fever/Hypotension: unclear source to fevers and hypotension although
   oodotogenic infection in a immunocompromised host on MTX/ Steroids
   looms at the leading cause. she has some reactive lymphadenopathy on
   the right side of the jaw. Could be consistent with dental
   carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes which we are
   covering with broad spectrum Abx. And we have now extracted the tooth.
   There is also a possibility that this could represent re-crudescence of
   her Still's disease (increasing ferritin), notably she got worse when
   she was changed to prednisone PO. Lymphoma with rising LDH also a
   concern. CT scan of the chest is not at all consistent with PCP (neg
   induced sputum). Her diarrhea conts and we are empirically treating c.
   dif (despite 3 neg , she has a hx of c. dif) her CT scan is consistent
   with ileitis and in this immunocomprimised (despite normal CD4 count)
   dx such as cryptosporidium (although neg on DFA), CMV as well as
   reactivation TB and we await the results of her bx on [**Last Name (un) **]. Her
   significant increase in ferritin is again very concerning for
   recrudescent Still
s disease vs lymphoma in addition to an infection.
   We will cont to follow closely the CBC for evolution into
   hemophagocytic syndrome (following  Plts).
   - Stop Vanco and Zosyn (s/p a 7 day course), cont flagyl for c. dif
   awaiting repeat test [**11-22**]
   - Colonoscopy with clx /bx [**11-21**]: f/u results
   - Will cont to discuss with Rheumatology (her wbc has increased again)
   and marked increased in ferritin over the last 24 hrs. Will need to
   discuss whether she needs increasing steroid doses
   - ID following (appreciate input)
   - Follow up blood and urine clx (all results neg to date). Stool clx
   have been neg to date.
   - Cont to stress dose steroids.
   - MAP goal > 60 mmHg (fluid bolus with PR as needed, baseline BP is
   90-100/60mmHg)
   - Ehrlicia and thin-thick smear (neg), histoplasmosis (pend),
   strongyloides (pend).
   -  F/u urine histo Ag.
   > Hypoxemia: relatively clear CXR and resp alkaosis on ABG. Neg PE
   protocol CT scan [**11-18**]). Increasing tachypnea, she has been in bed since
   her arrival, her exam is consistent with atlectasis. This is compounded
   by her hypokalemia and hypophos/mag.
   - Check sputum clx
   - Pulm toilet, OOB to chair,. CXR today
   - Optimize electrolytes Mg, K, PO4
   - her coags (both apt and INR are up): ? antii-phospholipid Ab syndrome
   awaiting labs
    Thrombocytopenia: ? hemophagocytic syndrome, medications (vanco? Which
   we are stopping today), heparin (on for 8 days now)  and PPI
   - repeat CBC and if plts lower then check HIT.
   > Coagulopathy: unclear reason to explain aPTT and INR increases. Will
   check aPL work up.

   without clear source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite
   negative c.dif and is not s/p a macroscopically neg [**Last Name (un) **], but we are
   awaiting the results of the bx/infectious work up.
   >Fever/Hypotension: unclear source to fevers and hypotension although
   oodotogenic infection in a immunocompromised host on MTX/ Steroids
   looms at the leading cause. she has some reactive lymphadenopathy on
   the right side of the jaw. Could be consistent with dental
   carry/abscess with local drainage to affected nodes which we are
   covering with broad spectrum Abx. And we have now extracted the tooth.
   There is also a possibility that this could represent re-crudescence of
   her Still's disease (increasing ferritin), notably she got worse when
   she was changed to prednisone PO. Lymphoma with rising LDH also a
   concern. CT scan of the chest is not at all consistent with PCP (neg
   induced sputum). Her diarrhea conts and we are empirically treating c.
   dif (despite 3 neg , she has a hx of c. dif) her CT scan is consistent
   with ileitis and in this immunocomprimised (despite normal CD4 count)
   dx such as cryptosporidium (although neg on DFA), CMV as well as
   reactivation TB and we await the results of her bx on [**Last Name (un) **]. Her
   significant increase in ferritin is again very concerning for
   recrudescent Still
s disease vs lymphoma in addition to an infection.
   We will cont to follow closely the CBC for evolution into
   hemophagocytic syndrome (following  Plts).
   - Stop Vanco and Zosyn (s/p a 7 day course), cont flagyl for c. dif
   awaiting repeat test [**11-22**]
   - Colonoscopy with clx /bx [**11-21**]: f/u results
   - Will cont to discuss with Rheumatology (her wbc has increased again)
   and marked increased in ferritin over the last 24 hrs. Will need to
   discuss whether she needs increasing steroid doses

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3.
- She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, currently on methotrexate maintenance with a steroid taper.
- She is admitted with symptoms of fatigue, malaise, non-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever without a clear source.
- The patient continues to have marked diarrhea despite negative c. difficile test results.
- She underwent colonoscopy with biopsy on 11/21.
- Her vital signs show tachypnea and hypotension.
- She has reactive lymphadenopathy on the right side of the jaw, which could be consistent with a dental abscess.
- She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically.
- Her CT scan of the chest is not consistent with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
- Her diarrhea may be caused by cryptosporidium, CMV, reactivation TB, or another infection.
- Her ferritin levels are significantly increased, raising concerns for recrudescent Still's disease or lymphoma.
- The patient's WBC count has increased again, and she has marked increased ferritin over the last 24 hours.
- She requires further discussion with Rheumatology regarding steroid doses.
- She is at risk for developing hemophagocytic syndrome.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3 on HAART. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease, for which she is receiving methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper. The patient was admitted with one week of fatigue, malaise, nonproductive cough, nausea, vomiting, left neck swelling, recurrent hypotension, and fever without a clear source. She has marked diarrhea despite negative C. difficile test results. The patient has been treated empirically for C. difficile and is being covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics due to a suspected odontogenic infection in an immunocompromised host. A tooth extraction was performed. The patient's symptoms and test results are concerning for possible recurrent Still's disease, lymphoma, or an infection such as cryptosporidium, CMV, or reactivation TB. The patient's significant increase in ferritin levels is concerning for recurrent Still's disease or lymphoma. The patient's white blood cell count has increased again, and marked increased ferritin over the last 24 hours needs to be discussed with Rheumatology. Other medical complications that could arise include hypoxemia, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's disposition is"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 year old HIV
infected female with recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3
   ([**2192-8-10**]) on HAART, h/o thyroid disease; h/o adult Stills disease on
   methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper (on Bactrim prophylaxis);
   is admitted with one week h/o fatigue, malaise; cough non productive;
   NV;.  She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile without clear
   source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite negative c.dif and is
   not s/p a macroscopically neg [**Last Name (un) **]. It remains unclear with unclear why
   her platelets are dropping.
   >Fever/Hypotension:  After a very thourough evaluation for infection
   the only source has been odontogenic s./p tooth extraction and
   improvement in cervical adenopathy. She remains intermittently
   hypotensive and febrile with persistent diarrhea s/p a macroscopically
   normal colonoscopy (no inclusion bodies for CMV although cultures are
   pending). It remains unclear with her high ferritin if this picture
   could be consistent with Stills disease with possible hemophagocytic
   syndrome (given the fall in platelets). All abx have been stopped
   (Vanco and Zosyn [**11-22**]) and metronidazole [**11-23**]. There is no clear
   lymphadenopathy that is clearly amenable to biopsy at this point.
   - Will cont to discuss with Rheumatology marked increased in ferritin
   over the last 24 hrs. Will need to discuss whether she needs increasing
   steroid dose. Will recheck triglycerides
   - ID following (appreciate input)
   - Cont to stress dose steroids.
   - Ehrlicia and thin-thick smear (neg), histoplasmosis (pend),
   strongyloides (pend).
   -  F/u urine histo Ag (pending).
   > Diarrhea: no obvious source. Will try to control symptoms with
   immodium. Other more unusual causes of secretory diarrhea seem less
   likely. Cont to closely follow electrolytes
   - follow lytes closely.
   > Hypoxemia: increasingly vol overload CXR. Neg PE protocol CT scan
   [**11-18**]). Increasing tachypnea, she has been in bed since her arrival, her
   exam is consistent with atlectasis. This is compounded by her
   hypokalemia and hypophos/mag and mild vol overloaded.
   - Check sputum clx
   - Pulm toilet, OOB to chair,.
   - Optimize electrolytes Mg, K, PO4
   - her coags (both apt and INR are up): ? antii-phospholipid Ab syndrome
   awaiting labs
    Thrombocytopenia: ? hemophagocytic syndrome, medications (Stopped
   Vanco), heparin (Hold heparin, checking HIT)  and PPI
   - Will f/u HIT Ab, holding heparin and changing PPI to H2
   > Coagulopathy: unclear reason to explain aPTT and INR increases. aPL
   work up pending
   - Vit K s/p 3 days

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old HIV-infected female with a recent CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3 on HAART. She has a history of thyroid disease and adult Still's disease on methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper, and is currently admitted with symptoms including fatigue, malaise, non-productive cough, nausea, and vomiting. She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile without a clear source, and continues to have marked diarrhea despite negative C. difficile test results. Her platelets are dropping, and the cause is unclear. The patient remains intermittently hypotensive and febrile with persistent diarrhea after a macroscopically normal colonoscopy. Her high ferritin levels raise the possibility of Still's disease with possible hemophagocytic syndrome. All antibiotics have been stopped, and cultures are pending. The patient will be discussed with Rheumatology regarding the marked increase in ferritin over the last 24 hours and whether she needs an increased steroid dose. There are multiple other issues to follow up on, including hypoxemia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and HIV management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Hypotension: The patient remains intermittently hypotensive and febrile with persistent diarrhea. It remains unclear why her platelets are dropping.
2. Diarrhea: No obvious source has been identified for the patient's diarrhea. Unusual causes of"

   the only source has been odontogenic s./p tooth extraction and
   improvement in cervical adenopathy. She remains intermittently
   hypotensive and febrile with persistent diarrhea s/p a macroscopically
   normal colonoscopy (no inclusion bodies for CMV although cultures are
   pending). It remains unclear with her high ferritin if this picture
   could be consistent with Stills disease with possible hemophagocytic
   syndrome (given the fall in platelets). All abx have been stopped
   (Vanco and Zosyn [**11-22**]) and metronidazole [**11-23**]. There is no clear
   lymphadenopathy that is clearly amenable to biopsy at this point.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with an unknown chief complaint, who is currently in the ICU. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/58 to 132/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and is unable to stand. The physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin without rash, and normal neurologic examination. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and previous antibiotic use suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,239 mL and output of 4,630 mL over the past 24 hours. This indicates a potential fluid deficit of 609 mL. Regular assessment of the patient's fluid status and appropriate fluid management are crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease. She presents with malaise, fevers, and hypotension, leading to readmission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). The patient is currently being treated for a possible sepsis of unknown origin. She has been stable on IV steroids and is being closely monitored for any signs of hypotension or infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia raises concerns for sepsis. The source of infection remains unidentified, and appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. Close monitoring of vital signs and frequent reassessment of the patient's condition are essential.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypotension has resolved with IV steroids, suggesting a possible relative adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation and management are necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has been treated with vancomycin and zosyn for a presumptive C. diff infection. However, the results are pending, and flagyl has been stopped as C. diff is negative. It is important to continue monitoring the patient for any signs or symptoms of C. diff infection.

4. Tooth abscess: The patient has been treated for an odontogenic abscess. Ongoing evaluation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She presents with malaise and fevers, and is readmitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, with concerns for sepsis of unknown origin. The patient has been stable on IV steroids and is receiving IV fluids to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-12. Her lactate levels are being rechecked.

The patient has been treated for a submandibular/jaw infection, diarrhea, transaminitis, and tooth abscess. She underwent a colonoscopy and biopsies are pending, with no significant findings except for possible colitis seen on CT. The patient is being followed by the ID team, and plans are to discontinue vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam after a 7-day course. Flagyl will be continued until Clostridium difficile (C. diff) results return negative.

The patient has anemia and coagulopathy, which are stable but unclear. She is being treated for HIV with HAART, and her thyroid levels are being monitored. The patient is also being evaluated for Still's Disease, with abnormal laboratory results indicating possible lymphoma or rheumatoid arthritis.

The patient has malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances,"

   Disease mtx and prednisone taper presented with fever, admitted to
   Medicine floor, now transferred to MICU for hypotension and
   tachycardia.
      Pt was in [**Hospital **] clinic [**11-15**], reported fatigue, malaise for past month,
   with low grade fevers, mostly at night with occasional night sweats.
   Five days PTA, developed semi-productive cough, also a tender
   ""swelling"" under her chin. Was febrile and tachycardic in clinic, no O2
   requirement, admitted directly to CC7.
   Pt diagnosed with HIV [**2174**] after fiance +, no treatment. In [**2187**],
   started on study protocol (Gilead 934 study: Tefavirenz, emtriva,
   tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), treated since at [**Hospital1 19**], +compliance.
   MAC prophylaxis [**12/2187**] (azithromycin), then stopped [**12-13**]. Had
   admission [**Date range (3) 3313**] for hyperthyroidism with subsequent iodine
   ablation. Tested PPD+ [**11/2189**], underwent 9 months of INH treatment.
      She was admitted to the floor but triggered for hypotension and was
   transferred to the MICU for resuscitation. She was empirically covered
   with broad spectrum abx. She received stress dose steroids of HC 50 q6
   but then switched to prednisone 60 mg daily. The leading source to the
   fever has been dental abscess with reaction submental lymphnodes.
   Additional source to infection has been attributed to Still's disease
   given her markedly elevated ferritin. She never required vasopressors
   for hemodynamic support. She is scheduled for tooth extraction on
   Monday. She was intermittently tachypneic but had no chest pain,
   subjective shortness of breath or detectable hypoxia. Micro data has
   remained negative to date. Upon arrival to the floor she was febrile to
   103 and triggerred for RR 40 without subjective shortness of breath.
   She received a total of 3.5l IVF for borderline low SBPs (80s), then
   had a SBP to 65, which prompted a trigger.  ABG was drawn, which showed
   lactate >3, prompting MICU transfer.

   ([**2192-8-10**]) on HAART, h/o thyroid disease; h/o adult Stills disease on
   methotrexate maintenance with steroid taper (on Bactrim prophylaxis);
   is admitted with one week h/o fatigue, malaise; cough non productive;
   NV;.  She has been recurrently hypotensive and febrile without clear
   source. She conts to have marked diarrhea despite negative c.dif and is
   not s/p a macroscopically neg [**Last Name (un) **]. It remains unclear with unclear why
   her platelets are dropping.
   >Fever/Hypotension:  After a very thourough evaluation for infection
   the only source has been odontogenic s./p tooth extraction and
   improvement in cervical adenopathy. She remains intermittently
   hypotensive and febrile with persistent diarrhea s/p a macroscopically
   normal colonoscopy (no inclusion bodies for CMV and CMV Cx neg). It
   remains unclear with her high ferritin if this picture could be
   consistent with Stills disease with possible hemophagocytic syndrome
   (given the fall in platelets). All abx have been stopped (Vanco and
   Zosyn [**11-22**]) and metronidazole [**11-23**]. There is no clear lymphadenopathy
   that is clearly amenable to biopsy at this point.
   - Will cont to discuss with Rheumatology marked increased in ferritin
   over the last 24 hrs. Will need to discuss whether she needs increasing
   steroid dose. Will recheck triglycerides
   - ID following (appreciate input)
   - Cont to stress dose steroids.
   - Ehrlicia and thin-thick smear (neg), histoplasmosis (pend),

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV infection, undetectable viral load, CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease. She presented with fever and submental mass/lump and was initially admitted to the medicine floor for hypotension and tachycardia. The patient developed a cough, tender swelling under her chin, and was subsequently transferred to the MICU for resuscitation.

The patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of HIV in [**2174**], initiation of HAART therapy, and prophylaxis for MAC. She also had an admission for hyperthyroidism with subsequent iodine ablation and tested positive for PPD, undergoing 9 months of INH treatment. The patient has a history of shingles and chronic inflammatory condition called Still's disease, for which she is on prednisone and methotrexate.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103°F, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/79 to 65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids and has received stress dose steroids.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophils predominating, elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and decreased platelet count. Imaging studies"

   Disease mtx and prednisone taper presented with fever, admitted to
   Medicine floor, now transferred to MICU for hypotension and
   tachycardia.
      Pt was in [**Hospital **] clinic [**11-15**], reported fatigue, malaise for past month,
   with low grade fevers, mostly at night with occasional night sweats.
   Five days PTA, developed semi-productive cough, also a tender
   ""swelling"" under her chin. Was febrile and tachycardic in clinic, no O2
   requirement, admitted directly to CC7.
   Pt diagnosed with HIV [**2174**] after fiance +, no treatment. In [**2187**],
   started on study protocol (Gilead 934 study: Tefavirenz, emtriva,
   tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), treated since at [**Hospital1 19**], +compliance.
   MAC prophylaxis [**12/2187**] (azithromycin), then stopped [**12-13**]. Had
   admission [**Date range (3) 3313**] for hyperthyroidism with subsequent iodine
   ablation. Tested PPD+ [**11/2189**], underwent 9 months of INH treatment.
      She was admitted to the floor but triggered for hypotension and was
   transferred to the MICU for resuscitation. She was empirically covered
   with broad spectrum abx. She received stress dose steroids of HC 50 q6
   but then switched to prednisone 60 mg daily. The leading source to the
   fever has been dental abscess with reaction submental lymphnodes.
   Additional source to infection has been attributed to Still's disease
   given her markedly elevated ferritin. She never required vasopressors
   for hemodynamic support. She is scheduled for tooth extraction on
   Monday. She was intermittently tachypneic but had no chest pain,
   subjective shortness of breath or detectable hypoxia. Micro data has
   remained negative to date. Upon arrival to the floor she was febrile to
   103 and triggerred for RR 40 without subjective shortness of breath.
   She received a total of 3.5l IVF for borderline low SBPs (80s), then
   had a SBP to 65, which prompted a trigger.  ABG was drawn, which showed
   lactate >3, prompting MICU transfer.

   improvement in cervical adenopathy. She remains intermittently
   hypotensive and febrile with persistent diarrhea s/p a macroscopically
   normal colonoscopy (no inclusion bodies for CMV although cultures are

   could be consistent with Stills disease with possible hemophagocytic
   syndrome (given the fall in platelets). All abx have been stopped

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, undetectable viral load, CD4 count of 166 cells/mm3, hypothyroidism, and Still's disease. She presented with fever and submental mass, which was initially thought to be a dental abscess. She is currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia. The leading source of fever has been identified as a dental abscess with reaction submental lymph nodes. Additional sources of infection have been attributed to Still's disease, given her markedly elevated ferritin levels. The patient is scheduled for tooth extraction on Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemophagocytic syndrome: The patient's high ferritin levels, drop in platelets, and persistent fever may suggest a possible hemophagocytic syndrome, which can be associated with Still's disease.
2. Diarrhea: The patient continues to experience diarrhea despite negative C. difficile testing and macroscopically normal colonoscopy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been dropping. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, and further investigation is required.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an increased aPTT and INR, indicating coagulopathy. The cause of this coagulopathy is unclear, and further evaluation is needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She was readmitted to the MICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, suspected to be sepsis but with unknown source. The patient's hypotension resolved with IV steroids. Her blood pressure has been stable since then, with SBPs ranging from 95-100 mmHg. The etiology of her low blood pressure is relative adrenal insufficiency versus baseline low blood pressure.

The patient underwent a tooth abscess removal on 11/19, and completed a 7-day course of antibiotics (Vanco, Zosyn, Flagyl) for her fever. She is now off all antibiotics as of 11/23. There is no identifiable source of infection, and further evaluation is needed.

The patient has a baseline low hematocrit, normocytic anemia, and elevated coagulopathy. Her platelet count is dropping, but it is unclear if it is due to medication effect or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). A HIT panel was negative. The patient's coagulation parameters are stabilizing, but she has not discontinued hepatic squamous and protonix.

The patient's HIV management includes continuing HAART therapy. She also has Still's Disease, which is causing joint pain and constitutional symptoms. Previously treated with prednisone"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of HIV, hypothyroidism, and Still's Disease. She was initially admitted to the ICU with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, raising concerns for sepsis. The patient's blood pressure has been stable on IV steroids, but there is concern for relative adrenal insufficiency or baseline low blood pressure. The source of infection remains unidentified, and the patient has been treated for various possibilities including an odontogenic abscess, c.difficile infection, and presumptive tuberculosis. Colonoscopy results were unremarkable, but biopsies are pending. The patient's anemia and coagulopathy are stable, and her platelet count is dropping. She is also being treated for hypothyroidism and malnutrition with aggressive electrolyte repletion. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis, including fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. Although her blood pressure is currently stable, there is still a risk of recurrent or ongoing infection.
2. Relative Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's stable blood pressure on IV steroids suggests relative adrenal insufficiency. It is important to monitor her response to steroid treatment and adjust dosages accordingly.
3. Unknown Infection Source: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and other treatments, the source of infection remains unidentified. Continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. They started taking Imodium and experienced dizziness when out of bed, so they were placed back in bed. The patient has electrolyte imbalances with low potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, which are being repleted. There is an increased urine output, and a urine osmolality test is being sent to assess for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Rheumatology recommendations include sending a ferritin test and considering a change to oral steroids, specifically prednisone at 40mg daily. Infectious disease recommendations include sending a stool sample to check for microsporidia. The patient has no known drug allergies and has received piperacillin, vancomycin, and metronidazole antibiotics.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/79mmHg to 132/79mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,614 mL and output of 7,470 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,856 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///28/. Physical examination findings include"
