","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fever, and thrombocytopenia. She has a history of taking tramadol illegally and has admitted to using other substances as well. The patient's platelet count is low, and her renal function is impaired. She also has evidence of liver involvement and a possible urinary tract infection. The patient's condition is complex and requires further evaluation and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, which can lead to acute renal failure if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring of urine output and daily creatinine levels is necessary.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Transfusion may be required to maintain a healthy platelet count and prevent bleeding complications.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be due to encephalopathy, delirium, or meningoencephalitis. A lumbar puncture may be performed once the platelet count is above 80,000 to rule out meningoencephalitis. Empirical coverage with antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone) and antiviral therapy (acyclovir) is being provided.
4. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be related to an ongoing infection. Blood and"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 121/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination findings include agitation and emotional distress, bilateral rales in the lower lung fields, and livedo reticularis on her lower extremities. The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 41 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal cardiomegaly and possible interstitial lung disease on chest X-ray. The patient's renal ultrasound shows evidence of fatty liver and moderate hydronephrosis on the"

   Assessment and Plan
   59F with a h/o tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status with
   thrombocytopenia, now with respiratory failure.
   # Shock: Septic vs cardiogenic.  Pressors started after SPB dropped to
   80s.  CVP 15-16 with mixed venous sat 74  therefore more likely [**12-31**]
   sepsis.  On Levophed.  Source likely lungs also known UTI.  Being
   treated emperically for meningo-encephalitis with
   ceftiaxone/vanc/acyclovir.
   - IVF may be given in small boluses with careful monitoring of
   respiratory status
   - continue antibiotics
   - MAP goal >65
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   # Respiratory failure: Worsening respiratory status and hypoxia and
   intubated.  Multifocal PNA on CT, abx coverage expanded to cover
   anaerobes and pseudomonas with cipro/flagyl in addition to
   vanc/ceftriaxone being given emperically for meningitis.  Also given
   low EF concern for pulmonary edema.  CXR after intubation yesterday
   concerning for aspiration with increased retrocardiac opacity.
   - continue abx
   # Cardiac dysfunction/pericardial effusion: decreased systolic function
   with no known history of cardiac disease.  EKG and cardiac enzymes
   negative for actue ischemia.  Moderate effusion without tamponade
   physiology.  CVP not consistant with cardiogenic shock.
   - cards consult
   # Altered Mental Status: Subacute process with acute decline.
   Clinically appears like encephalopathy given the component of
   behavioral changes, daytime somnolence, and agitation.  In the setting
   of fevers, delirium and menigo-encephalitis are also on the
   differential.  Also could be related to a toxic ingestion-she admits to
   both tramadol and ativan, but cannot give a full history, and her tox
   screens from urine and blood are both negative.   CT head negative.
   Consider thyroid dysfunction. Emperic tx for meningoencephalitis with
   acyclovir, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone.
   - Lumbar puncture, consider IR given h/o spinal stenosis
   - f/u TSH
   - Toxicology c/s: : tramadol can be associated with seizures but
   unlikely cause of thrombocytopenia, continue supportive care
   - HIV consent when patient has capacity
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt has an isolated thrombocytopenia.  Not
   TTP/DIC.  No significant splenomegaly on abdominal ultrasound.  ITP is
   also a possibility but usually doesn
t present with such low plts.
   Viiral etiologies possible
 work up for HIV, HCV, HSV, EBV, CMV.
   Lastly, this could be a problem of production or destruction related to
   her toxic ingestion.  She is taking an unknown substance (tramadol
   purchased over the internet illegally), perhaps there are other toxic
   substances present.  There are case reports of tramadol-associated
   thrombocytopenia, however, this would be very rare.  S/p 4U platelets
   - Transfuse to maintain HCt > 50, transfuse as needed to prevent risk
   of bleeding
   - HIV consent
   - F/u viral serologies, EBV, CMV, HCV
   - F/u heme/onc
   #. Acute renal failure: In the setting of somnolence (and thus reduced
   access to free water), and infection, most likelly pre-renal failure.
   Had granular casts on OSH sediment, which raises some suspicion for a
   component of ATN.  FeNa 0.13%. Decreased UOP overnight.
   - Continue to monitor UOP with goal 35-50cc/hr, may carefully give IVF
   - Renally dose meds, follow  daily creatinines
   - Trial of low dose antipsychotic?
   #. Anemia: - hct 37->34->30, stable, no evidence of bleed on CT
   - Continue to monitor daily
   #. Hydronephrosis: Found incidentally on renal ultrasound, moderate on
   the left.  Has a history of nephrolithiasis. Now with obstructing stone
   on L 6x5mm.
   - Should pass...
   #. Transaminitis: U/s with evidence of fatty liver, also likely an
   acute phase reaction in the setting of infection
   - Follow LFTs daily
   #. Acidosis: no acedemia, bicarb low but lactate normal, tox screen
   negative
   - continue hydration as tolerated and monitor
   #. Hydronephrosis: Found incidentally on renal ultrasound, moderate on
   the left.  Has a history of nephrolithiasis.
   #. Substance abuse: SW c/s, psych to see when extubated
   #. Depression: Holding fluoxetine for now.  Psych c/s as above.
   #. FEN: lytes and replete as tolerated,

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status, who is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated due to worsening respiratory status and hypoxia. 

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock given the drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) to the 80s and the presence of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 74%. This indicates poor tissue perfusion. The patient is being treated empirically for meningo-encephalitis with antibiotics (ceftiaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir), and the source of infection is likely the lungs, known as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, leading to intubation. Multifocal pneumonia is seen on the CT scan, and antibiotic coverage has been expanded to cover anaerobes and pseudomonas, in addition to the current medications. 

3. Cardiac dysfunction/pericardial effusion: The patient has decreased systolic function with no known history of cardiac disease. An echocardiogram shows moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. 

4. Altered mental status: The patient has a subacute process with acute decline in"

   with consequent left hydroureter and hydronephrosis. Multifocal
   bilateral pulmonary consolidations, concerning for multifocal
   pneumonia. Moderate pericardial effusion. Diffuse fatty infiltration of
   the liver.
   ECHO:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
   [**9-12**] %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal
   hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
   (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is a small to moderate sized
   circumferential pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
   signs of tamponade.

   Assessment and Plan
   59F with a h/o tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status with
   thrombocytopenia, now with respiratory failure.
   # Shock: Septic vs cardiogenic.  Pressors started after SPB dropped to
   80s.  CVP 15-16 with mixed venous sat 74  therefore more likely [**12-31**]
   sepsis.  On Levophed.  Source likely lungs also known UTI.  Being
   treated emperically for meningo-encephalitis with
   ceftiaxone/vanc/acyclovir.
   - IVF may be given in small boluses with careful monitoring of
   respiratory status
   - continue antibiotics
   - ID consult
   - MAP goal >65
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   # Respiratory failure: Worsening respiratory status and hypoxia and
   intubated.  Multifocal PNA on CT, abx coverage expanded to cover
   anaerobes and pseudomonas with cipro/flagyl in addition to
   vanc/ceftriaxone being given emperically for meningitis.  Also given
   low EF concern for pulmonary edema.  CXR after intubation yesterday
   concerning for aspiration with increased retrocardiac opacity.
   - continue abx
   - bronch today
   # Cardiac dysfunction/pericardial effusion: decreased systolic function
   with no known history of cardiac disease.  EKG and cardiac enzymes
   negative for actue ischemia.  Moderate effusion without tamponade
   physiology.  CVP not consistant with cardiogenic shock.
   - cards consult
   # Altered Mental Status: Subacute process with acute decline.
   Clinically appears like encephalopathy given the component of
   behavioral changes, daytime somnolence, and agitation.  In the setting
   of fevers, delirium and menigo-encephalitis are also on the
   differential.  Also could be related to a toxic ingestion-she admits to
   both tramadol and ativan, but cannot give a full history, and her tox
   screens from urine and blood are both negative.   CT head negative.
   Consider thyroid dysfunction. Emperic tx for meningoencephalitis with
   acyclovir, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone. TSH 25
   - Lumbar puncture, consider IR given h/o spinal stenosis, give plts to
   count >80
   -  thyroid function tests, cortisol
   - Toxicology c/s: : tramadol can be associated with seizures but
   unlikely cause of thrombocytopenia, continue supportive care
   - HIV consent when patient has capacity
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt has an isolated thrombocytopenia.  Not
   TTP/DIC.  No significant splenomegaly on abdominal ultrasound.  ITP is
   also a possibility but usually doesn
t present with such low plts.
   Viiral etiologies possible
 work up for HIV, HCV, HSV, EBV, CMV.
   Lastly, this could be a problem of production or destruction related to
   her toxic ingestion.  She is taking an unknown substance (tramadol
   purchased over the internet illegally), perhaps there are other toxic
   substances present.  There are case reports of tramadol-associated
   thrombocytopenia, however, this would be very rare.  S/p 4U platelets
   - Transfuse to maintain HCt > 50, transfuse as needed to prevent risk
   of bleeding
   - HIV consent, needs formal ethics c/s if husband
   - F/u viral serologies, EBV, CMV, HCV
   - F/u heme/onc
   #. Acute renal failure: In the setting of somnolence (and thus reduced
   access to free water), and infection, most likelly pre-renal failure.
   Had granular casts on OSH sediment, which raises some suspicion for a
   component of ATN.  FeNa 0.13%. Decreased UOP overnight.
   - Continue to monitor UOP with goal 35-50cc/hr, may carefully give IVF
   - Renally dose meds, follow  daily creatinines
   - Trial of low dose antipsychotic?
   #. Anemia: - hct 37->34->30, stable, no evidence of bleed on CT
   - Continue to monitor daily
   #. Hydronephrosis: Found incidentally on renal ultrasound, moderate on
   the left.  Has a history of nephrolithiasis. Now with obstructing stone
   on L 6x5mm.  Concern for infection behind stone
   -  Urology c/s
   #. Transaminitis: U/s with evidence of fatty liver, also likely an
   acute phase reaction in the setting of infection
   - Follow LFTs daily
   #. Acidosis: no acedemia, bicarb low but lactate normal, tox screen
   negative
   - continue hydration as tolerated and monitor
   #. Substance abuse: SW c/s, psych to see when extubated
   #. Depression: Holding fluoxetine for now.  Psych c/s as above.
   #. FEN: lytes and replete as tolerated,
   #. PPX
   - does she need DVT prophylaxis?  No subq heparin per heme/onc, no
   pneumoboots per her liveta

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of tramadol abuse, who presented with subacute altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, and respiratory failure. She has been intubated due to worsening respiratory status and hypoxia. The CT chest/abdomen revealed an obstructive left ureteral stone causing left hydronephrosis, multifocal bilateral pulmonary consolidations suggestive of multifocal pneumonia, moderate pericardial effusion, and diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. An echocardiogram showed severe global depressed left ventricular systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction of 10-15%. The patient is also experiencing anemia, acidosis, and renal failure. She is being treated empirically for meningitis with antibiotics and antivirals. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely in septic shock given the drop in systolic blood pressure to the 80s and the presence of multiple organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to intubation. She has multifocal pneumonia, and there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia as well.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient has severe global depressed left ventricular systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction of 10-15%, indicating significant cardiac dysfunction.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has an isolated thrombocytopenia"

   59-year-old woman who was found down with altered mental status,
   admitted to [**Hospital1 608**], and transferred here for further evaluation with
   progressively declining status.  Major current issues include
   Shock
          Likely mixed picture
          Treat as if for sepsis (see below)
          Goal-directed hemodynamic therapy as needed
          Get full TFTs including free T4 to exclude myxedema
          Check random and [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim to exclude adrenal insufficiency
          CVP tracing and minimal pulse pressure variation argue
   against tamponade as major etiology
   Thrombocytopenia
          Appreciate hematology
s help
          Hold on heparin
          Etiology unclear at present, but TTP/HUS felt unlikely
   Sepsis/septic shock (possible/probable)
          Potential sources include pneumonia, kidney, viral
          Meningitis or encephalitis is also in DDx
          Follow cultures and consider bronchoscopy for samples
          Continue present antibiotics, follow cultures, and formally
   consult infectious disease.
          HIV testing (ask for assent of HCP and consult ethics, since
   patient unable to consent)
          Await ID
s consultation: differential here seems very broad.
   Renal failure (acute vs. chronic)
          [**Month (only) 51**] need to consider relieving hydroureter; in particular,
   this may be a site of infection
          Consult urology for recommendations
   Pericardial effusion
          Etiology uncertain
          Seems unlikely to have tamponade physiology at present
   Congestive heart failure, systolic, severe (unclear if acute or
   chronic)
          Etiology uncertain
          Cardiology consultation today
   Transaminitis and
fatty liver
 by CT
          Follow clinically
   A unifying diagnosis is not immediately apparent.  Will ask ID for
   thoughts (e.g. transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, etc. could raise the
   possibility of babesiosis though unusual seasonal timing and doesn
   seem to fit complete picture).  Viral and other unusual infections are
   also in DDx.  Will also discuss role of LP with ID team, since
   higher-than-usual risk given thrombocytopenia, known spine disease,
   etc.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 59-year-old woman who was found down with altered mental status and admitted to the hospital. She has been transferred to the ICU for further evaluation. The patient's current issues include shock (likely mixed picture), thrombocytopenia, sepsis/septic shock (possible/probable), renal failure (acute vs. chronic), pericardial effusion, congestive heart failure (systolic, severe), transaminitis, and fatty liver by CT.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Complications related to shock:
- Organ dysfunction due to inadequate blood flow and oxygen supply.
- Multiorgan failure.
- Increased risk of infections.

2. Complications related to thrombocytopenia:
- Bleeding disorders, such as spontaneous bleeding or hemorrhage.
- Increased risk of infection due to impaired immune response.

3. Complications related to sepsis/septic shock:
- Organ dysfunction, including respiratory, renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular systems.
- Severe infection at potential sources, such as pneumonia, kidney infection, or meningitis.
- Increased risk of multiple organ failure.

4. Complications related to renal failure:
- Build-up of waste products and toxins in the body.
- Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
- Increased risk of infection.

5. Complications related to pericardial effusion:
- Cardiac tamponade, which can lead to decreased cardiac output"

   Total time spent:
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old woman who was found down with altered mental status and admitted to the hospital. She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation due to her progressively declining status. The major current issues include shock, thrombocytopenia, sepsis/septic shock (possible/probable), renal failure (acute vs. chronic), pericardial effusion, congestive heart failure (systolic, severe), transaminitis, and fatty liver.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. This could be due to pneumonia or other respiratory conditions.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can lead to bleeding complications.

3. Sepsis/Sepsi Shock: The patient is suspected to have sepsis or septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not treated promptly. This may require dialysis.

5. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a small pericardial effusion, which could potentially lead to cardiac tamponade if it increases in size.

6. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has severe systolic congest"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Sepsis/septic shock: The patient has been diagnosed with possible/probable sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. It can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is experiencing low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding. This condition needs to be monitored closely, especially during procedures or if there is any trauma.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by abnormal blood tests and the need for consultation with a urologist. Acute or chronic kidney injury can occur due to various reasons such as infection, dehydration, or medication toxicity.

4. Congestive heart failure, systolic, severe: The patient has severe heart failure, which means their heart's ability to pump blood efficiently is impaired. This condition can worsen if left untreated and may lead to further complications like cardiogenic shock.

5. Pericardial effusion: The presence of fluid around the heart can indicate an underlying medical condition, such as infection or inflammation. It may require further investigation and intervention to prevent cardiac tamponade.

6. Transaminitis and fatty liver: These findings suggest liver involvement and dysfunction. Monitoring liver enzymes and assessing for any signs of liver failure is crucial.

   59F with a h/o tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status with
   thrombocytopenia, now with respiratory failure.
   # Shock:  Likely septic given high mixed venous O2 sat.  On Levophed.
   Source unclear but has constellation of sxs that could be secondary to
   underlying infectious syndrome.  Most likely sites of infection include
   pneumonia (given multifocal consolidations on chest x-ray), carditis
   (given pericardial effusion), meningitis (given acute mental status
   change), upper or lower urinary tract infection (given purulent fluid
   on drainage in left nephrostomy tube), or bacteremia.
   -continue levophed w/ MAP goal > 65 and wean levophed as tolerated
   -Currently on vancomycin and meropenem and levoquin for coverage of PNA
   (day 4 of vanc, day 1 of meropenem)
   -For possibility of meningitis: on Vanc + [**Last Name (un) 614**] + acyclovir
   -For possibiliity of influenza: on oseltamavir, however DFAs negative;
   touch base w/ ID re: d/c oseltamavir.
   -F/u urine cultures from nephrostomy tube, follow up multiple cxs
   (babesia, ehrilichia, lyme: possibility given LFT elevations,
   thrombocytopenia)
   -Need to obtain HIV consent today from proxy
   -F/u ID recs (including results from multiple cultures and serologies
   that were sent out)
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Worsening respiratory status and hypoxia and
   intubated.  Cause of respiratory failure is likely multifactorial
   including evidence for multifocal PNA on CT, volume overload in setting
   of low EF, likely ARDS given acuity of distress and development of
   bilateral infiltrates.
   -On ARDS low ventilation protocol
   -FiO2 currently 60%, PEEP has been weaned down to 12
   -Was hypercarbic and have increased respiratory rate to 35 to resolve
   respiratory acidosis; has improved from 50 to 37; would try to reduce
   minute ventilation given steady improvement in CO2.
   -Continue to decrease FiO2 for goal FiO2 of 50% and goal PEEP of 10
   today.
   -Continue tx of pneumonia
   -If possible, can try bronch today to obtain BAL
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy:  Ejection fraction is 10% and LV and RV are both
   moderately dilated, suggestive of a dilated cardiomyopathy.  Possible
   causes of dilated cardiomyopathy include infectious causes (HIV,
   [**Location (un) **]) versus alcohol abuse versus autoimmune syndromes (lupus vs
   celiac disease), versus nutritional deficiences (thiamine, selenium,
   L-carnitine) versus hypothyroidism. Ischemia can also cause dilated
   cardiomyopathy.
   -Pt has possible prior hx of hypothyroidism per husband but has not
   visited doctor in 5 years so may have had untx hypothyroidism; TSH is
   25 and free T3, T4 low.   Started thyroid replacement yesterday;
   continue thyroid replacement daily, touch base w/ endocrine.
   -obtain HIV test today
   -F/u thiamine levels
   .
   #Pericardial Effusion: Most likely causes is acute infectious process
   versus thyroid disease. On echo, does not seem to be causing any
   tamponade physiology.
   -Treat underlying thyroid disease as above
   -F/u cultures
   -F/u cardiology consult
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Subacute process with acute decline.
   Differential includes endocrinopathy related mental status changes
   (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), infection
   (meningitis/encephalitis), versus toxic ingestion.  TTP under
   consideration given thrombocytopenia but less likely given absence of
   schistocytes.  Acute vascular disease seems less likely given CT head
   negative.
   -Continue thyroid replacement
   -R/o for adrenal insufficiency given AM cortisol > 20 and positive
   response to c-stim test
   -Continue empiric tx for meningoencephalitis w/ abx regimen per above
   -F/u CSF cultures and serologies
   -Hem-onc thinks TTP unlikely given absense of schistocytes
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt has an isolated thrombocytopenia.  Most likely
   causes are ITP in setting of viral infection.  Possibly related to
   toxin ingestion.  TTP/DIC unlikely.   Following platelet transfusion,
   rose to 110, but over 24 hrs have decreased to 40 over 24 hrs.  More
   suggestive of destruction rather than underproduction given acuity of
   drop and without depression of other cell lines.
   -Platelets [**Hospital1 7**]
   -Transfuse if < 10 or if active signs of bleeding
   - F/u serologies
   -F/u hem/onc recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Likely has an intermediate syndrome between
   pre-renal and ATN:  has granular casts on sediment however FeNA is .12%
   and Urine sodium is low.  Continues to be oliguric.
   -Cautious fluid boluses 500 ccs now:  follow UOP w/ goal of 35-50 ccs
   - Renally dose meds, follow  daily creatinines
   .
   #. Anemia: - hct 48->34->30, stable, no overt evidence of bleed.  Drop
   likely secondary to fluids (and d/c in Hct?)
   -Check HCT this afternoon
   -transfuse if HCT falls < 25
   -maintain active type and screen
   .
   #. Hydronephrosis: Found incidentally on renal ultrasound, moderate on
   the left.  Has a history of nephrolithiasis. Now with obstructing stone
   on L 6x5mm.  Nephrostomy tube placed and pustulant fluid drained.
   -F/u cultures from fluid
   -CT did not show any local abscess
   .
   #. Acidosis:  Has respiratory acidosis on top of metabolic acidosis.
   Metabolic acidosis is non-gap and most likely secondary to renal
   failure.
   -For respiratory acidosis, keep resp rate elevated to remove CO2
   -Attempt continued fluid boluses for renal failure
   .
   #. Substance abuse: SW c/s, psych to see when extubated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status who is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient is likely septic given the high mixed venous O2 saturation and is on levophed. The source of infection is unclear, but potential sites include pneumonia, carditis, meningitis, upper or lower urinary tract infection, or bacteremia.

The patient is currently on vancomycin and meropenem for pneumonia coverage, as well as levofloxacin. She is also on oseltamavir for influenza, although DFA tests were negative. It is recommended to touch base with ID regarding discontinuing oseltamavir.

Urine cultures from the nephrostomy tube and follow-up multiple CSFs (including babesia, ehrlichia, lyme) should be obtained due to the possibility of these infections given LFT elevations and thrombocytopenia.

HIV consent from the proxy needs to be obtained today, and ID recommendations should be followed up with the results from multiple cultures and serologies that were sent out.

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure with worsening respiratory status and hypoxia, leading to intubation. The cause of respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CT, volume overload in the setting of low EF, and likely ARDS given the acuity of distress and development of bilateral infiltrates.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   59F with a h/o tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status with
   thrombocytopenia, now with respiratory failure.
   # Shock:  Likely septic given high mixed venous O2 sat.  On Levophed.
   Source unclear but has constellation of sxs that could be secondary to
   underlying infectious syndrome.  Most likely sites of infection include
   pneumonia (given multifocal consolidations on chest x-ray), carditis
   (given pericardial effusion), meningitis (given acute mental status
   change), upper or lower urinary tract infection (given purulent fluid
   on drainage in left nephrostomy tube), or bacteremia.
   -continue levophed w/ MAP goal > 65 and wean levophed as tolerated
   -Currently on vancomycin and meropenem and levoquin for coverage of PNA
   (day 4 of vanc, day 1 of meropenem)
   -For possibility of meningitis: on Vanc + [**Last Name (un) 614**] + acyclovir
   -For possibiliity of influenza: on oseltamavir, however DFAs negative;
   touch base w/ ID re: d/c oseltamavir.
   -F/u urine cultures from nephrostomy tube, follow up multiple cxs
   (babesia, ehrilichia, lyme: possibility given LFT elevations,
   thrombocytopenia)
   -Need to obtain HIV consent today from proxy
   -F/u ID recs (including results from multiple cultures and serologies
   that were sent out)
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Worsening respiratory status and hypoxia and
   intubated.  Cause of respiratory failure is likely multifactorial
   including evidence for multifocal PNA on CT, volume overload in setting
   of low EF, likely ARDS given acuity of distress and development of
   bilateral infiltrates.
   -On ARDS low ventilation protocol
   -FiO2 currently 60%, PEEP has been weaned down to 12
   -Was hypercarbic and have increased respiratory rate to 35 to resolve
   respiratory acidosis; has improved from 50 to 37; would try to reduce
   minute ventilation given steady improvement in CO2.
   -Continue to decrease FiO2 for goal FiO2 of 50% and goal PEEP of 10
   today.
   -Continue tx of pneumonia
   -If possible, can try bronch today to obtain BAL
   .
   # Cardiomyopathy:  Ejection fraction is 10% and LV and RV are both
   moderately dilated, suggestive of a dilated cardiomyopathy.  Possible
   causes of dilated cardiomyopathy include infectious causes (HIV,
   [**Location (un) **]) versus alcohol abuse versus autoimmune syndromes (lupus vs
   celiac disease), versus nutritional deficiences (thiamine, selenium,
   L-carnitine) versus hypothyroidism. Ischemia can also cause dilated
   cardiomyopathy.
   -Pt has possible prior hx of hypothyroidism per husband but has not
   visited doctor in 5 years so may have had untx hypothyroidism; TSH is
   25 and free T3, T4 low.   Started thyroid replacement yesterday;
   continue thyroid replacement daily, touch base w/ endocrine.
   -obtain HIV test today
   -send out TTG Ab to test for celiac
   -F/u thiamine, obtain selenium and L-carnitine levels
   .
   #Pericardial Effusion: Most likely causes is acute infectious process
   versus thyroid disease. On echo, does not seem to be causing any
   tamponade physiology.
   -Treat underlying thyroid disease as above
   -F/u cultures
   -F/u cardiology consult
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Subacute process with acute decline.
   Differential includes endocrinopathy related mental status changes
   (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), infection
   (meningitis/encephalitis), versus toxic ingestion.  TTP under
   consideration given thrombocytopenia but less likely given absence of
   schistocytes.  Acute vascular disease seems less likely given CT head
   negative.
   -Continue thyroid replacement
   -R/o for adrenal insufficiency given AM cortisol > 20 and positive
   response to c-stim test
   -Continue empiric tx for meningoencephalitis w/ abx regimen per above
   -F/u CSF cultures and serologies
   -Hem-onc thinks TTP unlikely given absense of schistocytes
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt has an isolated thrombocytopenia.  Most likely
   causes are ITP in setting of viral infection.  Possibly related to
   toxin ingestion.  TTP/DIC unlikely.   Following platelet transfusion,
   rose to 110, but over 24 hrs have decreased to 40 over 24 hrs.  More
   suggestive of destruction rather than underproduction given acuity of
   drop and without depression of other cell lines.
   -Platelets [**Hospital1 7**]
   -Transfuse if < 10 or if active signs of bleeding
   - F/u serologies
   -F/u hem/onc recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Likely has an intermediate syndrome between
   pre-renal and ATN:  has granular casts on sediment however FeNA is .12%
   and Urine sodium is low.  Continues to be oliguric.
   -Cautious fluid boluses 500 ccs now:  follow UOP w/ goal of 35-50 ccs
   - Renally dose meds, follow  daily creatinines
   .
   #. Anemia: - hct 48->34->30, stable, no overt evidence of bleed.  Drop
   likely secondary to fluids (and d/c in Hct?)
   -Check HCT this afternoon
   -transfuse if HCT falls < 25
   -maintain active type and screen
   .
   #. Hydronephrosis: Found incidentally on renal ultrasound, moderate on
   the left.  Has a history of nephrolithiasis. Now with obstructing stone
   on L 6x5mm.  Nephrostomy tube placed and pustulant fluid drained.
   -F/u cultures from fluid
   -CT did not show any local abscess
   .
   #. Acidosis:  Has respiratory acidosis on top of metabolic acidosis.
   Metabolic acidosis is non-gap and most likely secondary to renal
   failure.
   -For respiratory acidosis, keep resp rate elevated to remove CO2
   -Attempt continued fluid boluses for renal failure
   .
   #. Substance abuse: SW c/s, psych to see when extubated
   .
   #. Depression: Holding fluoxetine for now.  Psych c/s as above.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status, who is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, given the high mixed venous O2 saturation and the need for vasopressor support (Levophed). The source of infection is unclear but could be secondary to an underlying infectious syndrome, including pneumonia, carditis, meningitis, urinary tract infection, or bacteremia.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, leading to intubation. The cause of respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CT, volume overload due to low ejection fraction, and the development of bilateral infiltrates suggestive of ARDS.

3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a significantly decreased ejection fraction (10%) with moderate dilation of the left and right ventricles, indicative of dilated cardiomyopathy. Possible causes include infectious agents like HIV or alcohol abuse versus autoimmune syndromes (lupus, celiac disease), nutritional deficiencies (thiamine, selenium, L-carnitine), hypothyroidism, or ischemia.

4. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a moderate pericardial effusion, which could be due to an acute infectious process or thyroid disease"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a chief complaint of being found down with altered mental status and presumed tramadol overdose. The patient is currently in the ICU due to several medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is presumed to have septic shock, possibly due to multiple potential sources including lung and kidney infections. Empirical coverage with vancomycin is being given.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDSnet ventilation has been started, which has shown improvement overnight. The plan is to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.

3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient is diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, but no specific etiology has been identified yet.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suffering from acute renal failure, possibly due to hydronephrosis. A nephrostomy tube has been placed, and the drainage is tapering off. There is a concern about occlusion with debris, and interventional radiology (IR) consultation is recommended.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is experiencing thrombocytopenia, with an unclear etiology. Heme follow-up has been scheduled.

6. Pericardial Effusion: The patient has pericardial effusion, but no evidence of tam"

   multifactorial including evidence for multifocal PNA on CT, volume
   overload in setting of low EF, ARDS determined to be unlikey given she
   is oxygenating well.
   - off ARDS protocol ventilation, but give consideration to avoid high

   - Continue tx of pneumonia
   - If possible, can try bronch today to obtain BAL
   # Cardiomyopathy:  Ejection fraction is 10% and LV and RV are both
   moderately dilated, suggestive of a dilated cardiomyopathy.  Possible
   causes of dilated cardiomyopathy include infectious causes (HIV,
   [**Location (un) **]) versus alcohol abuse versus autoimmune syndromes (lupus vs
   celiac disease), versus nutritional deficiences (thiamine, selenium,
   L-carnitine) versus hypothyroidism. Ischemia unlikely given age and
   lack of cardiac hx.
   - Degree of her hypothyroidism is not significant enough to cause this

   - obtain HIV test today
   - F/u thiamine levels

   negative.
   -Continue thyroid replacement
   -Continue empiric tx for meningoencephalitis w/ abx regimen per above
   -F/u CSF cultures and serologies
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt has an isolated thrombocytopenia.  Most likely
   causes are ITP in setting of viral infection.  Possibly related to
   toxin ingestion.  TTP/DIC unlikely.   Thryombocytopenia more
   suggestive of destruction rather than underproduction given acuity of
   drop and without depression of other cell lines.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of tramadol abuse, who presented to the hospital with septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction. She has acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, fever, and hypothyroidism. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be secondary to an underlying infectious syndrome. Possible sites of infection include upper urinary tract infection (UTI) given the positive culture for gram-negative rods (GNR), bacterial or viral pneumonia, carditis, and meningitis. 

The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics for GNR, including meropenem and levoquin, as well as vancomycin for possible pneumonia. She is also on acyclovir for the possibility of viral meningitis and oseltamavir for influenza. 

Further investigations include obtaining HIV consent, following up with urine cultures from the nephrostomy tube, and reviewing multiple CXRs. The patient's cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, and anemia need further evaluation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 95/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is intubated and sedated, with distant heart sounds and unresponsiveness to st"

   [**Location (un) **]) versus alcohol abuse versus autoimmune syndromes (lupus vs
   celiac disease), versus nutritional deficiences (thiamine, selenium,
   L-carnitine) versus hypothyroidism. Ischemia unlikely given age and
   lack of cardiac hx.
   - Degree of her hypothyroidism is not significant enough to cause this
   level myopathy.  Pt started thyroid replacement per endo recs.
   - obtain HIV test today
   - F/u thiamine levels
   - cath is indicated
   #Pericardial Effusion: Most likely causes is acute infectious process
   versus thyroid disease. On echo, does not seem to be causing any
   tamponade physiology.
   -Treat underlying thyroid disease as above
   -F/u cultures
   -F/u cardiology consult .
   - f/u CVP
   # Altered Mental Status: Subacute process with acute decline.  Most
   likely [**12-31**] to infection (meningitis/encephalitis) versus toxic
   ingestion.   Acute vascular disease seems less likely given CT head
   negative.
   -Continue thyroid replacement
   -Continue empiric tx for meningoencephalitis w/ abx regimen per above
   -F/u CSF cultures and serologies
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt has an isolated thrombocytopenia.  Most likely
   causes are ITP in setting of viral infection.  Possibly related to
   toxin ingestion.  TTP/DIC unlikely.   Thryombocytopenia more
   suggestive of destruction rather than underproduction given acuity of
   drop and without depression of other cell lines.
   - Platelets [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Transfuse if < 10 or if active signs of bleeding
   - F/u serologies
   - F/u hem/onc recs
   #. Acute renal failure:  Likely has an intermediate syndrome between
   pre-renal and ATN:  has granular casts on sediment however FeNA is .12%
   and Urine sodium is low.  Continues to be oliguric.
   - Cautious fluid boluses
   - Renally dose meds, follow  daily creatinines
   #. Anemia: - hct 48->34->30 ->31, stable, no overt evidence of bleed.
   Drop likely secondary to fluids and or beginning of drop in all cell
   lines (although WBC still 26)
   -Check HCT this afternoon
   -transfuse if HCT falls < 25
   -maintain active type and screen
   #. Hydronephrosis: Found incidentally on renal ultrasound, moderate on
   the left.  Has a history of nephrolithiasis. Now with obstructing stone
   on L 6x5mm.  Nephrostomy tube placed and pustulant fluid drained
   growing GNR.
   -F/u cultures from fluid
   -CT did not show any local abscess
   #Hypothyroidism - continue levothroxine, endo following

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status, who is now presenting with respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has a high fever, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status, suggesting a systemic infectious process.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including evidence of multifocal pneumonia on chest x-ray and volume overload in the setting of low ejection fraction. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is oxygenating well.

The patient's cardiomyopathy is characterized by a severely reduced ejection fraction of 10% and moderately dilated left and right ventricles. The possible causes of dilated cardiomyopathy include infectious causes (such as HIV or GNR), alcohol abuse, autoimmune syndromes (like lupus or celiac disease), nutritional deficiencies (such as thiamine, selenium, or L-carnitine), or hypothyroidism. The patient has started thyroid replacement therapy.

The patient also has a pericardial effusion, most likely due to an acute infectious process or thyroid disease. The effusion does not seem to be causing tamponade physiology.

Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia, likely caused by immune thrombocytopenia in the setting of viral infection or possibly related to toxin ingestion. The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to an intermediate syndrome between pre-renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   59F found down with altered mental status, tramadol overdose
   Sepsis/Shock
   - presumed septic etiology
 multiple potential sources including lung,
   kidney.
           -Bact meningitis less likely given LP results
   - covering empirically with vanc, [**Last Name (un) 614**], levo for PNA
   - ACV empirically for HSV
   -Tamiflu empirically for influenza
   -considering FOB/BAL for sampling
 however dev worsening hypotension
   during rounds.  Also on 12 of PEEP and required recruitment maneuver
   Friday so some concern about potential for derecruitment during FOB.
   Her Pplat of 26 and Compliance of ~30 mitigate this concern to a
   certain degree.  However, because of her hemodynamic instability, we
   are opting to wait on FOB/BAL and have team reconsider tomorrow.
   Resp failure
   -oxygenation relatively stable
   -Lungs reasonably compliant (~30)
   -Still requiring moderate PEEP
   Cardiomyopathy
   -newly dx dilated CM
   -EF 10%
   -? suppressed contractility related to sepsis though dilated nature
   concerning that might be unrelated process.
   -cardiology consulted
   Pericardial effusion
   -no evidence of tamponade physiology at present.
   -etiology unclear
   Acute Renal Failure
   -creatinine up 2.7->3.1
   -check urine lytes, examine sediment
   -poor forward flow vs. ATN
   -renal consult
   Hydronephrosis
   -s/p nephrostomy tube
   -draining clear urine
   Thrombocytopenia
   -Etiology remains unclear
   - heme following
   Substance abuse
   -Tramadol, benzos

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who was found down with altered mental status due to tramadol overdose. She is currently critically ill and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions. These include sepsis/shock with multiple potential sources such as lung and kidney infections, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation with moderate PEEP, cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction of 10%, pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology, acute renal failure with increasing creatinine levels, hydronephrosis treated with a nephrostomy tube, thrombocytopenia with unclear etiology, and substance abuse involving tramadol and benzodiazepines.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachypnea, indicating poor hemodynamic stability. Her blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.34. The laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies are pending.

The patient's management plan includes ongoing fluid resuscitation, antibiotic therapy for presumed sepsis, and supportive care for respiratory failure. Cardiology consultation has been sought due to newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy. Renal consult is also planned to evaluate acute renal failure. The etiology of thrombocytopenia remains unclear.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently admitted to the ICU for critical care management. Further assessments and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with several medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Altered mental status: The patient was found down with altered mental status, presumed to be due to tramadol overdose.

2. Sepsis/Shock: The patient is suspected to have sepsis or shock, possibly with multiple potential sources including lung and kidney infections. Empirical antibiotics coverage has been initiated.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, but there was improvement overnight. The plan is to wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. Cardiology consultation has been obtained.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 2.7 to 3.1, indicating acute renal failure. Further evaluation of urine electrolytes and sediment is needed, and a renal consult has been requested.

6. Hydronephrosis: The patient underwent placement of a nephrostomy tube due to hydronephrosis, and the drainage is clear.

7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia with an unclear etiology. Heme follow-up has been ordered.

8. Substance abuse: The patient has a history of substance abuse involving tram"

   Assessment and Plan
   59F with a h/o tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status with
   thrombocytopenia, now with respiratory failure and pyelonephritis from
   obstructed stone as well as cardimyopathy and decreased EF with
   pericardial effusion.
   # Shock:  Likely septic vs cardiogenic.  On dobutamine/levo and
   maintained MAPs.  High mixed venous O2 sat.  Source unclear but has
   constellation of sxs that could be secondary to underlying infectious
   syndrome.  Most likely sites is urine given obstructive stone and
   purulent drainage from L nephrostomy tube with GNR.  She presented to
   [**Hospital1 19**] with GNR suggesting she might have been paritally treated and
   therefore not present with postive bacteremia.   This may be
   complicated by bacterial or viral  pneumonia (given multifocal
   consolidations on chest x-ray), carditis (given pericardial effusion),
   meningitis (given acute mental status change).  Abx: day 6 of
   vanc/levo, day 4 of meropenem, acylovir, tamiflu
   - continue goal MAP > 65 to be obtained with dobutamine and levophed
   - For UTI: [**Last Name (un) 614**]/levo
   - For PNA: Currently on vancomycin and meropenem and levoquin for
   coverage of PNA
   - For possibility of meningitis: on Vanc + [**Last Name (un) 614**] + acyclovir
   - For possibiliity of influenza: on oseltamavir, ID does not want to
   r/o influenza until negative BAL
   - F/u urine cultures from nephrostomy tube, follow up multiple cxs
   - F/u HIV
   - call [**Hospital1 10990**] regarding blood culture data/growth, Urine
   culture growth.
   - F/u ID recs (including results from multiple cultures and serologies
   that were sent out)
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure is likely
   multifactorial including evidence for multifocal PNA vs acute lung
   injury on CT, volume overload in setting of low EF.  Sputum negative.
   Has had hypoxia with high PEEP requirement which is concerning for
   acute lung injury.  PEEP 15 with PIP 30
   - Continue tx of pneumonia
   - Mini BAL or influenza DFA per ID
   # Cardiomyopathy:  Ejection fraction is 10% and LV and RV are both
   moderately dilated, suggestive of a dilated cardiomyopathy.  Likely
   cause is from sepsis.  Also consider dilated cardiomyopathy include
   infectious causes (HIV, [**Location (un) **]) versus alcohol abuse versus
   autoimmune syndromes (lupus vs celiac disease), versus nutritional
   deficiences (thiamine, selenium, L-carnitine). Ischemia unlikely given
   age and lack of cardiac hx.    Degree of her hypothyroidism is not
   significant enough to cause this level myopathy.  Pt started thyroid
   replacement per endo recs.
   - F/u thiamine levels
   - touch base with cards re: further workup , i.e. ischemic workup
   - repeat ECHO when improved
   - increase PEEP and monitor for improvement of BP
   #Pericardial Effusion: Most likely causes is acute infectious process
   versus thyroid disease. On echo, does not seem to be causing any
   tamponade physiology.
   -Treat underlying thyroid disease as above
   -F/u cultures
   -F/u cardiology consult
   - f/u CVP
   # Altered Mental Status: Subacute process with acute decline.  Most
   likely [**12-31**] to sepsis versus toxic ingestion.   Acute vascular disease
   seems less likely given CT head negative.
   - Cont sepsis
   - Continue thyroid replacement
   - Continue empiric tx for meningoencephalitis w/ abx regimen per above
   - F/u CSF cultures and serologies
   #. Acute renal failure:  Likely has an intermediate syndrome between
   pre-renal and ATN:  has granular casts on sediment however FeNA is .12%
   and Urine sodium is low.  Continues to be oliguric.
   - Cautious fluid boluses
   - Renally dose meds, follow  daily creatinines
   - c/s renal to spin urine, offer opinion on when dialysis should be
   considered
   - start lasix gtt for improved urine output and goal net negative
   #. Anemia: - hct 48->34->30 ->31, stable, no overt evidence of bleed.
   Drop likely secondary to fluids and or beginning of drop in all cell
   lines (although WBC still 26)
   -Check HCT this afternoon
   -transfuse if HCT falls < 21
   - hemolysis labs
   -maintain active type and screen
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt has an isolated thrombocytopenia.  Most likely
   causes are ITP in setting of viral infection.  Possibly related to
   toxin ingestion.  TTP/DIC unlikely.   Thryombocytopenia more
   suggestive of destruction rather than underproduction given acuity of
   drop and without depression of other cell lines.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of tramadol abuse, presenting with subacute altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, and pyelonephritis secondary to an obstructed stone. She also has cardiomyopathy with a decreased ejection fraction and pericardial effusion. The patient is in shock, likely due to sepsis or cardiogenic causes, and is being treated with dobutamine/levo and maintained mean arterial pressure (MAPs). She has a constellation of symptoms suggesting an underlying infectious syndrome, with the most likely source being the urine due to an obstructed stone and purulent drainage from the left nephrostomy tube with gram-negative rods (GNR). 

The patient has been on antibiotics since day 6, including vancomycin and levofoxacin for urinary tract infection (UTI), meropenem for pneumonia (PNA), and acyclovir for meningitis. She is also on oseltamivir for influenza. 

The patient's respiratory failure may be multifactorial, including evidence of multifocal PNA versus acute lung injury on CT, and volume overload in the setting of low ejection fraction. 

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is being treated with levothyroxine. 

There are multiple other medical issues, including altered mental status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and substance abuse"

   Assessment and Plan
   59F with a h/o tramadol abuse and subacute altered mental status with
   thrombocytopenia, now with respiratory failure and pyelonephritis from
   obstructed stone as well as cardimyopathy and decreased EF with
   pericardial effusion.
   # Shock:  Likely septic vs cardiogenic.  On dobutamine/levo and
   maintained MAPs.  High mixed venous O2 sat.  Source unclear but has
   constellation of sxs that could be secondary to underlying infectious
   syndrome.  Most likely sites is urine given obstructive stone and
   purulent drainage from L nephrostomy tube with GNR.  She presented to
   [**Hospital1 19**] with GNR suggesting she might have been paritally treated and
   therefore not present with postive bacteremia.   This may be
   complicated by bacterial or viral  pneumonia (given multifocal
   consolidations on chest x-ray), carditis (given pericardial effusion),
   meningitis (given acute mental status change).  Abx: day 6 of
   vanc/levo, day 4 of meropenem, acylovir, tamiflu
   - continue goal MAP > 65 to be obtained with dobutamine and levophed
   - For UTI: [**Last Name (un) 614**]/levo
   - For PNA: Currently on vancomycin and meropenem and levoquin for
   coverage of PNA
   - For possibility of meningitis: on Vanc + [**Last Name (un) 614**] + acyclovir
   - For possibiliity of influenza: on oseltamavir, ID does not want to
   r/o influenza until negative BAL
   - F/u urine cultures from nephrostomy tube, follow up multiple cxs
   - F/u HIV
   - call [**Hospital1 10990**] regarding blood culture data/growth, Urine
   culture growth.
   - F/u ID recs (including results from multiple cultures and serologies
   that were sent out)
   # Respiratory failure:  Cause of respiratory failure is likely
   multifactorial including evidence for multifocal PNA vs acute lung
   injury on CT, volume overload in setting of low EF.  Sputum negative.
   Has had hypoxia with high PEEP requirement which is concerning for
   acute lung injury.  PEEP 15 with PIP 30
   - wean as tolerated
   - Continue tx of pneumonia
   - If possible, can try bronch today to obtain BAL
   # Cardiomyopathy:  Ejection fraction is 10% and LV and RV are both
   moderately dilated, suggestive of a dilated cardiomyopathy.  Likely
   cause is from sepsis.  Also consider dilated cardiomyopathy include
   infectious causes (HIV, [**Location (un) **]) versus alcohol abuse versus
   autoimmune syndromes (lupus vs celiac disease), versus nutritional
   deficiences (thiamine, selenium, L-carnitine). Ischemia unlikely given
   age and lack of cardiac hx.    Degree of her hypothyroidism is not
   significant enough to cause this level myopathy.  Pt started thyroid
   replacement per endo recs.
   - F/u thiamine levels
   - touch base with cards re: further workup , i.e. ischemic workup
   - repeat ECHO when improved
   #Pericardial Effusion: Most likely causes is acute infectious process
   versus thyroid disease. On echo, does not seem to be causing any
   tamponade physiology.
   -Treat underlying thyroid disease as above
   -F/u cultures
   -F/u cardiology consult
   - f/u CVP
   # Altered Mental Status: Subacute process with acute decline.  Most
   likely [**12-31**] to sepsis versus toxic ingestion.   Acute vascular disease
   seems less likely given CT head negative.
   - Cont sepsis
   - Continue thyroid replacement
   - Continue empiric tx for meningoencephalitis w/ abx regimen per above
   - F/u CSF cultures and serologies
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  Pt has an isolated thrombocytopenia.  Most likely
   causes are ITP in setting of viral infection.  Possibly related to
   toxin ingestion.  TTP/DIC unlikely.   Thryombocytopenia more
   suggestive of destruction rather than underproduction given acuity of
   drop and without depression of other cell lines.
   - Platelets [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Transfuse if < 10 or if active signs of bleeding
   - F/u serologies
   - F/u hem/onc recs
   #. Acute renal failure:  Likely has an intermediate syndrome between
   pre-renal and ATN:  has granular casts on sediment however FeNA is .12%
   and Urine sodium is low.  Continues to be oliguric.
   - Cautious fluid boluses
   - Renally dose meds, follow  daily creatinines
   - c/s renal to spin urine, offer opinion on when dialysis should be
   considered
   #. Anemia: - hct 48->34->30 ->31, stable, no overt evidence of bleed.
   Drop likely secondary to fluids and or beginning of drop in all cell
   lines (although WBC still 26)
   -Check HCT this afternoon
   -transfuse if HCT falls < 25
   -maintain active type and screen
   #. Hydronephrosis: Found incidentally on renal ultrasound, moderate on
   the left.  Has a history of nephrolithiasis. Now with obstructing stone
   on L 6x5mm.  Nephrostomy tube placed and pustulant fluid drained
   growing GNR.
   -F/u cultures from fluid
   -CT did not show any local abscess
   #Hypothyroidism - continue levothroxine, endo following
   #. Substance abuse: SW c/s, psych to see when extubated
   #. Depression: Holding fluoxetine for now.  Psych c/s as above.

   Disposition:
","The patient's medical history and current condition indicate a complex and critical situation. The patient has a history of tramadol abuse and presents with subacute altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, pyelonephritis caused by an obstructed stone, cardiomyopathy with decreased ejection fraction, pericardial effusion, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient's current vital signs show tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, low blood pressure (97/51 mmHg), and an oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and the central venous pressure is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and altered liver function tests. Blood cultures are positive for Gram-negative rods, suggesting a possible bacterial infection. Urine culture also grows Gram-negative rods, indicating a urinary tract infection. Other pending tests include HIV, CSF fungal and viral cultures, blood fungal/afb, anti-TPO, hepatitis labs, and CSF West Nile virus.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, meropenem, levofloxacin), antivirals (acyclovir, oseltamivir), and cardiac support (dobutamine, levo). The patient is also receiving nutritional support through tube feeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive.
   1. Fevers--Continues to have fevers and WBC count still elevated. BCx's
   continue to be negative. Has positive yeast Cx from sputum but this
   likely commensural flora. Only possible sources are bibasilar opacities
   and LUL opacity that appears to be improved on yesterday's CXR and
   positive urine/fluid Cx from perc nephrostomy tube placement/drainage
   from [**2115-9-20**]. Yesterday, all ABx were pulled off except Levofloxacin
   to treat PNA, which would presumably cover GNR Klebsiella in urine as
   well.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Levaquin today is day [**4-11**]
   --Will hold off on doing bronchoscopy for now as they won
t increase
   the yield of causative [**Doctor Last Name **].
   --Per Pharmacy, would need to switch to Cipro due to this hospital
   antibiograms
 d/c Levo and start Cipro
   --Call Radiology to get better sense of how CXR
s have changed over
   time and whether LUL/bibasilar opacities appear improved
   --Need to call [**Hospital1 608**] OSH to f/u Cx
s that were drawn there, just
   before pt got 3d of Levofloxacin and transfer to [**Hospital1 19**]
   --Brief summary of infectious workup:
     --> BCx from [**2115-9-22**] pending (myco/lytic), and negative to date BCx
   x6 from [**2115-9-18**] to [**2115-9-23**]
     --> Sputum Cx's [**2115-9-21**] showing yeast, negative [**2115-9-19**]
     --> UCx negative x2, but positive x2 with pansensitive Klebsiella on
   [**2115-9-20**]
     --> UCx Legionella negative
     --> Lyme serology pending
     --> Many serologies still pending: Adenovirus PCR, Ehrlichia,
   Babesia, [**Location (un) 2636**], Leptospira, LCM, Parvovirus B19
     --> CRP 126.6, ESR 100 --> 92
     --> Mini-BAL showing 81% PMN's, 3% lymphs, 1% atypical lymphos,
   macros 15% --> negative for PCP --> DFA for Flu was insufficient sample
   2. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
Could this be a Hashimoto
   encephalopathy? Myxedema coma less likely given no hypoTN or
   hypothermia. Could this have been a subclinical hypothyroidism that
   progressively worsened, now with acute insult superimposed and lack of
   appropriate thyroid response?
   --Need to f/u with Endocrinology
 specifically would ask them to weigh
   in on how this hypothyroidism is affected her heart and contributing to
   EF 10-15%, and what they think about this constellation of problems,
   i.e. how they put this puzzling clinical picture together
   --Continue with Levothyroxine 25mcg IV daily
   --Will need to repeat fT4/TSH to see if achieving therapeutic levels

 TSH 25 --> 19

 T4 <1.0 (4.6-12)

 fT4 0.10 (.93-1.7)

 T3 <20

 TBG normal

 Uptake ratio normal

 fT4 direct analysis pending

 anti-TPO  124 (0-35)
   3. Cardiomyopathy--Unclear etiology at present. Continues on pressors,
   recently switched from Neo/Levo to Dobutamine/Levo.
   --Hold off on heart failure regimen for now until hemodynamically
   normalized
s not HTN anyways, but could in long run benefit from
   ACEi and Bblocker
   --Start IV Chlorothiazide
   --F/u viral studies that are pending
   --Consider cardiac MRI to eval for myocarditis, but doubt that this
   would change management
   --Continues on Lasix gtt
   --PA catheter to manage fluid status?

 CE negative x1, BNP elevated 8605 --> [**Numeric Identifier 11024**]

 sepsis induced CMP, myocarditis ([**Location (un) 2636**], viral), pre-existing LV
   dysfxn from EtOH, hypothyroid induced, toxin mediated

 EF 14%, global hypokinesis, effusion but no sign of tamponade
   4. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing  7.34/32/113/18  on CMV 15
   PEEP, 60% FiO2. Pt benefits from increased PEEP.
   --Will hold off on weaning for now as no change in underlying clinical
   problem.
   --Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off
   5. Altered mental status--Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   --Attempt to wean Fentanyl gtt and Versed
 per nursing, pt gets
   agitated when off sedatives, so will not stop completely, just d/c
   continuous and give boluses prn
   --Continue with prophylactic Acyclovir for now until HSV from CSF comes
   back negative, then d/c

   6. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet, going to
   continue to watch. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr and if continues to worsen may need to proceed
   with renal replacement Tx
   7. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly
   --Continue to trend
   --F/u viral serologies
   --Per Heme Onc, transfuse for <10k or if bleeding <50k
   --Will touch base with Heme Onc about their index of suspicion for HIT,
   and if not high, can likely restart subQ Heparin for prophylaxis in bed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of AMS (altered mental status) possibly due to Tramadol overdose, multifocal pneumonia, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been unresponsive since admission. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 100.6°C, heart rate 82 bpm, blood pressure 111/52 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient has a CVP of 11 mmHg and a bladder pressure of 9 mmHg. The total fluid input is 3,430 mL, with an output of 3,950 mL, resulting in a balance of -520 mL. The patient is receiving midazolam, norepinephrine, dobutamine, and fentanyl infusions. 

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 17.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 71 K/uL, creatinine of 3.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 168 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride of 106 mEq/L, calcium of 7.8 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate of 17 mEq/L. The patient also has elevated TPO antibodies and a decreased FT4 level.

The patient has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. The potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation or infection, further decline in renal function, progression of thrombocytopenia, and worsening of hypothyroidism. 

The patient's care plan includes continuing with antibiotics to treat pneumonia, monitoring fluid status and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed, weaning off sedatives while ensuring patient comfort, repeating thyroid function tests, considering cardiac MRI to evaluate for myocarditis, and closely monitoring renal function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status (AMS) from possible Tramadol overdose, multiple pneumonia (PNA's) seen on chest CT, continued fevers, respiratory failure currently on ventilator, percutaneous nephrostomy tube for obstructive stone in left ureter, ejection fraction (EF) of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is unresponsive and has not withdrawn from pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient continues to have fevers and an elevated white blood cell count. Cultures are pending, including sputum and urine from the percutaneous nephrostomy tube.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a recent ABG showing a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 32, PaO2 of 113, and HCO3- of 18. The patient benefits from increased PEEP.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's AMS is likely multifactorial, including toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis versus the effect of hypothyroidism. There are plans to wean the patient off Fentanyl and Versed, and prophylactic Acyclovir will be continued until HSV from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) comes back negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive.
   1. Fevers--Continues to have fevers and WBC count still elevated. BCx's
   continue to be negative. Has positive yeast Cx from sputum but this
   likely commensural flora. Only possible sources are bibasilar opacities
   and LUL opacity that appears to be improved on yesterday's CXR and
   positive urine/fluid Cx from perc nephrostomy tube placement/drainage
   from [**2115-9-20**]. Yesterday, all ABx were pulled off except Levofloxacin
   to treat PNA, which would presumably cover GNR Klebsiella in urine as
   well.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Levaquin today is day [**4-11**]
   --Will hold off on doing bronchoscopy for now as they won
t increase
   the yield of causative [**Doctor Last Name **].
   --Per Pharmacy, would need to switch to Cipro due to this hospital
   antibiograms
 d/c Levo and start Cipro
   --Call Radiology to get better sense of how CXR
s have changed over
   time and whether LUL/bibasilar opacities appear improved
   --Need to call [**Hospital1 608**] OSH to f/u Cx
s that were drawn there, just
   before pt got 3d of Levofloxacin and transfer to [**Hospital1 19**]
   --Brief summary of infectious workup:
     --> BCx from [**2115-9-22**] pending (myco/lytic), and negative to date BCx
   x6 from [**2115-9-18**] to [**2115-9-23**]
     --> Sputum Cx's [**2115-9-21**] showing yeast, negative [**2115-9-19**]
     --> UCx negative x2, but positive x2 with pansensitive Klebsiella on

     --> Lyme serology pending
     --> Many serologies still pending: Adenovirus PCR, Ehrlichia,
   Babesia, [**Location (un) 2636**], Leptospira, LCM, Parvovirus B19
     --> CRP 126.6, ESR 100 --> 92
     --> Mini-BAL showing 81% PMN's, 3% lymphs, 1% atypical lymphos,
   macros 15% --> negative for PCP --> DFA for Flu was insufficient sample
   2. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
Could this be a Hashimoto
   encephalopathy? Myxedema coma less likely given no hypoTN or
   hypothermia. Could this have been a subclinical hypothyroidism that
   progressively worsened, now with acute insult superimposed and lack of
   appropriate thyroid response?
   --Need to f/u with Endocrinology
 specifically would ask them to weigh
   in on how this hypothyroidism is affected her heart and contributing to
   EF 10-15%, and what they think about this constellation of problems,
   i.e. how they put this puzzling clinical picture together
   --Continue with Levothyroxine 25mcg IV daily
   --Will need to repeat fT4/TSH to see if achieving therapeutic levels

 TSH 25 --> 19

 T4 <1.0 (4.6-12)

 fT4 0.10 (.93-1.7)

 T3 <20

   3. Cardiomyopathy--Unclear etiology at present. Continues on pressors,
   recently switched from Neo/Levo to Dobutamine/Levo.
   --Hold off on heart failure regimen for now until hemodynamically
   normalized
s not HTN anyways, but could in long run benefit from
   ACEi and Bblocker
   --Start IV Chlorothiazide
   --F/u viral studies that are pending
   --Consider cardiac MRI to eval for myocarditis, but doubt that this
   would change management
   --Continues on Lasix gtt
   --PA catheter to manage fluid status?

 CE negative x1, BNP elevated 8605 --> [**Numeric Identifier 11024**]

   4. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing  7.34/32/113/18  on CMV 15
   PEEP, 60% FiO2. Pt benefits from increased PEEP.
   --Will hold off on weaning for now as no change in underlying clinical
   problem.
   --Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off
   5. Altered mental status--Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   --Attempt to wean Fentanyl gtt and Versed
 per nursing, pt gets
   agitated when off sedatives, so will not stop completely, just d/c
   continuous and give boluses prn

   continue to watch. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr and if continues to worsen may need to proceed
   with renal replacement Tx
   7. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status due to possible tramadol overdose, multiple pulmonary nodules, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, has a percutaneous nephrostomy tube for an obstructive stone in her left ureter, and has a history of heart failure with an ejection fraction of 14%. The patient's condition remains unstable, and several potential medical complications need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers - The patient continues to have fevers, and her WBC count is still elevated. Blood cultures have been negative, except for positive yeast in sputum, which is likely commensal flora. Other potential sources of infection include bibasilar opacities and left upper lobe opacity seen on chest X-ray. The patient was taken off all antibiotics except Levofloxacin, which covers Gram-negative bacteria including Klebsiella from the urine.

2. Hypothyroidism - The patient has elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, suggesting Hashimoto's encephalopathy. This could be a contributing factor to her altered mental status along with the hypothyroidism.

3. Cardiomyopathy - The etiology of the patient's cardiomyopathy is unclear at present. She is on pressors, recently switched from Norepinephrine/Levophed to"

   progressive fatigue (after a week of work she would sleep from friday
   night to monday morning), bags under her eyes, poor coloring, sore back
   but not clearly DOE, weight gain, cold intolerance, hair loss.  Could
   have had symptomatic hypothyroidism?  She did have sleep apnea, which
   may have contributed to these symptoms.
   - Called [**Hospital1 608**]: no blood cx, stool cx negative, urine cx grew >100,000

 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive.
   1. Cardiomyopathy--Unclear etiology at present.  Ddx is viral
   myocarditis vs hypothyroidism vs shock heart Continues on Dobutamine,
   but norepinephrine has been stopped.  Cardiac function is improving
   with diuresis.  Once he has stabilized, we can consider repeating an
   echocardiogram and beginning heart failure medications (beta blocker)
   if stabilized.
   --Hold off on heart failure regimen for now until hemodynamically
   normalized
s not HTN anyways, but could in long run benefit from
   ACEi and Bblocker
   --Continue lasix and chlorothiazide with goal further 2L negative
   today.  Will continue while pressures are stable.
   --F/u viral studies that are pending
   2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: Unclear why she is having
   decreased gastric emptying.  Ddx includes SBO (less likely given
   abdomen soft), ileus or delayed gastric emptying.  It is worrisome that
   she has not had a bowel movement for a couple of days now.
   - bowel regimen to encourage BM.
   - repeat KUB.
   - can restart TF at lower rate and increase as tolerated.
   3. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO - given her prior history of
   slowing and weight gain, we are again wondering if this could be
   Hashimoto
s encephalopathy? Myxedema coma less likely given no hypoTN
   or hypothermia.  However, it could be a subclinical hypothyroidism that
   progressively worsened, now with acute insult superimposed and lack of
   appropriate thyroid response.
   - endocrinology will come by again today.
   - Continue with Levothyroxine 25mcg IV daily, no utility in repeating
   thyroid function testing for at least 2 weeks.

 fT4 direct analysis pending

 anti-TPO  124 (0-35)
   4. Fevers--Continues to have low grade temps and elevated WBC count,
   though overall fever curve may be improving. All cultures beyond
   initial klebsiella continue to be negative.  Only possible sources are
   bibasilar opacities and LUL opacity that appears to be improved on
   yesterday's CXR and positive urine/fluid Cx from perc nephrostomy tube
   placement/drainage from [**2115-9-20**].  On ciprofloxacin to cover
   pan-sensitive klebsiella and multi-focal lung infiltrates.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 2 of cipro and day [**5-12**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   5. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
   6. Altered mental status--Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   - When sedation is weaned, she becomes acutely agitated.
   - Enterovirus, HSV PCR, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending, continuing with
   prophylactic Acyclovir for now until HSV from CSF comes back negative,
   then d/c
   5. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing 7.47/28/147/21, patient
   continues on Assist Control with gradual weaning.
   --Will hold off on weaning for now as no change in underlying clinical
   problem.
   --Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off
   6. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet, going to
   continue to watch. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr and if continues to worsen may need to proceed
   with renal replacement Tx
   7. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.
   --F/u viral serologies
   --Transfuse for <10k or if bleeding <50k
   8. L Hydronephrosis/UTI
 Drain remained in place, grew out pan
   sensitive Klebsiella
   -- Will eventually need stone removed and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine
     --> Last UA [**2115-9-20**] showing large blood, neg nitrite/trace LE/[**5-8**]
   WBC/many bacteria, 75 protein, neg glucose/15 ketones
     --> Is improved from UA before that large blood, pos nitrite/mod
   LE/>50 WBCs/mod bacteria
   9. DM2
Concerns that current sliding scale too aggressive so will
   decrease SSI down and watch BS

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status and respiratory failure. She has a history of possible tramadol overdose, multifocal pneumonia, obstructive stone in the left ureter, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently on a ventilator, has a percutaneous nephrostomy tube, and is receiving dobutamine. She has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, increased residuals from tube feeds, hypothyroidism, fevers, anemia, altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's condition is multifactorial and requires careful management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiac function is improving with diuresis, but further evaluation and management are needed.
2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: The patient's decreased gastric emptying may be due to ileus or delayed gastric emptying. This can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia or bowel ischemia.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's elevated TPO levels suggest autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease). Monitoring thyroid function and managing hypothyroidism is crucial.
4. Fevers: The patient has low-grade temperatures and an elevated WBC count, indicating an ongoing infection. Cultures should be followed, and the source of infection should be identified and treated appropriately.
5. Anemia: The"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Added history obtained from husband: pt had several months of
   progressive fatigue (after a week of work she would sleep from friday
   night to monday morning), bags under her eyes, poor coloring, sore back
   but not clearly DOE, weight gain, cold intolerance, hair loss.  Could
   have had symptomatic hypothyroidism?  She did have sleep apnea, which
   may have contributed to these symptoms.
   - Called [**Hospital1 608**]: no blood cx, stool cx negative, urine cx grew >100,000
   pan-sensitive klebsiella.
   - Shut off sedation, patient awoke and was agitated. Not able to follow
   commands.
   - Changed from levo to cipro for better klebsiella coverage based on [**Hospital1 **]
   antibiogram.
   - Added diuril, increase lasix gtt- negative 1.9 liters at 6pm
   - spoke w/ endocrine, they recommended sticking with IV levothyroxine
   and will round tomorrow and comment on possibility of hypothyroid
   encephalopathy.
   - reread chest CT by chest radiologist - did not disagree with prior
   read of multi-focal pneumonia.
   - restarted heparin SC
   - PM labs stable.
   - Patient had increased residuals (600ccs) after tube feeds and has
   gone two days without BMs.  Belly remains soft of exam.  KUB poor
   quality, but no signs of acute abdomen.  Tube feeds held.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive.
   1. Cardiomyopathy--Unclear etiology at present.  Ddx is viral
   myocarditis vs hypothyroidism vs shock heart Continues on Dobutamine,
   but norepinephrine has been stopped.  Cardiac function appears to be
   improving with diuresis.  Long term, once he has stabilized, we can
   consider repeating an echocardiogram and beginning heart failure
   medications (beta blocker) if stabilized.
   --Will continue dobutamine at present to allow for further diuresis.
   --Continue lasix and chlorothiazide with goal further 4L negative
   today.  Will continue while pressures are stable.
   --F/u viral studies that are pending
   2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: Unclear why she is having
   decreased gastric emptying.  Ddx includes SBO (less likely given
   abdomen soft), ileus or delayed gastric emptying.  Gastroparesis is
   common in the setting of sedating meds.  It is worrisome that she has
   not had a bowel movement for a couple of days now.
   - she will likely need sedating meds for a while, and needs nutrition.
   We will ask IR if a post-pyloric dobhoff can be placed to avoid the
   non-motile stomach.
   - bowel regimen to encourage BM.
   - repeat KUB.
   3. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO - given her prior history of
   slowing and weight gain, we are again wondering if this could be
   Hashimoto
s encephalopathy. Myxedema coma not likely given no hypoTN or
   hypothermia.  However, it could be a subclinical hypothyroidism that
   progressively worsened, now with acute insult superimposed and lack of
   appropriate thyroid response.
   - endocrinology will come by again today.
   - Continue with Levothyroxine 25mcg IV daily, no utility in repeating
   thyroid function testing for at least 2 weeks.
   4. Fevers--Continues to have low grade temps and elevated WBC count,
   though overall fever curve may be improving. All cultures beyond
   initial klebsiella continue to be negative.  Other possible source is
   the bibasilar opacities and LUL opacity that appears to be improved on
   yesterday's CXR.  On ciprofloxacin to cover pan-sensitive klebsiella
   and multi-focal lung infiltrates.  Considering the continued
   leukocytosis it would be helpful to screen again for possible bacterial
   infection.
   - Re-culture blood and urine.  Sputum cultures were done recently.
   - F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   - Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 2 of cipro and day [**5-12**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   - Continue to follow CXRs.
   5. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
   - Consider re-consulting heme-onc to assess causes for low retic and
   falling Hct.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21.
   6. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   - Stop acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is negative.
   - When sedation is weaned, she becomes acutely agitated so we will
   continue with light sedation.
   - Enterovirus, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   5. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing 7.47/28/147/21, patient
   continues on Assist Control with gradual weaning.
   - Continue weaning, first by going down on FiO2.
   - Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off.
   - Continue daily CXRs.
   6. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet. Cr
   stable and making good urine. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr which now appears stable.
   7. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.
   8. L Hydronephrosis/UTI
 Drain remained in place, grew out pan
   sensitive Klebsiella
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a complex medical history. She has been admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is multifactorial and includes several potential medical complications.

1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has evidence of cardiomyopathy, possibly due to viral myocarditis, hypothyroidism, or septic shock. There is ongoing discussion about the etiology of her heart condition. The patient is currently on dobutamine and diuretics, and there are plans to repeat an echocardiogram and consider beta-blocker therapy once stabilized.

2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: The patient is experiencing decreased gastric emptying, which could be due to sub-acute bowel obstruction (SBO), ileus, or delayed gastric emptying. Gastroparesis is also a possibility. The patient has not had a bowel movement for a couple of days. Further evaluation is needed, including a repeat KUB and consideration of a post-pyloric feeding tube to avoid the non-motile stomach.

3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has evidence of hypothyroidism with elevated TPO antibodies. This could be related to Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Myxedema coma is less likely given the absence of hypoTN or hypothermia. The patient is being treated with levothyroxine IV and will be followed up by endocrinology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, suspected tramadol overdose, and multiple pulmonary nodules on chest CT. She has continued fevers, respiratory failure, and is currently on a ventilator. She underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement for an obstructive stone in her left ureter. The patient also has acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. She has anti TPO antibodies and remains unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiac function is improving with diuresis, and it is unclear at present. Possible etiologies include viral myocarditis, hypothyroidism, or shock heart. Once stabilized, an echocardiogram may be repeated, and heart failure medications (beta-blocker) can be considered if stabilized.
2. Increased tube feed residuals: The patient is experiencing decreased gastric emptying, with unclear reasons. Differential diagnosis includes small bowel obstruction (less likely given soft abdomen), ileus, or delayed gastric emptying. It is worrisome that the patient has not had a bowel movement for a couple of days now.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has elevated TPO levels and a history of weight gain and slowing. It is possible that this could be Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Myxedema coma is less likely given no hypoTN or hypothermia. The patient is being treated"

   Assessment and Plan
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 INEFFECTIVE COPING
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive.
   1. Cardiomyopathy--Unclear etiology at present.  Ddx is viral
   myocarditis vs hypothyroidism vs shock heart Continues on Dobutamine,
   but norepinephrine has been stopped.
   --Hold off on heart failure regimen for now until hemodynamically
   normalized
s not HTN anyways, but could in long run benefit from
   ACEi and Bblocker
   --Start IV Chlorothiazide
   --F/u viral studies that are pending
   --Consider cardiac MRI to eval for myocarditis, but doubt that this
   would change management
   --Continues on Lasix gtt
   --PA catheter to manage fluid status?

 CE negative x1, BNP elevated 8605 --> [**Numeric Identifier 11024**]

 sepsis induced CMP, myocarditis ([**Location (un) 2636**], viral), pre-existing LV
   dysfxn from EtOH, hypothyroid induced, toxin mediated

 EF 14%, global hypokinesis, effusion but no sign of tamponade
   1. Fevers--Continues to have fevers and WBC count still elevated. BCx's
   continue to be negative. Has positive yeast Cx from sputum but this
   likely commensural flora. Only possible sources are bibasilar opacities
   and LUL opacity that appears to be improved on yesterday's CXR and
   positive urine/fluid Cx from perc nephrostomy tube placement/drainage
   from [**2115-9-20**]. Yesterday, all ABx were pulled off except Levofloxacin
   to treat PNA, which would presumably cover GNR Klebsiella in urine as
   well.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Levaquin today is day [**4-11**]
   --Will hold off on doing bronchoscopy for now as they won
t increase
   the yield of causative [**Doctor Last Name **].
   --Per Pharmacy, would need to switch to Cipro due to this hospital
   antibiograms
 d/c Levo and start Cipro
   --Call Radiology to get better sense of how CXR
s have changed over
   time and whether LUL/bibasilar opacities appear improved
   --Need to call [**Hospital1 608**] OSH to f/u Cx
s that were drawn there, just
   before pt got 3d of Levofloxacin and transfer to [**Hospital1 19**]
   2. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
Could this be a Hashimoto
   encephalopathy? Myxedema coma less likely given no hypoTN or
   hypothermia. Could this have been a subclinical hypothyroidism that
   progressively worsened, now with acute insult superimposed and lack of
   appropriate thyroid response?
   --Need to f/u with Endocrinology
 specifically would ask them to weigh
   in on how this hypothyroidism is affected her heart and contributing to
   EF 10-15%, and what they think about this constellation of problems,
   i.e. how they put this puzzling clinical picture together
   --Continue with Levothyroxine 25mcg IV daily
   --Will need to repeat fT4/TSH to see if achieving therapeutic levels

 TSH 25 --> 19

 T4 <1.0 (4.6-12)

 fT4 0.10 (.93-1.7)

 T3 <20

 TBG normal

 Uptake ratio normal

 fT4 direct analysis pending

 anti-TPO  124 (0-35)
   4. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing  7.34/32/113/18  on CMV 15
   PEEP, 60% FiO2. Pt benefits from increased PEEP.
   --Will hold off on weaning for now as no change in underlying clinical
   problem.
   --Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off
   5. Altered mental status--Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   --Attempt to wean Fentanyl gtt and Versed
 per nursing, pt gets
   agitated when off sedatives, so will not stop completely, just d/c
   continuous and give boluses prn
   --Continue with prophylactic Acyclovir for now until HSV from CSF comes
   back negative, then d/c
     --> LP [**2115-9-20**] without significant WBC's, protein elevated but
   glucose normal
     --> CSF Gstain and cryptococcal Ag negative
     --> CSF HIV pending
     --> Many CSF viral Cx's and serologies pending: enterovirus, HSV PCR,
   West [**Doctor First Name **] serology
     --> DFA for flu negative x1, and insufficient sample on mini BAL
   [**2115-9-23**]
   6. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet, going to
   continue to watch. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr and if continues to worsen may need to proceed
   with renal replacement Tx
   7. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly
   --Continue to trend
   --F/u viral serologies
   --Per Heme Onc, transfuse for <10k or if bleeding <50k
   --Will touch base with Heme Onc about their index of suspicion for HIT,
   and if not high, can likely restart subQ Heparin for prophylaxis in bed
   bound pt.
   Thrombo
penia w/u:
     --> normal coags, not DIC

   negative
     --> ANCA negative, Anticardiolipins IgG and IgM [**Last Name (LF) 1298**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] normal, C3,
   C4 normal
   8. L Hydronephrosis/UTI--Grew out pan sensitive Klebsiella
   --Switch Levofloxacin to Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine
     --> Last UA [**2115-9-20**] showing large blood, neg nitrite/trace LE/[**5-8**]
   WBC/many bacteria, 75 protein, neg glucose/15 ketones

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, possibly due to a Tramadol overdose. She also has multifocal pneumonia seen on chest CT, and her condition has not improved despite treatment. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with sepsis with organ dysfunction. She also has acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient's current medications include levothyroxine, ciprofloxacin, diuretics, dobutamine, heparin, and sedatives. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and liver enzymes. She has positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, indicating possible autoimmune thyroiditis. 

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Her mental status remains altered, and she is unresponsive. The patient has a history of obstructive stone in the left ureter and has undergone a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has reduced ejection fraction (14%) and global hypokinesis on echocardiogram. The etiology is unclear, but possible causes include viral myocarditis, hypothyroidism, or septic shock. Further evaluation with cardiac MRI may be considered.
2. Fevers: The patient continues to have fevers, and her"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is altered mental status and respiratory failure. 

The patient has been experiencing progressive fatigue, bags under the eyes, poor coloring, sore back, weight gain, cold intolerance, and hair loss. These symptoms could indicate symptomatic hypothyroidism. The patient also has a history of sleep apnea, which may have contributed to these symptoms.

The patient's urine culture grew >100,000 pan-sensitive klebsiella, leading to the change from levo to cipro for better klebsiella coverage based on the hospital's antibiogram.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 137/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,199 mL and total output of 7,225 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -4,026 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 26 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O.

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive. Hashimoto's
   encephalopathy not very high on list of probably diagnoses to explain
   her mental status, but very likely cause of her cardiomyopathy, per
   Endo.
   1. Cardiomyopathy--DDx is viral myocarditis vs hypothyroidism vs shock
   heart. Continues on Dobutamine, but norepinephrine has been stopped.
   Cardiac function appears to be improving with diuresis.  Long term,
   once he has stabilized, we can consider repeating an echocardiogram and
   beginning heart failure medications (beta blocker) if stabilized.
   --Continue dobutamine at present to allow for further diuresis.
   --Continue Lasix gtt as is, with overall goal of 3-4L negative again
   today, as pt still up 5L for [**Location 11091**]/u viral studies that are pending
   2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: Unclear why she is having
   decreased gastric emptying.  Ddx includes SBO (less likely given
   abdomen soft), ileus or delayed gastric emptying.  Gastroparesis is
   common in the setting of sedating meds.  It is worrisome that she has
   not had a bowel movement for a couple of days now.
   Had post pyloric Dobhoff placed yesterday for nutrition
   --Increase Lactulose and up titrate to BM
   Doc/Senna/Lactulose
   - repeat KUB.
   3. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO - given her prior history of
   slowing and weight gain, we are again wondering if this could be
   Hashimoto
s encephalopathy. Myxedema coma not likely given no hypoTN or
   hypothermia.  However, it could be a subclinical hypothyroidism that
   progressively worsened, now with acute insult superimposed and lack of
   appropriate thyroid response.
   repeat TFTs in [**4-3**] wks per Endo recs
   Continue with Levothyroxine 25mcg IV daily, no utility in repeating
   thyroid function testing for at least 2 weeks.
   4. Fevers--Last temp [**Age over 90 **] yesterday at 4am. Switched to cipro to cover
   Klebsiella
   UCX and BCx regathered yesterday
   CXR re done yesterday Multifocal consolidation unchanged from immediate
   prior
   radiographs could be pneumonia, but rapid changes pre viously since
   [**9-18**], are more consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema. Persistent
   pericardial effusion.
   Continue cipro day 3, day 7 of fluoroquinolones
   Continues to have low grade temps and elevated WBC count, though
   overall fever curve may be improving. All cultures beyond initial
   klebsiella continue to be negative.  Other possible source is the
   bibasilar opacities and LUL opacity that appears to be improved on
   yesterday's CXR.  On ciprofloxacin to cover pan-sensitive klebsiella
   and multi-focal lung infiltrates.  Considering the continued
   leukocytosis it would be helpful to screen again for possible bacterial
   infection.
   - Re-culture blood and urine.  Sputum cultures were done recently.
   - F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   - Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 3 of cipro and day [**6-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   - Continue to follow CXRs.
   5. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Continue to trend, Hct steady in 24's.
   - Consider re-consulting heme-onc to assess causes for low retic and
   falling Hct.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21.
   6. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   --Will need to continue Propofol for now as pt still a little wild,
   with continued trials of weaning, however already seen to be
   unsuccessful this am
   - Stop acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is negative.
   - When sedation is weaned, she becomes acutely agitated so we will
   continue with light sedation.
   - Enterovirus, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   5. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing 7.42/38/99.[**Numeric Identifier 508**]/25/0   ,
   patient continues on Assist Control with gradual weaning.
   --Continue weaning
   - Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off.
   - Continue daily CXRs.
   6. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet. Cr
   stable and making good urine. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr which now appears stable.
   7. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.
   8. L Hydronephrosis/UTI
 Drain remained in place, grew out pan
   sensitive Klebsiella
   Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   ----Will need reimaging for now
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine
   9. DM2
Concerns that current sliding scale too aggressive so will
   decrease SSI down and watch BS
   ---Lantus 40U and 4U starting at 120 and going up by 2U q 40

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female who was admitted with altered mental status from a possible Tramadol overdose. She has multifocal pneumonia seen on chest CT and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement for an obstructive stone in her left ureter. She also has a reduced ejection fraction of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. The patient continues to be unresponsive, and Hashimoto's encephalopathy is not high on the list of probable diagnoses.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiac function appears to be improving with diuresis, and dobutamine is being continued to allow for further diuresis. Long-term management may include beta blockers if stabilized.
2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: The patient has decreased gastric emptying, which could be due to gastroparesis or other causes. Lactulose has been increased, and the patient's bowel movement status should be monitored.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has elevated TPO antibodies, and repeat thyroid function tests are recommended in 4 weeks. Levothyroxine is being continued at 25mcg IV daily.
4. Fevers: The patient has low-grade temperatures and elevated WBC count, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Cultures beyond"

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive. Hashimoto's
   encephalopathy not very high on list of probably diagnoses to explain
   her mental status, but very likely cause of her cardiomyopathy, per
   Endo.
   1. Cardiomyopathy--DDx is viral myocarditis vs hypothyroidism vs shock
   heart. Continues on Dobutamine, but norepinephrine has been stopped.
   Cardiac function appears to be improving with diuresis.  Long term,
   once he has stabilized, we can consider repeating an echocardiogram and
   beginning heart failure medications (beta blocker) if stabilized.
   --Continue dobutamine at present to allow for further diuresis.
   --Continue Lasix gtt as is, with overall goal of 3-4L negative again
   today, as pt still up 5L for [**Location 11091**]/u viral studies that are pending
   2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: Unclear why she is having
   decreased gastric emptying.  Ddx includes SBO (less likely given
   abdomen soft), ileus or delayed gastric emptying.  Gastroparesis is
   common in the setting of sedating meds.  It is worrisome that she has
   not had a bowel movement for a couple of days now.
   Had post pyloric Dobhoff placed yesterday for nutrition
   --Increase Lactulose and up titrate to BM
   Doc/Senna/Lactulose
   - repeat KUB.
   3. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO - given her prior history of
   slowing and weight gain, we are again wondering if this could be
   Hashimoto
s encephalopathy. Myxedema coma not likely given no hypoTN or
   hypothermia.  However, it could be a subclinical hypothyroidism that
   progressively worsened, now with acute insult superimposed and lack of
   appropriate thyroid response.
   repeat TFTs in [**4-3**] wks per Endo recs
   Continue with Levothyroxine 25mcg IV daily, no utility in repeating
   thyroid function testing for at least 2 weeks.
   4. Fevers--Last temp [**Age over 90 **] yesterday at 4am. Switched to cipro to cover
   Klebsiella
   UCX and BCx regathered yesterday
   CXR re done yesterday Multifocal consolidation unchanged from immediate
   prior
   radiographs could be pneumonia, but rapid changes pre viously since
   [**9-18**], are more consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema. Persistent
   pericardial effusion.
   Continue cipro day 3, day 7 of fluoroquinolones
   Continues to have low grade temps and elevated WBC count, though
   overall fever curve may be improving. All cultures beyond initial
   klebsiella continue to be negative.  Other possible source is the
   bibasilar opacities and LUL opacity that appears to be improved on
   yesterday's CXR.  On ciprofloxacin to cover pan-sensitive klebsiella
   and multi-focal lung infiltrates.  Considering the continued
   leukocytosis it would be helpful to screen again for possible bacterial
   infection.
   - Re-culture blood and urine.  Sputum cultures were done recently.
   - F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   - Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 3 of cipro and day [**6-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   - Continue to follow CXRs.
   5. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Continue to trend, Hct steady in 24's.
   - Consider re-consulting heme-onc to assess causes for low retic and
   falling Hct.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21.
   6. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   --Will need to continue Propofol for now as pt still a little wild,
   with continued trials of weaning, however already seen to be
   unsuccessful this am
   - Stop acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is negative.
   - When sedation is weaned, she becomes acutely agitated so we will
   continue with light sedation.
   - Enterovirus, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   5. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing 7.42/38/99.[**Numeric Identifier 508**]/25/0   ,
   patient continues on Assist Control with gradual weaning.
   --Continue weaning
   - Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off.
   - Continue daily CXRs.
   6. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet. Cr
   stable and making good urine. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr which now appears stable.
   7. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.
   8. L Hydronephrosis/UTI
 Drain remained in place, grew out pan
   sensitive Klebsiella
   Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   ----Will need reimaging for now
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine
   9. DM2
Concerns that current sliding scale too aggressive so will
   decrease SSI down and watch BS
   ---Lantus 40U and 4U starting at 120 and going up by 2U q 40

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted to the ICU for altered mental status following a possible Tramadol overdose. She has a history of hypothyroidism, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and Hashimoto's encephalopathy. She is currently on ventilator support for respiratory failure, and has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 14%. The patient also has multifocal pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusion. She is receiving treatment for suspected Klebsiella infection and has a nephrostomy tube in place due to obstructive stone in the left ureter. Her condition remains unstable, with ongoing fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and low-grade temperatures. The patient's mental status is still unresponsive.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiac function is improving with diuresis, but long-term management will be necessary once she stabilizes. Beta-blockers may be considered if her heart function improves.
2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: The patient is experiencing decreased gastric emptying, which could be due to ileus, delayed gastric emptying, or gastroparesis. A post-pyloric Dobhoff tube has been placed for nutrition, and lactulose has been increased to promote bowel movements.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has elevated TPO antibodies, indicating possible Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Repeat thyroid function tests"

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive. Hashimoto's
   encephalopathy not very high on list of probably diagnoses to explain
   her mental status, but very likely cause of her cardiomyopathy, per
   Endo.
   1. Cardiomyopathy--DDx is viral myocarditis vs hypothyroidism vs shock
   heart. Continues on Dobutamine, but norepinephrine has been stopped.
   Cardiac function appears to be improving with diuresis.  Will need echo
   in the future and likely a heart failure regimen as her BP can tolerate
   it, including Bblocker and ACEi.
   --Has had good UOP with Dobutamine but will try to wean today and watch
   UOP.
   --Continue Lasix gtt as is, with overall goal of 3-4L negative again
   today, as pt still up 5L for [**Location 11091**]/u viral studies that are pending
   2. Increased residuals from tube feeds
Has not had BM for about a week
   now. No bowel sounds. Worrisome for ileus, gastroparesis, possible
   effect of too much sedating meds on the bowel.
   --Had post pyloric Dobhoff placed yesterday for nutrition, is well
   placed
   --Increase Lactulose and up titrate to BM
   --Free water enemas followed by Dulcolax suppositories
   -- repeat KUB to make sure no SBO/LBO
   3. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
Not likely Hashimoto
   encephalopathy, which is diagnosis of exclusion, per Endo.
   Cardiomyopathy most likely is due to hypothyroidism though.
   --Continue thyroxine as is.
   --repeat TFTs in [**4-3**] wks per Endo recs
   4. Fevers--Last temp [**Age over 90 **] yesterday at 4am, afebrile through rest of
   yesterday. WBC
s stable and elevated at 17. Switched to cipro yesterday
   to cover Klebsiella. UCX and BCx regathered yesterday.  CXR re-done
   yesterday more consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema.
   --F/u Cx
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 3 of cipro and day [**6-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   5. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Continue to trend, Hct steady in 24's.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   6. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   --Will need to continue Propofol for now as pt still a little wild,
   with continued trials of weaning, however already seen to be
   unsuccessful this am
   --Have stopped acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is negative.
   --Enterovirus, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
    7. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing 7.42/38/100/25/0, patient
   continues on Assist Control with gradual weaning.
   --Continue weaning, will try to decrease PEEP today
   --Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off.
   --Continue daily CXRs.
   8. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet. Cr
   stable and making good urine. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr which now appears stable.
   9. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly, is up to 140 today
   and increasing
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.
   10. L Hydronephrosis/UTI
 Drain remained in place, grew out pan
   sensitive Klebsiella
   Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   --Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine
   9. DM2--Lantus 40U and 4U starting at 120 and going up by 2U q 40,
   watch BS

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The key points from the note are as follows:

1. The patient was admitted with altered mental status due to a possible Tramadol overdose.
2. She has multifocal pneumonia seen on chest CT and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
3. The patient underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement for an obstructive stone in the left ureter.
4. She has a reduced ejection fraction of 14% with global hypokinesis on echocardiogram, indicating cardiomyopathy.
5. The patient also has acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism.
6. Anti-TPO antibodies were detected, suggesting Hashimoto's encephalopathy, although not highly suspected as the cause of her mental status.
7. The patient is currently receiving dobutamine, furosemide, propofol, and other medications.
8. She has increased residuals from tube feeds and has not had a bowel movement for about a week.
9. There are concerns about ileus, gastroparesis, and possible effects of sedating medications on the bowel.
10. The patient's hypothyroidism with elevated TPO is being treated with thyroxine, and repeat thyroid function tests are recommended in 4 weeks.
11. She has fevers, and the cause is still under investigation. Ciprofloxacin was"

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive. Hashimoto's
   encephalopathy not very high on list of probably diagnoses to explain
   her mental status, but very likely cause of her cardiomyopathy, per
   Endo.
   1. Cardiomyopathy--DDx is viral myocarditis vs hypothyroidism vs shock
   heart. Continues on Dobutamine, but norepinephrine has been stopped.
   Cardiac function appears to be improving with diuresis.  Will need echo
   in the future and likely a heart failure regimen as her BP can tolerate
   it, including Bblocker and ACEi.
   --Has had good UOP with Dobutamine but will try to wean today and watch
   UOP.
   --Continue Lasix gtt as is, with overall goal of 3-4L negative again
   today, as pt still up 5L for [**Location 11091**]/u viral studies that are pending
   2. Increased residuals from tube feeds
Has not had BM for about a week
   now. No bowel sounds. Worrisome for ileus, gastroparesis, possible
   effect of too much sedating meds on the bowel.
   --Had post pyloric Dobhoff placed yesterday for nutrition, is well
   placed
   --Increase Lactulose and up titrate to BM
   -- repeat KUB to make sure no SBO/LBO
   --Free water enemas followed by Dulcolax suppositories
   3. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
Not likely Hashimoto
   encephalopathy, which is diagnosis of exclusion
    given her prior history of slowing and weight gain, we are again
   wondering if this could be Hashimoto
s encephalopathy. Myxedema coma
   not likely given no hypoTN or hypothermia.  However, it could be a
   subclinical hypothyroidism that progressively worsened, now with acute
   insult superimposed and lack of appropriate thyroid response.
   --repeat TFTs in [**4-3**] wks per Endo recs
   Continue with Levothyroxine 25mcg IV daily, no utility in repeating
   thyroid function testing for at least 2 weeks.
   4. Fevers--Last temp [**Age over 90 **] yesterday at 4am. Switched to cipro to cover
   Klebsiella
   UCX and BCx regathered yesterday
   CXR re done yesterday Multifocal consolidation unchanged from immediate
   prior
   radiographs could be pneumonia, but rapid changes pre viously since
   [**9-18**], are more consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema. Persistent
   pericardial effusion.
   Continue cipro day 3, day 7 of fluoroquinolones
   Continues to have low grade temps and elevated WBC count, though
   overall fever curve may be improving. All cultures beyond initial
   klebsiella continue to be negative.  Other possible source is the
   bibasilar opacities and LUL opacity that appears to be improved on
   yesterday's CXR.  On ciprofloxacin to cover pan-sensitive klebsiella
   and multi-focal lung infiltrates.  Considering the continued
   leukocytosis it would be helpful to screen again for possible bacterial
   infection.
   - Re-culture blood and urine.  Sputum cultures were done recently.
   - F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   - Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 3 of cipro and day [**6-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   - Continue to follow CXRs.
   5. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Continue to trend, Hct steady in 24's.
   - Consider re-consulting heme-onc to assess causes for low retic and
   falling Hct.
   - Transfuse for Hct<21.
   6. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   --Will need to continue Propofol for now as pt still a little wild,
   with continued trials of weaning, however already seen to be
   unsuccessful this am
   - Stop acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is negative.
   - When sedation is weaned, she becomes acutely agitated so we will
   continue with light sedation.
   - Enterovirus, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   5. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing 7.42/38/99.[**Numeric Identifier 508**]/25/0   ,
   patient continues on Assist Control with gradual weaning.
   --Continue weaning
   - Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off.
   - Continue daily CXRs.
   6. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet. Cr
   stable and making good urine. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr which now appears stable.
   7. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.

 Drain remained in place, grew out pan
   sensitive Klebsiella

   ----Will need reimaging for now
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status (AMS) from a possible Tramadol overdose. She also has multifocal pneumonia seen on chest CT, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, and a history of Hashimoto's encephalopathy.

The patient has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, most likely due to viral myocarditis, hypothyroidism, or shock heart. She is currently on dobutamine, but norepinephrine has been stopped. The cardiac function appears to be improving with diuresis. An echo in the future and a heart failure regimen are recommended.

The patient's increased residuals from tube feeds, lack of bowel movements, and no bowel sounds indicate a possible ileus, gastroparesis, or effect of sedating medications on the bowel. A post pyloric Dobhoff tube has been placed for nutrition, which is well-placed.

The patient's hypothyroidism with elevated TPO antibodies is not likely to be Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Repeat TFTs in 4 weeks per Endo recs are advised. She is to continue with levothyroxine 25mcg IV daily.

The patient's fevers, low-grade temperatures, and elevated WBC count suggest an ongoing infection. Klebsiella pneumoniae has been identified, and the patient is on ciprofloxacin. Other possible sources"

   Dobhoff not postpyloric
   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive. Hashimoto's
   encephalopathy not very high on list of probably diagnoses to explain
   her mental status, but very likely cause of her cardiomyopathy, per
   Endo.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
Likely from
   hypothyroidism.  Also in differential is viral myocarditis vs shock
   heart. Off Dobutamine and norepinephrine.  Cardiac function appears to
   be improving.  Will need echo in the future and likely a heart failure
   regimen as her BP can tolerate it, including Bblocker and ACEi.
   --Repeat ECHO.
   --Continue Lasix gtt as is, with overall goal of 31-2L negative today
   --F/u viral studies pending
   #.  Fevers
Afebrile >24hrs. WBC
s stable and trending down. Switched to
   cipro yesterday to cover Klebsiella. UCX and BCx regathered yesterday.
   CXR re-done yesterday more consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema.
   --F/u Cx
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 4 of cipro and day [**7-12**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Abdominal distention
KUB concerning for partial obstruction.  No BM
   for approx 1 week, no bowel sounds, concerning for ileus vs
   gastroparesis, possible effect of too much sedating meds on the bowel.
     No response to increased bowel regimen or enemas yesterday.  Dobhoff
   in stomach.  TF held for high residuals.
   --CT abdomen/pelvis to assess for obstruction
   --Pull Dobhoff
   --If no obstruction, lactulose enema
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Continue levothyroxin
   --repeat TFTs in [**4-3**] wks
   #. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism.  However, no improvement in mental status with
   treatment of infection.  Have stopped acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is
   negative.
   --Wean sedation and hold benzos and reassess mental status
   --Enterovirus, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   --If no improvement over the weekend, consider neuro recs
   #. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Continue to trend Hct daily.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #. Respiratory failure
Not tolerating weaning for long yesterday.
   --Continue weaning as tolerated
   --Continue lasix gtt
   --CT chest for underlying cause of failure
   8. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet. Cr
   stable and making good urine. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr which now appears stable.
   9. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly, is up to 140 today
   and increasing
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.
   10. L Hydronephrosis/UTI
 Drain remained in place, grew out pan
   sensitive Klebsiella
   --Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   --Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine.
   #. DM2--Lantus 40U and 4U starting at 120 and going up by 2U q 40,
   watch BS
   #. FEN: lytes and replete as tolerated, hold TF
   #. PPX

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given in the note are as follows:

1. Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which is likely the cause of her cardiomyopathy. Other differential diagnoses include viral myocarditis or shock heart.

2. Fevers: Despite being afebrile for more than 24 hours and having stable WBC count trending down, the patient still has fevers. This may indicate an ongoing infection, and further evaluation is needed.

3. Abdominal Distention: The patient has KUB concerning for partial obstruction, no bowel movements for approximately one week, no bowel sounds, and possible ileus vs gastroparesis. Further imaging, such as a CT abdomen/pelvis, is necessary to assess for obstruction.

4. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO: The patient has hypothyroidism with elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. She is on thyroid replacement therapy, and repeat thyroid function tests (TFTs) are planned in 4 weeks.

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS from possible Tramadol overdose, multifocal
   PNA's seen on chest CT, now with continued fevers, respiratory failure
   currently on ventilator, s/p perc nephrostomy tube for obstructive
   stone in L ureter,  EF of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo,
   acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, now seen to
   have anti TPO antibodes, continues to be unresponsive. Hashimoto's
   encephalopathy not very high on list of probably diagnoses to explain
   her mental status, but very likely cause of her cardiomyopathy, per
   Endo.
   1. Cardiomyopathy--DDx is viral myocarditis vs hypothyroidism vs shock
   heart. Continues on Dobutamine, but norepinephrine has been stopped.
   Cardiac function appears to be improving with diuresis.  Will need echo
   in the future and likely a heart failure regimen as her BP can tolerate
   it, including Bblocker and ACEi.
   --Has had good UOP with Dobutamine but will try to wean today and watch
   UOP.
   --Continue Lasix gtt as is, with overall goal of 3-4L negative again
   today, as pt still up 5L for [**Location 11091**]/u viral studies that are pending
   2. Increased residuals from tube feeds
Has not had BM for about a week
   now. No bowel sounds. Worrisome for ileus, gastroparesis, possible
   effect of too much sedating meds on the bowel.
   --Had post pyloric Dobhoff placed yesterday for nutrition, is well
   placed
   --Increase Lactulose and up titrate to BM
   --Free water enemas followed by Dulcolax suppositories
   -- repeat KUB to make sure no SBO/LBO
   3. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
Not likely Hashimoto
   encephalopathy, which is diagnosis of exclusion, per Endo.
   Cardiomyopathy most likely is due to hypothyroidism though.
   --Continue thyroxine as is.
   --repeat TFTs in [**4-3**] wks per Endo recs
   4. Fevers--Last temp [**Age over 90 **] yesterday at 4am, afebrile through rest of
   yesterday. WBC
s stable and elevated at 17. Switched to cipro yesterday
   to cover Klebsiella. UCX and BCx regathered yesterday.  CXR re-done
   yesterday more consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema.
   --F/u Cx
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 3 of cipro and day [**6-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   5. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism.  Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Continue to trend, Hct steady in 24's.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   6. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism
   --Will need to continue Propofol for now as pt still a little wild,
   with continued trials of weaning, however already seen to be
   unsuccessful this am
   --Have stopped acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is negative.
   --Enterovirus, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
    7. Respiratory failure--Last ABG showing 7.42/38/100/25/0, patient
   continues on Assist Control with gradual weaning.
   --Continue weaning, will try to decrease PEEP today
   --Will continue to diurese with IV Lasix gtt today with goal of several
   L off.
   --Continue daily CXRs.
   8. Acute Renal Failure--Per renal recs, not starting CVVH yet. Cr
   stable and making good urine. Nephrostomy tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr which now appears stable.
   9. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly, is up to 140 today
   and increasing
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.
   10. L Hydronephrosis/UTI
 Drain remained in place, grew out pan
   sensitive Klebsiella
   --Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   --Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute mental status changes (AMS) suspected to be caused by a possible Tramadol overdose. She has multiple comorbidities including cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications such as dobutamine, furosemide, propofol, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiac function is improving with diuresis, but she may require a heart failure regimen including a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor in the future.
2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: The patient has not had a bowel movement for about a week and has no bowel sounds, which is worrisome for ileus, gastroparesis, or possible effects of sedating medications on the bowel.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, indicating possible Hashimoto's encephalopathy, although this is a diagnosis of exclusion. Hypothyroidism is likely causing the cardiomyopathy.
4. Fevers: The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, and she has an elevated white blood cell count. She was switched to ciprofloxacin to cover Klebsiella infection, and cultures and a repeat chest X-ray are pending"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with acute mental status changes from possible tramadol overdose, multifocal pneumonia on chest CT, and ongoing respiratory failure currently on ventilator support. She underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement for an obstructive stone in the left ureter, has an ejection fraction of 14% with global hypokinesis seen on echo, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is unresponsive and not producing bowel movements. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a low ejection fraction and global hypokinesis, indicating poor cardiac function. This could potentially lead to heart failure and require a heart failure regimen including a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor.
2. Increased residuals from tube feeds: The patient has not had a bowel movement for about a week and has no bowel sounds, which could indicate ileus, gastroparesis, or an effect of sedating medications on the bowel. Further evaluation and management are required.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient has elevated TPO antibodies and a low TSH level, suggesting hypothyroidism. This may be the cause of the patient's cardiomyopathy. Thyroxine supplementation is being continued, and repeat thyroid function tests are recommended in 4 weeks.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis from obstructed renal stones, cardiomyopathy likely due to hypothyroidism, and respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury. The patient has been on dobutamine and lasix drip. Bradycardia is present, but stable with good blood pressures. The patient's electrolytes are stable and improving renal function. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows no evidence of bowel obstruction but reveals a probable focal colonic ileus in the right upper abdomen. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is improving to 40% and has a stable pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology. The patient is off dobutamine and norepinephrine, and cardiac function appears to be improving. A heart failure regimen, including a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor, is recommended, along with the continuation of Lasix gtt. The patient also has abdominal distention due to a focal ileus, and conservative measures are being attempted. The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial and not improving with infection treatment. Sedation is being weaned, and neurologic recommendations may be considered if there is no improvement over the weekend. The patient has hypothyroidism with elevated TPO and is on thyroid replacement therapy. She also has pyelonephritis with an obstructive stone and has undergone a percutaneous"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis from obstructed renal stones, cardiomyopathy likely due to hypothyroidism, and respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury.

2. The patient's heart function is improving, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. The pericardial effusion is stable without tamponade physiology, likely caused by hypothyroidism. The patient is off dobutamine and norepinephrine.

3. The patient has abdominal distention with a CT scan showing no evidence of bowel obstruction but a probable focal colonic ileus in the right upper abdomen. The patient is holding TF (total parenteral nutrition) for high residuals and aggressive enemas. No effect of PO narcan (opioid antagonist) has been observed.

4. The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis versus the effect of hypothyroidism. No improvement in mental status has been observed with the treatment of infection. Sedation is being weaned, and benzodiazepines are being held to reassess mental status.

5. The patient has hypothyroidism with elevated TPO (thyroid peroxidase) levels. Thyroid replacement therapy is ongoing, and levothy"

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS, sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc
   nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy likely from hypothyroidism as well as
   respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
EF improving to 40% and
   stable effusion without tamponade physiology.  Likely from
   hypothyroidism.  Also in differential is viral myocarditis vs shock
   heart. Off Dobutamine and norepinephrine.  Cardiac function appears to
   be improving.  Will need a heart failure regimen as her BP can tolerate
   it, including Bblocker and ACEi.  Lasix gtt held.
   --F/u viral studies pending
   --[**Location (un) 2636**] negative, B1 within normal limits
   --Continue Lasix diuresis today with gentle gtt and IV bolus
   #. Abdominal distention
CT negative for obstruction but with focal
   ileus.  Holding TF for high residuals and aggressive enemas.  No effect
   of PO narcan.  No response to increased bowel regimen or enemas
   yesterday.  Dobhoff pulled.
   --Continue with bowel regimen today and watch stool output
   --If stool output doesn
t increase will consult surgery tomorrow to
   inquire about focal RUQ ileus
   #. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism.  However, no improvement in mental status with
   treatment of infection.  Have stopped acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is
   negative.
   --Holding benzos and allowing time for them to clear. Had positive UA
   for benzos yesterday, will need to reassess with repeat UA tomorrow
   --Enterovirus is negative, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   --Wait until urine benzos are negative, then consider neuro consult to
   assess AMS
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Increase levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat TFTs in [**4-3**] wks
   #. Pyelonephritis
L obstructive stone, perc nephrostomy in place,
   cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella.  On Cipro day 6 ([**9-11**]
   of fluroquinolones).
   --Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   --Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine.
    #.  Fevers
Last temp 100 was [**2115-9-27**] at 4pm, afebrile since. WBC
   stable and trending down. Currently on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in
   urine. UCX and BCx regathered [**2115-9-25**] are all still negative.
   --F/u Cx
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 6 of cipro and day [**9-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism. Currently Hct is holding steady in 24-25 range.
   Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Continue to trend Hct daily.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #. Respiratory failure
Not tolerating weaning for long yesterday.
   --Continue weaning as tolerated, decrease PEEP
   --Lasix gtt is now off
   --CT chest with improvement in multifocal PNA
   #. Acute Renal Failure-- Cr stable and making good urine. Nephrostomy
   tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr which now appears stable and improving.
   #. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly, is up to 258 today
   and increasing
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.
   #. DM2--Lantus 40U and 4U starting at 120 and going up by 2U q 40,
   watch BS
   #. FEN:
   - replete lytes and follow [**Hospital1 7**]
   - hold TF
   #. PPX
   - Pneumoboots
   - bowel regimen
   - Famotidine
   - No subQ heparin as she was thrombopenic

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, hyperglycemia, constipation, delirium, altered mental status, fever, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests, including a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, an echocardiogram, and various blood tests. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 98/53 to 118/77 mmHg, heart rate between 62 and 77 bpm, respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but they have low magnesium and potassium levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.48. The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to sedation and the inability to"

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS, sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc
   nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy likely from hypothyroidism as well as
   respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
EF improving to 40% and
   stable effusion without tamponade physiology.  Likely from
   hypothyroidism.  Also in differential is viral myocarditis vs shock
   heart. Off Dobutamine and norepinephrine.  Cardiac function appears to
   be improving.  Will need a heart failure regimen as her BP can tolerate
   it, including Bblocker and ACEi.  Lasix gtt held.
   --F/u viral studies pending
   --[**Location (un) 2636**] negative, B1 within normal limits
   #. Abdominal distention
CT negative for obstruction but with focal
   ileus.  Holding TF for high residuals and aggressive enemas.  No effect
   of PO narcan.  No response to increased bowel regimen or enemas
   yesterday.  Dobhoff pulled.
   --Continue enemas as tolerated
   #. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism.  However, no improvement in mental status with
   treatment of infection.  Have stopped acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is
   negative.
   --Holding benzos and allowing time for them to clear. Had positive UA
   for benzos yesterday, will need to reassess with repeat UA tomorrow
   --Enterovirus is negative, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   --Wait until urine benzos are negative, then consider neuro consult to
   assess AMS
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Increase levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat TFTs in [**4-3**] wks
   #. Pyelonephritis
L obstructive stone, perc nephrostomy in place,
   cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella.  On Cipro day 6 ([**9-11**]
   of fluroquinolones).
   --Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   --Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine.
    #.  Fevers
Last temp 100 was [**2115-9-27**] at 4pm, afebrile since. WBC
   stable and trending down. Currently on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in
   urine. UCX and BCx regathered [**2115-9-25**] are all still negative.
   --F/u Cx
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 6 of cipro and day [**9-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism. Currently Hct is holding steady in 24-25 range.
   Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Continue to trend Hct daily.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #. Respiratory failure
Not tolerating weaning for long yesterday.
   --Continue weaning as tolerated, decrease PEEP
   --Lasix gtt is now off
   --CT chest with improvement in multifocal PNA
   #. Acute Renal Failure-- Cr stable and making good urine. Nephrostomy
   tube not draining pus.
   --Continue to trend Cr which now appears stable and improving.
   #. Thrombocytopenia--Appears to be improving slowly, is up to 258 today
   and increasing
   --Continue to trend in setting of restarting heparin.
   #. DM2--Lantus 40U and 4U starting at 120 and going up by 2U q 40,
   watch BS
   #. FEN:
   - replete lytes and follow [**Hospital1 7**]

   stable effusion without tamponade physiology.  Likely from
   hypothyroidism.  Also in differential is viral myocarditis vs shock
   heart. Off Dobutamine and norepinephrine.  Cardiac function appears to
   be improving.  Will need a heart failure regimen as her BP can tolerate
   it, including Bblocker and ACEi.  Lasix gtt held.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, sepsis from obstructed renal stones post percutaneous nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy likely due to hypothyroidism, and respiratory failure possibly due to acute lung injury. She now has improving cardiac and renal function but still has persistent altered mental status and a new focal right upper quadrant ileus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's lab results show imbalances in electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. There is also a fluid disorder indicated by negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings have been consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
3. Constipation/Obsipation: The patient has abdominal distention and is experiencing obstipation (lack of bowel movement). This could be a result of the ileus or other factors.
4. Delirium/Confusion: Despite treatment for infection, the patient's mental status has not improved, suggesting ongoing delirium or confusion.
5. Ineffective Coping: The patient may be experiencing ineffective coping mechanisms due to her medical conditions and prolonged ICU stay.
6. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis from obstructed renal stones, and although her renal function is improving, there is still a risk of ongoing infection"

 Continues to have altered mental status
   beyond what can be explained by her medications.  The cause is likely
   multifactorial including toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin

   respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury.  Now with improving
   cardiac and renal function, but persistently altered mental status and
   new focal ileus.
   #. Abdominal distention
CT negative for obstruction but with focal
   ileus.  Holding TF for high residuals and aggressive enemas.  No effect
   of PO narcan.  No response to increased bowel regimen or enemas
   yesterday.  Dobhoff pulled.
   --Continue with bowel regimen today and watch stool output
   --If stool output doesn
t increase will consult surgery tomorrow to
   inquire about focal RUQ ileus
   #. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial including toxic
   metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs effect
   of hypothyroidism.  However, no improvement in mental status with
   treatment of infection.  Have stopped acyclovir as HSV PCR from CSF is
   negative.
   --Holding benzos and allowing time for them to clear. Had positive UA
   for benzos yesterday, will need to reassess with repeat UA tomorrow
   --Enterovirus is negative, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   --Wait until urine benzos are negative, then consider neuro consult to
   assess AMS
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
EF improving to 40% and
   stable effusion without tamponade physiology.  Likely from
   hypothyroidism.  Also in differential is viral myocarditis vs shock
   heart. Off Dobutamine and norepinephrine.  Cardiac function appears to
   be improving.  Will need a heart failure regimen as her BP can tolerate
   it, including Bblocker and ACEi.  Lasix gtt held.
   --F/u viral studies pending
   --[**Location (un) 2636**] negative, B1 within normal limits
   --Continue Lasix diuresis today with gentle gtt and IV bolus
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per

   --Increase levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat TFTs in [**4-3**] wks
   #. Pyelonephritis
L obstructive stone, perc nephrostomy in place,
   cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella.  On Cipro day 6 ([**9-11**]
   of fluroquinolones).
   --Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   --Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   -- Cipro as above to cover Klebsiella from urine.
    #.  Fevers
Last temp 100 was [**2115-9-27**] at 4pm, afebrile since. WBC
   stable and trending down. Currently on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in
   urine. UCX and BCx regathered [**2115-9-25**] are all still negative.
   --F/u Cx
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 6 of cipro and day [**9-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Anemia
Patient
s Hct has been trending down slowly, likely due to
   marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection vs.
   hypothyroidism. Currently Hct is holding steady in 24-25 range.
   Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Continue to trend Hct daily.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #. Respiratory failure
Not tolerating weaning for long yesterday.
   --Continue weaning as tolerated, decrease PEEP
   --Lasix gtt is now off

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis from obstructed renal stones, cardiomyopathy likely due to hypothyroidism, and respiratory failure possibly resulting from acute lung injury. The patient has been improving in terms of cardiac and renal function but continues to have persistently altered mental status and a new focal ileus. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance with high potassium levels (K+ 5.2 mEq/L) and low calcium levels (Ca++ 8.4 mg/dL). There is also a fluid disorder with negative fluid balance (-1,010 mL) and ongoing losses through various routes (NG, TF, urine).

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (BP 143/51 mmHg), indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, cardiomyopathy, or fluid imbalances.

3. Constipation/Obstipation: The patient has abdominal distention and a focal ileus, indicating constipation or obstipation. Enemas and increased bowel regimen have not been effective so far.

4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient continues to have altered mental status (AMS), which is likely multifactorial including toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis versus the effect of hypothyroidism. Benzodiaz"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status, and they have a history of elevated amylase and lipase levels, suggesting possible pancreatitis. The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), haloperidol (Haldol), fentanyl, and midazolam (Versed).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 143/51 mmHg to 79/41 mmHg, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). There are also abnormalities in kidney function tests such as creatinine (Cr), blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes like aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase ("

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS, sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc
   nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy likely from hypothyroidism as well as
   respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury.  Now with improving
   cardiac and renal function, but persistently altered mental status and
   new focal ileus.
   #. Altered mental status
 Mental status improving, now able to follow
   commands, but very aggitated when not sedated.  Yesterday ok with
   Presodex only, but requried fentanyl/midazolam for MRI, now unable to
   toleate only Presodex so giving some midazolam.  Avoid propofol as with
   pancreatitis, and fentanyl given ileus.  Lkely cause of AMS
   multifactorial including prolonged effect of sedating medications,
   toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs
   effect of hypothyroidism.  Though she had some improvement with
   treatment of her infection and now wakes up to move spontaneously and
   ask for help, we suspect some remaining underlying process.  MRI head
   pending.
   --Neurology consult for their input.
   -- f/u MRI head w/o contrast
   --Enterovirus is negative, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   #. Pancreatitis/ileus
Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to the
   Propofol, as the CT abdomen [**9-27**] showed no signs of cholelithiasis.
   The ileus has improved this morning with active bowel sounds, 1 bowel
   movement but improved distention.
   --Continue with bowel regimen today and watch stool output
   --If stool output doesn
t increase will consult surgery tomorrow to
   inquire about focal RUQ ileus
   --Consider GoLytely
   #.  Fevers/leukocytosis
Low-grade temp and white count decreased this
   morning. Currently only on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in urine. UCX and
   BCx regathered [**2115-9-25**] are all still negative, recultured yesterday.
   --Repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures for source of new
   leukocytosis.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 8 of cipro and day [**11-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Pyelonephritis
Pulled out perc nephrostomy tube yesterday, replaced
   by IR. Cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella.  On Cipro day 8
   ([**11-11**] of fluroquinolones).
   -- Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   -- Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
EF improved to 40% and
   stable effusion without tamponade physiology.  Likely from
   hypothyroidism and septic shock.  Required pressors for sedation.  All
   viral cultures negative to date.
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Continue levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat TFTs in [**3-3**] wks
   #. Anemia
Patient
s Hct decreased by 4 today without any obvious source
   of beeding, however, similar to previous baseline.  Underlying anemia
   likely due to marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection
   vs. hypothyroidism. Currently Hct is holding steady in 24-25 range.
   Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Repeat Hct
   --Continue to trend Hct daily.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #. Respiratory failure
Not tolerating weaning for long yesterday.
   --Continue weaning as tolerated, decrease PEEP
   --Lasix gtt is now off because of hypotension.
   --CT chest with improvement in multifocal PNA
   #. DM2
Off of lantus and on regular sliding scale every 6 hours to
   cover tube feeds.
   #. FEN:
   - Currently NPO and receiving TPN because of ileus.  Can consider going
   back to tube feeds when pnacreatitis improves.
   #. PPX
   - Pneumoboots and SC heparin.
   - bowel regimen
   - H2
   # Code: Full
   # Dispo: ICU pending improvement in mental and respiratory status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis due to obstructed renal stones post percutaneous nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy likely from hypothyroidism as well as respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury. She has been improving in terms of cardiac and renal function but still has persistent altered mental status and new focal ileus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient has been experiencing AMS, which has improved but is still present. Possible causes include prolonged effects of sedating medications, toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis, and hypothyroidism. An MRI head is pending for further evaluation.

2. Pancreatitis/Ileus: The patient has pancreatitis likely secondary to Propofol, as there are no signs of cholelithiasis on CT abdomen. The ileus has improved with active bowel sounds and one bowel movement. A bowel regimen is being continued, and if stool output does not increase, a consultation with surgery will be sought for focal RUQ ileus.

3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient had low-grade fever and leukocytosis but is currently improving. She is only on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in urine. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been repeated for the source of new leukocytosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with AMS, sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc
   nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy likely from hypothyroidism as well as
   respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury.  Now with improving
   cardiac and renal function, but persistently altered mental status and
   new focal ileus.
   #. Altered mental status
 Mental status improving, now able to follow
   commands, but very aggitated when not sedated.  Yesterday ok with
   Presodex only, but requried fentanyl/midazolam for MRI, now unable to
   toleate only Presodex so giving some midazolam.  Avoid propofol as with
   pancreatitis, and fentanyl given ileus.  Lkely cause of AMS
   multifactorial including prolonged effect of sedating medications,
   toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs
   effect of hypothyroidism.  Though she had some improvement with
   treatment of her infection and now wakes up to move spontaneously and
   ask for help, we suspect some remaining underlying process.  MRI head
   pending.
   --Neurology consult for their input.
   -- f/u MRI head w/o contrast
   --Enterovirus is negative, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   --Start Haldol for agitation after EKG for QT interval evaluation
   #. Pancreatitis/ileus
Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to the
   Propofol, as the CT abdomen [**9-27**] showed no signs of cholelithiasis.
   The ileus has improved this morning with active bowel sounds, 1 bowel
   movement but improved distention.
   --Continue with bowel regimen today and watch stool output
   --If stool output doesn
t increase will consult surgery tomorrow to
   inquire about focal RUQ ileus
   --Consider GoLytely
   #.  Fevers/leukocytosis
Low-grade temp and white count decreased this
   morning. Currently only on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in urine. UCX and
   BCx regathered [**2115-9-25**] are all still negative, recultured yesterday.
   --Repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures for source of new
   leukocytosis.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 8 of cipro and day [**11-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Pyelonephritis
Pulled out perc nephrostomy tube yesterday, replaced
   by IR. Cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella.  On Cipro day 8
   ([**11-11**] of fluroquinolones).
   -- Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   -- Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   --Monitor urine output from nephrostomy tube
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
EF improved to 40% and
   stable effusion without tamponade physiology.  Likely from
   hypothyroidism and septic shock.  Required pressors for sedation.  All
   viral cultures negative to date.
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Continue levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat TFTs in [**3-3**] wks
   #. Anemia
Patient
s Hct decreased by 4 today without any obvious source
   of beeding, however, similar to previous baseline.  Underlying anemia
   likely due to marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection
   vs. hypothyroidism. Currently Hct is holding steady in 24-25 range.
   Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Repeat Hct
   --active T&S
   --Continue to trend Hct daily.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #. Respiratory failure
Not tolerating weaning for long yesterday.
   --Continue weaning as tolerated, decrease PEEP
   --Lasix gtt is now off because of hypotension.
   --CT chest with improvement in multifocal PNA
   #. DM2
Off of lantus and on regular sliding scale every 6 hours to
   cover tube feeds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), sepsis from obstructed renal stones, cardiomyopathy likely due to hypothyroidism, and respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury. 

The patient has had several medical complications during her ICU stay. These include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been improving but she remains agitated when not sedated. She is currently on Presodex and midazolam for sedation due to the agitation.

2. Pancreatitis/Ileus: The patient likely developed pancreatitis secondary to Propofol infusion. She also had focal ileus which has since improved.

3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient had low-grade temperature and leukocytosis but these have decreased with ongoing treatment. She is currently on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in her urine.

4. Pyelonephritis: The patient had pyelonephritis due to obstructed renal stones. She had a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed, which was later replaced by IR due to blockage. Cultures confirmed pan-sensitive Klebsiella infection.

5. Cardiomyopathy/Pericardial Effusion: The patient developed cardiomyopathy and pericardial effusion, likely due to hypothyroidism and septic shock. Her ejection fraction improved to 40"

   cardiac and renal function, but persistently altered mental status and
   new focal ileus.
   #. Altered mental status
 Mental status improving, now able to follow
   commands, but very aggitated when not sedated.  Agitated on precedex,
   so we are using fentanyl/versed.  When she is awake she is severely
   agitated with signs of possible delirium.  MRI showed no acute
   process.  Further work-up will have to wait for when her lung process,
   pancreatitis and fevers have improved.  West Nile virus negative
   --Appreciate neurology recs.  However, patient is not taking POs and
   can therefore not receive Seroquel.  We will hold off on a psychiatry
   consult until her other issues have improved.
   --Continue Haldol 1mg TID.
   #. Pancreatitis/ileus
Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to the
   Propofol, as the CT abdomen [**9-27**] showed no signs of cholelithiasis.
   She is having continued fevers and now has increasing pleural
   effusions.  We will get a abdominal CT to assess for the extent of the
   pancreatitis and possible fluid collection.
   --No contrast abdominal CT.
   --She will go today for post-pyloric dobhoff placement by IR.
   --Continue TPN until she is getting adequate tube feeds.
   #.  Fevers/leukocytosis
Continued fevers and slight rise in
   leukocytosis today.  We had been attributing this inflammation to
   pancreatitis, but there is still concern for infection, especially
   considering her worsening CXR.  Could there be infection of the
   pericardial fluid?  The pulmonary effusions are not large enough for a
   diagnostic tap. Currently only on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in urine.
   Blood cx, urine cx and c.diff negative to date.
   --Repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures for source of new
   leukocytosis.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 9 of cipro and day 13/14 of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Respiratory failure
Continues to require assist control and CXR
   looks worse today.  It is unclear what process is going on in her
   lungs, whether she continues to have a concurrent, multi-focal
   pneumonia that is incompletely covered with cipro, or if she is now
   developing ARDS.
   --Continue to follow daily CXR
   --Wean ventilatory settings as tolerated.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
Unclear why the pericardial
   effusion is increasing on CXR.  We had been attributing the effusion to
   hypothyroidism, but if it is increasing while he is receiving
   levothyroxine, we may need to search for another etiology. Last echo
   showed that EF had improved to 40% and stable effusion without
   tamponade physiology.  All viral cultures negative to date.
   - Re-consult cardiology for possible drainage of pericardial fluid or
   repeat echo.  Will repeat echocardiography tomorrow.
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Continue levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat TFTs in [**3-3**] wks
   #. Pyelonephritis
Pulled out perc nephrostomy tube and had it replaced.
   Cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella.  On Cipro day 8 (13/14
   of fluroquinolones).  Still draining ~300ccs per day from the
   nephrostomy tube.
   -- Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   -- Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed eventually.
   #. Anemia
Hematocrit is currently stable.  Most likely cause of anemia
   is marrow suppression in the setting of sepsis, compounded by frequent
   blood draws.
   --Continue to trend Hct daily.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.

 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   59yoF admitted with AMS, sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc
   nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy likely from hypothyroidism as well as
   respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury.  Now with improving
   cardiac and renal function, but persistently altered mental status and
   new focal ileus.
   #. Altered mental status
 Mental status improving, now able to follow
   commands, but very aggitated when not sedated.  Yesterday ok with
   Presodex only, but requried fentanyl/midazolam for MRI, now unable to
   toleate only Presodex so giving some midazolam.  Avoid propofol as with
   pancreatitis, and fentanyl given ileus.  Lkely cause of AMS
   multifactorial including prolonged effect of sedating medications,
   toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs
   effect of hypothyroidism.  Though she had some improvement with
   treatment of her infection and now wakes up to move spontaneously and
   ask for help, we suspect some remaining underlying process.  MRI head
   pending.
   --Neurology consult for their input.
   -- f/u MRI head w/o contrast
   --Enterovirus is negative, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   --Start Haldol for agitation after EKG for QT interval evaluation
   #. Pancreatitis/ileus
Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to the
   Propofol, as the CT abdomen [**9-27**] showed no signs of cholelithiasis.
   The ileus has improved this morning with active bowel sounds, 1 bowel
   movement but improved distention.
   --Continue with bowel regimen today and watch stool output
   --If stool output doesn
t increase will consult surgery tomorrow to
   inquire about focal RUQ ileus
   --Consider GoLytely
   #.  Fevers/leukocytosis
Low-grade temp and white count decreased this
   morning. Currently only on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in urine. UCX and
   BCx regathered [**2115-9-25**] are all still negative, recultured yesterday.
   --Repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures for source of new
   leukocytosis.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 8 of cipro and day [**11-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Pyelonephritis
Pulled out perc nephrostomy tube yesterday, replaced
   by IR. Cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella.  On Cipro day 8
   ([**11-11**] of fluroquinolones).
   -- Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   -- Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   --Monitor urine output from nephrostomy tube
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
EF improved to 40% and
   stable effusion without tamponade physiology.  Likely from
   hypothyroidism and septic shock.  Required pressors for sedation.  All
   viral cultures negative to date.
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Continue levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat TFTs in [**3-3**] wks
   #. Anemia
Patient
s Hct decreased by 4 today without any obvious source
   of beeding, however, similar to previous baseline.  Underlying anemia
   likely due to marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection
   vs. hypothyroidism. Currently Hct is holding steady in 24-25 range.
   Hemolysis labs were negative.
   --Repeat Hct
   --active T&S
   --Continue to trend Hct daily.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #. Respiratory failure
Not tolerating weaning for long yesterday.
   --Continue weaning as tolerated, decrease PEEP
   --Lasix gtt is now off because of hypotension.
   --CT chest with improvement in multifocal PNA
   #. DM2
Off of lantus and on regular sliding scale every 6 hours to
   cover tube feeds.
   #. FEN:
   - Currently NPO and receiving TPN because of ileus.
   - Dobhoff in IR
   #. PPX

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has imbalances in potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-) levels, which need to be monitored and corrected if necessary.

2. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be attributed to various factors such as prolonged sedating medications, toxic metabolic injury to the brain, hypothyroidism, or sepsis. It is important to continue evaluating and managing this condition.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to Propofol administration. Pancreatitis can lead to complications like necrosis, abscess formation, and systemic inflammation.

4. Ileus: The patient has developed focal ileus, which can result in bowel obstruction, distension, and decreased bowel movement. Monitoring the patient's bowel sounds and stool output is crucial.

5. Pyelonephritis: The patient had an episode of pyelonephritis, characterized by positive cultures for pan-sensitive Klebsiella. This infection can progress to kidney abscesses if not appropriately managed.

6. Cardiomyopathy and pericardial effusion: The patient has evidence of cardiomyopathy and pericardial effusion, likely due to hypothyroidism and septic shock. Regular monitoring of cardiac function and effusion size is"

   59yoF admitted with AMS, sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc

   respiratory failure likely from acute lung injury.  Now with improving
   cardiac and renal function, but persistently altered mental status and
   new focal ileus.
   #. Altered mental status
 Mental status improving, now able to follow
   commands, but very aggitated when not sedated.  Yesterday ok with
   Presodex only, but requried fentanyl/midazolam for MRI, now unable to
   toleate only Presodex so giving some midazolam.  Avoid propofol as with
   pancreatitis, and fentanyl given ileus.  Lkely cause of AMS
   multifactorial including prolonged effect of sedating medications,
   toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis vs
   effect of hypothyroidism.  Though she had some improvement with
   treatment of her infection and now wakes up to move spontaneously and
   ask for help, we suspect some remaining underlying process.  MRI head
   pending.
   --Neurology consult for their input.
   -- f/u MRI head w/o contrast
   --Enterovirus is negative, West [**Doctor First Name **] serology are pending
   --Start Haldol for agitation after EKG for QT interval evaluation
   #. Pancreatitis/ileus
Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to the
   Propofol, as the CT abdomen [**9-27**] showed no signs of cholelithiasis.
   The ileus has improved this morning with active bowel sounds, 1 bowel
   movement but improved distention.
   --Continue with bowel regimen today and watch stool output
   --If stool output doesn
t increase will consult surgery tomorrow to
   inquire about focal RUQ ileus
   --Consider GoLytely
   #.  Fevers/leukocytosis
Low-grade temp and white count decreased this
   morning. Currently only on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in urine. UCX and
   BCx regathered [**2115-9-25**] are all still negative, recultured yesterday.
   --Repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures for source of new
   leukocytosis.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 8 of cipro and day [**11-11**] of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Pyelonephritis
Pulled out perc nephrostomy tube yesterday, replaced
   by IR. Cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella.  On Cipro day 8
   ([**11-11**] of fluroquinolones).
   -- Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   -- Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   --Monitor urine output from nephrostomy tube
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
EF improved to 40% and
   stable effusion without tamponade physiology.  Likely from
   hypothyroidism and septic shock.  Required pressors for sedation.  All
   viral cultures negative to date.
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Continue levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat TFTs in [**3-3**] wks
   #. Anemia
Patient
s Hct decreased by 4 today without any obvious source
   of beeding, however, similar to previous baseline.  Underlying anemia
   likely due to marrow suppression in setting of overwhelming infection
   vs. hypothyroidism. Currently Hct is holding steady in 24-25 range.
   Hemolysis labs were negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with altered mental status, sepsis, cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, pancreatitis, ileus, leukocytosis, and pyelonephritis. She has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, anemia, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient has had multiple medical complications and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status may be due to prolonged sedating medications, toxic metabolic injury to the brain from toxin ingestion or sepsis, or the effect of hypothyroidism. An MRI head is pending for further evaluation.
2. Pancreatitis/Ileus: Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to Propofol, as the CT abdomen showed no signs of cholelithiasis. The ileus has improved with active bowel sounds and one bowel movement, but the patient is still NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition).
3. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient had low-grade temperature and white count decreased this morning. She is currently only on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in urine. Repeat blood, urine, and sputum cultures are needed to identify the source of new leukocytosis.

   59yoF admitted with several months of cognitive slowing and acute AMS,
   sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy
   likely from hypothyroidism as well as respiratory failure likely from
   multi-focal pneumonia.  Unclear main underlying cause.  Now
   persistently altered mental status with extreme agitation, continued
   respiratory failure and new pancreatitis.
   #. Altered mental status
 Mental status improving, now able to follow
   commands, but extremely agitated when not sedated.  Self-extubated
   twice yesterday.  Agitated on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we are using
   fentanyl/versed.  When she is awake she is severely agitated with signs
   of possible delirium.  MRI showed no acute process.  Further work-up
   will have to wait for when her lung process, pancreatitis and fevers
   have improved.  West Nile virus negative
   --Appreciate neurology recs.  However, patient is not taking POs and
   can therefore not receive Seroquel.  We will hold off on a psychiatry
   consult until her other issues have improved.
   --Continue Haldol 1mg TID.
   #. Pancreatitis/ileus
Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to the
   Propofol, as the CT abdomen [**9-27**] showed no signs of cholelithiasis.
   She is having continued fevers and now has increasing pleural
   effusions.  We will get a abdominal CT to assess for the extent of the
   pancreatitis and possible fluid collection.
   --No contrast abdominal CT.
   --She will go today for post-pyloric dobhoff placement by IR.
   --Continue TPN until she is getting adequate tube feeds.
   #.  Fevers/leukocytosis
Continued fevers and slight rise in
   leukocytosis today.  We had been attributing this inflammation to
   pancreatitis, but there is still concern for infection, especially
   considering her worsening CXR.  Could there be infection of the
   pericardial fluid?  The pulmonary effusions are not large enough for a
   diagnostic tap. Currently only on Cipro to cover Klebsiella in urine.
   Blood cx, urine cx and c.diff negative to date.
   --Repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures for source of new
   leukocytosis.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   --Continue with Ciprofloxacin. Today is day 9 of cipro and day 13/14 of
   fluroquinolones.
   --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Respiratory failure
Continues to require assist control and CXR
   looks worse today.  It is unclear what process is going on in her
   lungs, whether she continues to have a concurrent, multi-focal
   pneumonia that is incompletely covered with cipro, or if she is now
   developing ARDS.
   --Continue to follow daily CXR
   --Wean ventilatory settings as tolerated.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
Unclear why the pericardial
   effusion is increasing on CXR.  We had been attributing the effusion to
   hypothyroidism, but if it is increasing while he is receiving
   levothyroxine, we may need to search for another etiology. Last echo
   showed that EF had improved to 40% and stable effusion without
   tamponade physiology.  All viral cultures negative to date.
   - Re-consult cardiology for possible drainage of pericardial fluid or
   repeat echo.  Will repeat echocardiography tomorrow.
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Continue levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat TFTs in [**3-3**] wks
   #. Pyelonephritis
Pulled out perc nephrostomy tube and had it replaced.
   Cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella.  On Cipro day 8 (13/14
   of fluroquinolones).  Still draining ~300ccs per day from the
   nephrostomy tube.
   -- Continue for total 14d course of Cipro
   -- Will need reimaging if the future per ID recs to assess for abscess
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed eventually.
   #. Anemia
Hematocrit is currently stable.  Most likely cause of anemia
   is marrow suppression in the setting of sepsis, compounded by frequent
   blood draws.
   --Continue to trend Hct daily.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.

 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   59yoF admitted with several months of cognitive slowing and acute AMS,
   sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy
   likely from hypothyroidism as well as respiratory failure likely from
   multi-focal pneumonia.  Unclear main underlying cause.  Now
   persistently altered mental status with extreme agitation, continued
   respiratory failure and new pancreatitis.
   #. Altered mental status
 Self-extubated twice yesterday.  We are
   using fentanyl/versed because she was persistently agitated on precedex
   and propofol caused pancreatitis.  It is hard to assess if the haldol
   has helped.  When she is awake she remains severely agitated with signs
   of possible delirium.  MRI showed no acute process.  She was in acute
   distress when extubated and has an impressive ongoing process in her
   lungs, so she needs to remain intubated for now, preventing us from
   weaning further.
   --Appreciate neurology recs.  Now that the patient has a dobhoff in
   place, we can consider changing him over to Seroquel [**Hospital1 7**] instead of
   Haldol with risperdal for acute agitation.
   #.  Fevers/leukocytosis
It remains unclear why the patient has
   low-grade fevers.  They may be caused by the pancreatitis, but her
   abdominal CT was not particularly impressive.  Could there be infection
   of the pericardial fluid?  Cardiology does not think that is a likely
   source and are not keen on a diagnostic pericardiocentesis.  She has
   evidence of pulmonary infection, though it is unclear how that ties in
   with her overall picture.  The pulmonary effusions are not large enough
   for a diagnostic tap.  She has completed a course of ciprofloxacin (14
   days of quinolones), and as we do not have another source of
   infections, we will stop antibiotics for now, and culture for fevers.
   --Repeat blood, urine and sputum cultures if she spikes a fever again.
   --If she continues to be febrile today, will consult ID in AM tomorrow.
   --F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
    --Continue to follow CXRs.
   #. Pancreatitis/ileus
Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to the
   Propofol.  There were no signs of severe pancreatitis or complications
   on CT scan.  Per radiology there is no clear radiologic evidence of
   pancreatitis.  The plan for now is supportive care.  It is difficult
   for us to assess whether the pancreatitis is improving or worsening.
   --Start tube feeds by post-pyloric dobhoff.
   #. Respiratory failure
Yesterday when extubated she maintained good O2
   sats, but was in tachypneic and in distress, mouthing that she could
   not breath.  Her CXR looks slightly improved today.  We will try a
   trial of pressure support, to assess whether she can be weaned further.
   --Continue to follow daily CXR
   --Wean ventilatory settings as tolerated.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
Unclear why the pericardial
   effusion is increasing on CXR.  We had been attributing the effusion to
   hypothyroidism, but if it is increasing while he is receiving
   levothyroxine, we may need to search for another etiology. Last echo
   showed that EF had improved to 40% and stable effusion without
   tamponade physiology.  All viral cultures negative to date.
   - Re-consult cardiology for possible drainage of pericardial fluid or
   repeat echo.  Will repeat echocardiography tomorrow.
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Continue levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   --repeat thyroid panel tomorrow, per endocrine recommendations.
   #. Pyelonephritis
Pulled out perc nephrostomy tube and had it replaced.
   Cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella and has completed a
   course of cipro.  Still has adequate drainage (~500ccs per day) from
   the nephrostomy tube.
   -- d/c cipro today
   -- Will need reimaging in the future per ID recs to assess for abscess.
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   #. Anemia
Hematocrit drop this morning, repeat draw is pending.  Has
   slowly been drifting down, which have attributed to marrow suppression
   in the setting of sepsis, compounded by frequent blood draws.
   --f/u PM crit.
   --Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #. DM2
Off of lantus, getting insulin with TPN and on regular sliding
   scale every 6 hours.
   #. FEN:
   - Will continue TPN until she is getting enough tube feeds to support
   her nutritionally.
   - replete lytes PRN
   #. PPX
   - Pneumoboots and SC heparin.
   - bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with cognitive slowing, acute altered mental status, sepsis due to obstructed renal stones post-percutaneous nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy likely from hypothyroidism, and respiratory failure likely from multi-focal pneumonia. The main underlying cause is unclear. The patient has been persistently altered with extreme agitation, continued respiratory failure, and new-onset pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient remains severely agitated with signs of possible delirium. It is difficult to assess if the Haldol has helped. An MRI showed no acute process. She was in acute distress when extubated and has an impressive ongoing process in her lungs, so she needs to remain intubated for now, preventing further weaning.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has low-grade fevers. It remains unclear why the patient has fevers. They may be caused by the pancreatitis, but her abdominal CT was not particularly impressive. Could there be an infection of the pericardial fluid? Cardiology does not think that is a likely source and are not keen on a diagnostic pericardiocentesis.

   Assessment and Plan
   59yoF admitted with several months of cognitive slowing and acute AMS,
   sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy
   likely from hypothyroidism as well as respiratory failure likely from
   multi-focal pneumonia.  Unclear main underlying cause.  Now
   persistently altered mental status with extreme agitation, continued
   respiratory failure and new pancreatitis.
   #. Altered mental status
 We are using fentanyl/versed because she was
   persistently agitated on precedex and propofol caused pancreatitis.
   Haldol switched to Seroquel yesterday.  When she is awake she remains
   severely agitated with signs of possible delirium.  MRI showed no acute
   process.
   --Wean sedation as tolerated.
   #.  Fevers/leukocytosis
It remains unclear why the patient has
   low-grade fevers.  They may be caused by the pancreatitis, but her
   abdominal CT without obvious source.    Cardiology does not think that
   is a likely source and are not keen on a diagnostic
   pericardiocentesis.  The pulmonary effusions are not large enough for a
   diagnostic tap.  She has completed a course of ciprofloxacin (14 days
   of quinolones) for pyelonephritis, and as we do not have another source
   of infections, we will stop antibiotics for now, and culture for
   fevers.
   - Consult ID
   - F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   - f/u ECHO -> could effusion be loculated or infected?
   - ID consult for fever source
   #. Pancreatitis/ileus
Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to the
   Propofol.  There were no signs of severe pancreatitis or complications
   on CT scan.  Per radiology there is no clear radiologic evidence of
   pancreatitis.  The plan for now is supportive care.  It is difficult
   for us to assess whether the pancreatitis is improving or worsening.
   Ileus improving given increased BM.
   --Start tube feeds by post-pyloric dobhoff.
   #. Respiratory failure
Tolerated a trial of pressure support.   S/p
   acute lung injury vs multifocal PNA.  Now with persistant unexplained
   effusions.
   --Wean ventilatory settings as tolerated, if tolerates SBT ->
   Extubation.
   #. Anemia
Hct trending down without obvious source of bleeding.  Source
   likely marrow suppression in the setting of sepsis, compounded by
   frequent blood draws.  Platelets and coags stable, hemolysis unlikely
   and previous labs negative.  No iron studies in system.
   - transfuse 1 unit pRBC
   - guiac stools
   - iron studies, retic count
   - active type and screen
   - Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
Unclear why the pericardial
   effusion is increasing on CXR.  We had been attributing the effusion to
   hypothyroidism, but if it is increasing while he is receiving
   levothyroxine, we may need to search for another etiology. Last echo
   showed that EF had improved to 40% and stable effusion without
   tamponade physiology.  All viral cultures negative to date.
   - Re-consult cardiology for possible drainage of pericardial fluid or
   repeat echo.
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Repeat TFTs pending
   --Continue levothyroxin to 50 IV qday
   #. Pyelonephritis
Pulled out perc nephrostomy tube and had it replaced.
   Cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella and has completed a
   course of cipro.  Still has adequate drainage (~500ccs per day) from
   the nephrostomy tube.
   -- d/c cipro today
   -- Will need reimaging in the future per ID recs to assess for abscess.
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
   #. DM2
Off of lantus, getting insulin with TPN and on regular sliding
   scale every 6 hours.
   #. FEN:
   - Stop TPN because she is getting enough tube feeds to support her
   nutritionally.
   - replete lytes PRN
   #. PPX
   - Pneumoboots and SC heparin.
   - bowel regimen
 has mushroom tube in today to allow for bowel
   movements.
   - H2 blocker for ulcer prophylaxis (famotidine)

The patient's condition has evolved with persistent altered mental status, extreme agitation, continued respiratory failure, and new-onset pancreatitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient remains severely agitated with signs of possible delirium. It is important to monitor and manage her agitation and mental status changes closely.

2. Fevers/leukocytosis: Despite completing a course of ciprofloxacin for pyelonephritis, the patient continues to have low-grade fevers. The source of infection needs to be identified, and further cultures and serologies should be followed up.

3. Pancreatitis/ileus: The patient developed pancreatitis likely secondary to propofol. Supportive care is being provided, and tube feeds are being initiated through a post-pyloric Dobhoff tube.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient tolerated a trial of pressure support and requires weaning of ventilatory settings. Persistent unexplained effusions are also present.

 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   59yoF admitted with several months of cognitive slowing and acute AMS,
   sepsis from obstructed renal stone s/p perc nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy
   likely from hypothyroidism as well as respiratory failure likely from
   multi-focal pneumonia.  Unclear main underlying cause.  Now
   persistently altered mental status with extreme agitation, continued
   respiratory failure and new pancreatitis.
    #. Altered mental status
 Now off sedation after receiving Fentanyl,
   Versed, Precedex and Propofol (caused pancreatitis). Still on Seroquel.
   She is much more alert, aware this am, but not oriented to person,
   place, time, city, and can barely answer questions, but she is awake
   which is a significant improvement. She is likely delirious from a
   prolonged hospital course.
   --Will get Psych consult today
   --Minimize sedation
   --Frequent reorientation
   #.  Fevers/leukocytosis
WBC ranging between 10 and 12, still with low
   grade fevers of unknown etiology, perhaps from pancreatitis, but her
   abdominal CT without obvious source.    Cardiology does not think that
   she has a purulent pericarditis and are not keen on a diagnostic
   pericardiocentesis.  The pulmonary effusions are not large enough for a
   diagnostic tap.  She has completed a course of ciprofloxacin (14 days
   of quinolones) for pyelonephritis, and as we do not have another source
   of infections, we will stop antibiotics for now, and culture for
   fevers.
   - ID has been consulted, will need f/u
   - F/u cultures and outstanding serologies
   - Off ABx for now
   #. Pancreatitis/ileus
Pancreatitis is most likely secondary to the
   Propofol.  There were no signs of severe pancreatitis or complications
   on CT scan.  Per radiology there is no clear radiologic evidence of
   pancreatitis.  The plan for now is supportive care.  It is difficult
   for us to assess whether the pancreatitis is improving or worsening.
   Ileus improving given increased BM.
   --Advance PO diet now that Dobhoff is out
   #. Anemia
Studies consistent with iron deficiency from anemia of
   chronic disease, and has good retic count, was given 1U PRBC's
   yesterday. No obvious source of bleed.
   - Get f/u Hct this pm
   - guiac stools
   - active type and screen --> sending for one today
   - Transfuse for Hct<21.
   #.  Cardiomyopathy and Pericardial Effusion
Unclear why the pericardial
   effusion is increasing on CXR.  We had been attributing the effusion to
   hypothyroidism, but if it is increasing while he is receiving
   levothyroxine, we may need to search for another etiology. Last echo
   showed that EF had improved to 40% and stable effusion without
   tamponade physiology.  All viral cultures negative to date.
   --Cards does not want to tap the effusion.
   --Will need f/u echo to assess resolution in 4 wks
   #. Hypothyroidism with elevated TPO
On thyroid replacement.  Per
   endocrine, not likely Hashimoto
s encephalopathy.
   --Repeat TFT's still show hypothyroidism, will need to increase
   Levothyroxine
   --F/u with endocrine today about increasing thyroxine
   #. Pyelonephritis
Pulled out perc nephrostomy tube and had it replaced.
   Cultures positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella and has completed a
   course of cipro.  Still has adequate drainage (~500ccs per day) from
   the nephrostomy tube.
   -- Cipro has been d/c'd
   -- Will need reimaging in the future per ID recs to assess for abscess.
   -- Will eventually need stone and drain removed.
    #. DM2
Will need to have BS's monitored with hopefully increasing PO
   intake. Has been in the 100's yesterday.
   --Continue with SSI
   #. FEN:
   --Advanced diet and encourage good PO food and liquids
   - replete lytes PRN
   #. PPX
   - Pneumoboots and SC heparin.
   - H2 blocker for ulcer prophylaxis (famotidine)
   - Doc/senna

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted with cognitive slowing, acute altered mental status (AMS), sepsis from obstructed renal stones post percutaneous nephrostomy, cardiomyopathy likely from hypothyroidism, and respiratory failure likely from multi-focal pneumonia. She has a prolonged hospital course, extreme agitation, continued respiratory failure, and new-onset pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is likely delirious from a prolonged hospital course. She is minimally sedated and will be monitored closely. Psychiatric consultation has been requested.

2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has low-grade fevers and leukocytosis with an unclear etiology. Pancreatitis and pyelonephritis are possible causes. Cultures will be followed, and further investigation is needed.

3. Pancreatitis/ileus: The patient developed pancreatitis possibly secondary to propofol. Supportive care is ongoing, and there is no clear evidence of severe pancreatitis or complications on the CT scan. Ileus is improving with increased bowel movement.

4. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia from chronic disease. She received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday. The cause of the anemia is unclear.

5. Cardiomyopathy and pericardial effusion: The patient has an unclear cause for the increasing pericardial"
