","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to difficulty oxygenating on the ventilator. The patient was sedated and paralyzed with vecuronium, but it was discontinued in the evening. She was started on vancomycin and zosyn for possible infection. The patient received two doses of solumedrol for an inflammatory response.

The patient has a history of hypotension and shock, likely distributive in the setting of IL-2 therapy. She is currently on pressors (NE and phenylephrine) to maintain blood pressure. A transthoracic echo (TTE) was performed, showing a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%. The patient is being monitored closely for infection, and her blood cultures are being checked. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg.

The patient also has non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia, which are likely secondary to NS fluid resuscitation and loose stools prior to ICU admission. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level has dropped from 32.8 on admission to 25, possibly due to acute procedures in the setting of anemia of chronic disease. The patient's platelet count has also decreased from 448 on admission"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy.
- The patient required intubation, sedation, and both levo and neo for blood pressure support. Paralysis was required due to difficulty oxygenating on the ventilator, but vecuronium was discontinued in the evening.
- An echo showed an ejection fraction of 50% with hypokinesis of the low posterior wall. Troponin levels were elevated at 0.27 and then 0.21. Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was given aspirin.
- The patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn for possible infection. Solumedrol 125mg IV was given twice, and the oncology recommendations were to use as little steroids as possible, but may repeat the same dose daily if the patient's condition worsens.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The patient received multiple infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, vecuronium, and ranitidine.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 121/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

   resuscitation and loose stools prior to ICU admission
   - monitor chem-7
   - could alternate NS w LR as needed
   - closely monitor acid-base status
   .
   # Anemia: Hct baseline32.8 on admission, dropped to 25 likely in [**3-5**]
   acute procedures (line placement) in the setting of anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - check Hct [**Hospital1 **] until stable
   - maintain active T&S.
   - transfuse for Hct < 24 (onc pt).
   # Thrombocytopenia: PLT 448 on admission, now 73. Unclear etiology
   chemo vs HIT vs other.
   - closely monitor plts
   - transfuse if PLT < 20
   - check HIT ab (PF-4 ab)
   - monitor fibrinogen for DIC
   - off heparin products
   # Metastatic melanoma: received IL-2 therapy w complications.
   - Holding further IL-2 for now.
   - Further management per primary oncology team.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. 

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is diagnosed with ARDS, possibly secondary to an underlying pneumonia (PNA). The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation while weaning the respiratory rate, FiO2, and PEEP as tolerated. Transitioning to pressure support (PS) is planned for Sunday or Monday. Steroids will be given to manage the inflammatory response, and daily chest X-rays will be performed. Infection control measures and monitoring of input/output (I/O) status are also important.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is likely experiencing distributive shock, possibly due to IL-2 therapy. It is unclear if there is an infection or sepsis present. The patient has received vasopressors (NE and phenylephrine) and will continue to receive them. Vancomycin and zosyn have been started for possible infection, and NS boluses will be given as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Blood cultures are to be checked, and the patient's condition will be closely monitored.

3. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis/Hypernatrem"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient received IL-2 chemotherapy, which may have caused systemic capillary leak and possible pneumonia. His vital signs show low blood pressure and an elevated heart rate. Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II and has a history of malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure could progress to ARDS due to underlying pneumonia or IL-2 therapy.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of infection indicators (elevated white blood cell count, positive sputum culture), there is a risk of developing sepsis, especially considering the patient's immunocompromised state.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may lead to bleeding complications if not closely monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base imbalance needs to be carefully monitored, as it can affect organ function and overall prognosis.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate ongoing hypoperfusion and shock, requiring prompt intervention.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's blood glucose"

   Dropped likely in [**3-5**] acute procedures (line placement) in the setting
   of anemia of chronic disease.
   - check Hct daily
   - maintain active T&S.
   - transfuse for Hct < 24 (onc pt).

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 56 year old female with metastatic melanoma
   who developed respiratory failure and shock after IL2
   therapy. Overnight peep decreased to 8.   Bolused for low u/o with good
   response.

   weaning/extubation though at this time still requiring significant vent
   support and has sig v/q mismatch which is sensitive to
   movement/positional change.  She also remains very sedated further
   impacting ability to wean.  Will decrease sedation, may need to change
   to short-acting [**Doctor Last Name **] (propofol or precidex). Decrease peep following

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema from IL-2 therapy. Other possibilities include pneumonia or ARDS.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient initially presented with hypotension and shock, likely distributive in nature due to IL-2 therapy. The patient required vasopressor support with norepinephrine and phenylephrine. 

3. Fever: The patient has an unclear etiology fever, which may be attributed to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). It is important to monitor the fever curve and continue appropriate antibiotic coverage.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a nadir of 71 platelets. The cause of this is unclear, with possibilities including chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or other factors. It is important to closely monitor platelet levels and consider transfusion if below a certain threshold.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to sodium fluid resuscitation and previous loose stools. A free water deficit of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to systemic capillary leak from IL-2 therapy with possible overlying pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and management of respiratory support are necessary.

2. Hypotension/Shock: The patient likely had distributive shock on admission due to IL-2 therapy. However, the patient has improved and is currently stable without the need for pressors. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is important.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level likely due to NS fluid resuscitation and loose stools prior to ICU admission. Free water deficit is estimated to be 2-3L. Management involves administering D5W and free water flushes through the tube feed, monitoring chem-7, using LR instead of NS, and closely monitoring acid-base status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Initial laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The patient is febrile with unclear etiology, likely hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is receiving empiric treatment for HAP with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is suspected in the setting of systemic capillary leak from IL-2 therapy, possibly with an underlying pneumonia. Sedation is being weaned, and transitioning from midazolam/fentanyl to propofol/fentanyl is planned. Hypotension and shock were initially present but have improved with pressor support. The patient has hypernatremia likely due to NS fluid resuscitation and loose stools prior to ICU admission. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present but their causes are unclear. Metastatic melanoma and diabetes mellitus type II are also noted. Further management will involve close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who presented for IL-2 therapy and subsequently developed respiratory failure and shock. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current condition is improving, with reduced vasopressor support and weaning of FiO2. However, she remains hypotensive and in respiratory distress. The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral diffuse infiltrates, which could indicate ARDS or pneumonia. Her lab results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and possible infection. The patient's code status is full code, and a family meeting has been scheduled to discuss the overall plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's bilateral diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray, along with her respiratory distress and hypoxemia, raise concerns for ARDS. If confirmed, this can lead to severe respiratory compromise and potentially require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and production of purulent secretions may indicate an underlying pneumonia. This would require appropriate antibiotic therapy and could contribute to the respiratory distress.
3. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient's underlying malignancy puts her at risk for further complications related to cancer progression or treatment-related toxicities.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially during invasive"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (132 bpm), elevated blood pressure (160/77 mmHg), increased respiratory rate (27 breaths per minute), and a SpO2 level of 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range (36.4°C).

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 77 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.8 mmol/L. The blood culture results show the presence of Gram-negative rods (GNR).

The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic capillary leak from IL-2 therapy, possible underlying pneumonia, anemia of chronic disease, thrombocytopenia likely due to chemotherapy, and hypotension/shock that has since resolved.

The plan of care includes continuing mechanical ventilation, weaning respiratory support as tolerated, administering antibiotics for GNR hospital-acquired pneumonia, closely monitoring the patient's intake and output, performing daily chest X-rays, holding IL-2 therapy, and further management per primary oncology team.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who was admitted for IL-2 therapy. She developed acute respiratory failure and shock post-therapy. Despite resolving shock, the patient remains in respiratory failure. She is intubated and sedated, with increased thick secretions from the endotracheal tube. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 98.9°F, pulse rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 106/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on PS 10/5.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray and increased thick secretions suggest a superimposed ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient will continue to be maintained on mechanical ventilation, and antibiotics will be continued.
2. Shock: The patient's shock has resolved, but it is important to continue monitoring pressures and perfusion endpoints to ensure stable hemodynamics.
3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but it is important to follow up with culture results and continue antibiotics for now.
4. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient's underlying condition of metastatic melanoma requires further management per primary oncology team.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable and trending upwards. Close monitoring of platelets is necessary, and transfusion should be considered"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma, admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure due to IL-2 chemotherapy.
- The patient was intubated on [**7-13**] and received methylprednisolone for an inflammatory response.
- Current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/38 mmHg to 168/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- Physical examination reveals the patient is intubated, sedated, and responds minimally to voice. Chest sounds are clear bilaterally, abdomen is soft with no abnormal bowel sounds, and extremities are warm with no edema.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.0 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 179 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances.
- Imaging studies reveal no significant findings.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possible pneumonia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and hypotension/shock.
- The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam), sedatives (Propofol), analgesics (Fentanyl), and others.
- The plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, weaning respiratory support as tolerated, administering appropriate antibiotics, closely monitoring fluid balance and blood gases, performing daily chest X-rays, and holding IL-2 therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is experiencing severe respiratory distress and requires mechanical ventilation. ARDS is characterized by diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxemia, and bilateral chest pain.
2. Possible Pneumonia: The presence of fever and leukocytosis suggests a possible underlying infection, which could be bacterial in nature. Close monitoring of sputum cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy is necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Daily monitoring of hemoglobin levels and blood transfusion may be required.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is below normal, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet levels"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS, likely secondary to systemic capillary leak from IL-2 therapy with possible underlying pneumonia. She has been treated with methylprednisolone for an inflammatory response.

The patient has anemia with a baseline Hct of 32.8 on admission, which has stabilized between 23-24. This could be due to acute procedures and anemia of chronic disease. Dilution with IV fluids may also contribute to the anemia. The plan is to check Hct daily, maintain active T&S, and transfuse for Hct < 22.

Thrombocytopenia is suspected to be related to recent chemotherapy, with a nadir of 71 and now uptrending. The plan is to closely monitor platelets and transfuse if platelets < 20.

Hypernatremia is likely due to dehydration and NS fluid resuscitation, with a peak of 151 and now at 143. The plan is to monitor chem-7 daily and flush tube feeds as needed.

The patient's metastatic melanoma is being managed with IL-2 therapy, but further IL-2 is being held for now. Additional dose of steroids and further management will be determined by the primary oncology team.

The patient also has diabetes mell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma, who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. The patient received methylprednisolone for the inflammatory response and was intubated on [**7-13**]. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for GNR HAP. The plan is to wean propofol/fentanyl, transition to precedex, perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and possibly extubate today. The patient has multiple medical complications including anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, metastatic melanoma, DM II, and hypotension/shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped from 32.8 on admission to 23-24, likely due to acute procedures, anemia of chronic disease, and dilution with IVF. Close monitoring of Hct is necessary, and transfusion may be required for Hct < 22.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's PLT was 448 on admission and nadired at 71 before uptrending. Close monitoring of plts is needed, and transfusion may be required if PLT < 20.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels peaked at 151 and are currently at 143. Monitoring of"

   following modifications/emphasis:
   56 year old female with metastatic melanoma who presented for IL-2
   therapy and post-therapy developed respiratory failure and shock. Shock
   has subsequently resolved although patient remains in respiratory
   failure.

   1) Acute Respiratory Failure:
   a. Most likely ARDS/non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema from IL-2. Other
   possibilities include pneumonia/ARDS. Today, clinically much improved
   and tolerating PS 5/5 and CXR much improved.
   b. Will continue antibiotics
   c. Change to precedex to decrease agitation as she seems to be able to
   extubate from a pulmonary standpoint more likely limited

   5) Anemia
   6) DM
   7) Full Code
   Addendum:  Pt was doing well on PS 5/5 and following commands so
   decision made to extubate the patient.  Patient extubated but did not
   do well thus requiring re-intubation for respiratory distress/failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who presented for IL-2 therapy. She developed acute respiratory failure and shock, which have since resolved. The patient remains in respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note include:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS, which is a severe form of lung injury characterized by widespread inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is at risk for HAP due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of mechanical ventilation. The presence of Gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum culture indicates a potential bacterial infection.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped from 448 to 71, indicating thrombocytopenia. This could be due to chemotherapy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped from 32.8 to 23.2, indicating anemia. This may be due to blood loss during procedures, anemia of chronic disease, or dilutional effects from intravenous fluids.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who has been admitted to the ICU for IL-2 therapy-induced SIRS, shock, and respiratory failure. The patient failed extubation two days ago and remains intubated.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/65 mmHg to 175/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on a ventilator with settings including a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.5 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 179 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 107 mEq/L, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 268 mg/dL, and altered mental status. The patient has been placed on an insulin drip to manage hyperglycemia.

The patient's chest X-ray shows improving infiltrates, suggesting improvement in pneumonia. The patient is expected to be weaned off the ventilator soon and continue receiving antibiotics.

The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status, respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, and shock. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 133/65 mmHg to 175/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood cultures were drawn from both arterial and central lines, and urine culture was also obtained. The patient is receiving multiple medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, fentanyl, midazolam, insulin, and haloperidol. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.47. The patient's physical examination findings are mostly unremarkable except for the absence of peripheral pulses and skin assessment. The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray taken on 07/18/218"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, systemic capillary leak syndrome from IL-2 therapy, and an underlying infection (HAP) possibly caused by MRSA and Enterobacter cloacae. She is receiving Vancomycin, Piperacillin-Tazobactam, and Ciprofloxacin for the infection. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance, wean off sedatives, and possibly extubate her tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a confirmed infection (HAP) and is already receiving antibiotics. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any worsening of infection or development of new infections.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is likely due to the systemic capillary leak syndrome from IL-2 therapy and the underlying infection. Monitoring of respiratory parameters and oxygenation is crucial to assess the progression or improvement of ARDS.

3. Fluid Balance: The patient needs to achieve a negative fluid balance. Close monitoring of intake and output will be necessary to ensure this goal is met. Excessive fluid administration can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening of ARDS.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure due to ARDS and possible underlying infection (HAP). She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adherence to proper hygiene practices will be essential to prevent this complication.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has multiple central lines in place, which can increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection. Regular assessment of line sites and prompt treatment of any suspected infections is crucial.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability due to critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as enoxaparin should be continued to reduce the risk of thrombosis.
4. Delirium: Prolonged ICU stay and sedation can lead to delirium. Frequent reassessment of mental status and early mobilization when appropriate are important to prevent delirium.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to failed extubation on [**7-19**]. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, fever, anemia, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and possible infection (HAP or UTI). She is receiving Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for HAP, and her goals include achieving a negative fluid balance, weaning from sedation, and possible extubation. The patient's oncology management is being discussed with the primary team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has signs of possible infection, including fever and hypotension. She is already receiving treatment for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection is crucial.
2. Fluid Balance: The patient's goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance. Close monitoring of her fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent fluid overload or under-resuscitation.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped from 32.8 on admission to 23-24. This could be due to anemia of chronic disease or dilution from IVF. Regular monitoring of Hct and active blood testing is recommended. Transfusion should be considered when Hct < 22.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient had hypernatremia likely due to dehydration and NS fluid resuscitation. Monitoring of electrolytes is important to prevent further imbalances.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's PLT nadired at 71 but has since resolved. Close monitoring of platelets is recommended, and transfusion should be considered if PLT < 20.
6. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient's metastatic melanoma requires further management by the primary oncology team. Communication with the team and consideration of additional dose of steroids should be discussed.
7. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient is on sliding scale insulin for glycemic control. Monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
8. ICU Care: The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. These aspects should be closely monitored and managed appropriately."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. She has been intubated twice, initially on [**7-13**] and then reintubated on [**7-19**] due to failed extubation. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is diagnosed with ARDS in the setting of systemic capillary leak from IL-2 therapy. She has an underlying infection with Enterobacter/MRSA HAP, for which she is receiving antibiotics.
- Fever and Hypotension: The patient has persistent fever and hypotension, which may be due to infection (HAP or UTI) or other causes. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
- Anemia: The patient's Hct level has dropped from 32.8 on admission to 23-24, likely due to acute procedures, anemia of chronic disease, and IVF. Close monitoring of Hct and transfusion if necessary are planned.
- Hypernatremia: The patient had a high sodium level of 151 but has improved to 143. Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance is important.
- Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count was initially low but has resolved. Close monitoring of platelets is recommended"

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. They are receiving IV fluids and antibiotics for an unknown origin fever. The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 85/38 mmHg and tachycardia with a heart rate of 89 bpm. Respiratory support is being provided through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. Oxygenation is maintained with an FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a slightly alkalotic pH of 7.47, high oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) of 360, and adequate ventilation with a respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.5 K/uL, and an increased hematocrit (Hct) level of 27.5%. The platelet count (Plt) is within normal range at 96 K/uL. Renal function tests reveal a decreased creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/dL. Liver function tests show normal values for AST and ALT, while electrolyte levels are within normal limits except for a slightly low potassium level (K"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure in the setting of IL-2 chemotherapy. She received methylprednisolone treatment and was intubated on [**7-13**] after failed extubation on [**7-19**]. The patient is now reintubated and the plan is to extubate her today when her daughter arrives. She will continue to receive [**Name (NI) 2601**]/Zosyn/Cipro x 14 days (6/12 [**7-26**]) for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance, nebs as needed, and follow-up chest X-rays. 

The patient is also being evaluated for fever and hypotension, which could be due to infection such as HAP, urinary tract infection (UTI), or other causes. The same antibiotic regimen will be continued for HAP. A pancreatic cancer (pan-cx) will be done, and Tylenol will be administered for fever. 

The patient's Hct has dropped from 32.8 on admission to 23-24, likely due to acute procedures and anemia of chronic disease, as well as dilution with intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient's sodium levels were high at 151 but have now stabilized at 143, likely due to [**3-5**] dehydration and normal saline fluid resuscitation. 

The patient's platelet count was initially low at 71 but has now resolved. Close monitoring of platelet levels will be continued, and transfusion will be considered if the platelet count falls below 20. 

The patient's metastatic melanoma requires further management by the primary oncology team, and the decision to hold further IL-2 therapy will be discussed. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II will be managed with sliding scale insulin. 

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (multi-lumen and arterial line), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is still pending."

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with metastatic melanoma, presenting with capillary leak syndrome and respiratory failure. The patient was extubated yesterday and remains extubated. He is on minimal FiO2 requirement and offers no new complaints. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 108/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of hyperglycemia but no history of thyroid disease. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvement in acute respiratory failure, which was attributed to pulmonary edema secondary to IL-2 therapy. The patient also has metastatic melanoma and completed antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination. Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and stable kidney function. 

The patient's assessment includes metastatic melanoma, resolved acute respiratory failure, resolving pneumonia, stable anemia, stable thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus. The plan includes monitoring glucose levels and maintaining glucose below 150, continuing ICU care, and planning for further therapy for metastatic melanoma. The patient's disposition is to be transferred to the floor."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has a history of metastatic melanoma and was admitted with capillary leak syndrome and respiratory failure. They have improved and now present with minimal FiO2 requirement and remain extubated. The patient has no new complaints.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, which is completing its course of treatment. There are no immediate plans for further therapy for metastatic melanoma. Thrombocytopenia is stable, anemia is present but not specified in severity, and diabetes mellitus (DM) is also noted.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control measures, and has multiple lines including an arterial line. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and they are expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient has been treated for pneumonia, indicating a previous infection. Continued monitoring for any signs of infection is important.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of the platelet count and any signs of bleeding is necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness,"
