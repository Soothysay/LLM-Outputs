","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and a recently diagnosed mediastinal mass. He presented with fevers, cough, and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin and levofloxacin. He is currently on azithromycin and ceftriaxone, and his antibiotic regimen is being adjusted. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 100s-120s on atenolol and lisinopril. He is receiving aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and has had a central line placed. The patient's renal function is compromised, with an elevated creatinine level. He also has dysphagia due to the mediastinal mass, which is causing severe swallowing difficulties. The patient's diabetes medication is being held, and he is on anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's known infection and fevers, there is a concern for sepsis, especially considering his compromised immune system due to frequent hospital visits and instrumentalizations.
2. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure is low, which could be due to severe hypovolemia or sepsis. Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation is being continued to maintain adequate"

   69yoM with HTN, DM2, AFib, and mediastinal mass with Bx concerning for
   small cell lung ca, admitted for dyphagia, fevers, cough, and PNA.
   1. Mediastinal mass--Heme/Onc has been consulted and is currently
   discussing with Pathology the Bx from the mediastinal mass and should
   get back to us at some point today. Also recommended CT abd/pelvis with
   contrast to finish staging workup but given current Cr will have to do
   without contrast, and can likely do CT head at same time to eval for
   mets. Getting definitive Dx ASAP would be best as pt symptomatic from
   mass with dysphagia and would be good to start early XRT vs chemo for
   symptom relief. Had echo yesterday showing no hemodynamic compromise of
   the mass.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation, and a mediastinal mass suspected to be small cell lung cancer. He was admitted for dysphagia, fevers, cough, and pneumonia.
- The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis without organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and cancer (malignant neoplasm).
- Heme/Onc has been consulted regarding the mediastinal mass and is discussing with Pathology.
- A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is needed for staging workup, but the patient's creatinine level is high, so contrast cannot be used. A CT head can also be done at the same time to evaluate for metastasis.
- The patient's dysphagia is due to the mass compressing the esophagus.
- The patient received a total of 8.5 liters of intravenous fluids since admission. His Foley catheter is draining clear, yellow urine.
- The patient has intermittent complaints of difficulty breathing and dyspnea on exertion with oxygen saturation dropping to the high 80s to low 90s. Lung sounds are clear with occasional wheezes.
- The patient received 40mg of lasix intravenously and responded well, reporting easier breathing after the medication.
- The plan is to continue diuresis as tolerated by the patient, monitor blood pressure, urine output"

   Had echo yesterday showing no hemodynamic compromise of the mass.
   --F/u with Heme Onc, will appreciate their recs. Spoke with fellow
   yesterday who stated they would also contact [**Name (NI) 119**] Onc.
   --Will need to order CT head/abd/pelvis without contrast for further
   staging
   --Will do trial of lying flat on his back and adjustment of FiO2 and
   wearing a mask before sending him to CT to ensure he won
t get SOB
   during CT.
   --Albuterol prn for SOB, which is in large part due to the mass itself
   2. AFib
Was being anticoagulated but had Coumadin d/c
d yesterday due
   to possible further need for re-imaging. Pt with known Dx of AFib and
   also is not symptomatic, so likely won
t benefit from cardioversion.
   --Continue Propafenone and Dilt gtt and will try to convert pt to PO
   Dilt as tolerated.
   --For now, will hold off any giving any anticoagulation as we do not
   know what further procedures the pt will need. Will f/u with Heme Onc
   about necessity of re-Bx of mass. If it will be for extended amt of
   time would consider Heparin gtt for bridging but with only risk factor
   of DM2 and age would have low daily risk of thromboembolism per day, so
   overall can keep off anticoagulation.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Mediastinal Mass: The patient has a mediastinal mass that is concerning for small cell lung cancer. Further diagnostic workup, such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, is needed for staging. A consultation with hematology/oncology has been requested to discuss the biopsy results and determine the appropriate treatment plan.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has known atrial fibrillation and is currently not being anticoagulated due to the need for further imaging. Cardioversion is not likely to be beneficial as the patient is asymptomatic. Propafenone and diltiazem will be continued, and the patient will be monitored for symptoms of AFib.

3. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient continues on empiric antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Azithromycin) for pneumonia. There are no positive sputum or blood cultures. The white blood cell count is elevated but stable. A repeat chest X-ray has been ordered to assess the progression of the pneumonia.

   69yoM with HTN, DM2, AFib, and mediastinal mass with Bx concerning for
   small cell lung ca, admitted for dyphagia, fevers, cough, and PNA.
   1. Mediastinal mass--Heme/Onc has been consulted and is currently
   discussing with Pathology the Bx from the mediastinal mass and should
   get back to us at some point today. Also recommended CT abd/pelvis with
   contrast to finish staging workup but given current Cr will have to do
   without contrast, and can likely do CT head at same time to eval for
   mets. Getting definitive Dx ASAP would be best as pt symptomatic from
   mass with dysphagia and would be good to start early XRT vs chemo for
   symptom relief. Had echo yesterday showing no hemodynamic compromise of
   the mass.
   --F/u with Heme Onc, will appreciate their recs. Spoke with fellow

   - Heme onc would prefer to have another biopsy as his first biopsy
   final read says ""Although the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings
   are suspicious for small cell lung carcinoma, the radiologic and
   clinical presentation are somewhat unusual. Further workup with
   additional tissue biopsies are recommended.""
   - Interventional pulmonology will do a bronchoscopic biopsy tomorrow.
   - Rad onc recs: after tissue obtained, could get radiation as soon as
   Thursday.
   - CT not done as patient uncomfortable lying flat and requested it be

His increasing difficulty with oral medications may require switching to intravenous diltiazem for now. Propafenone may also need to be replaced. For now, anticoagulation is being actively reversed for the biopsy, and reassessment will be done based on the chemotherapy plan. Temporary SC heparin may be used.
3. Pneumonia - The patient is afebrile but still coughing. It is unclear whether his symptoms are related to his mediastinal mass or pneumonia. He continues on empiric Cef"

   small cell lung ca, admitted for dyphagia, fevers, cough, and PNA.
   1. Mediastinal mass--Heme/Onc needs more tissue to proceed with
   directed management, and needs a CT abdomen/pelvis and head for further
   staging.  Can repeat chest CT at the same time to assess for evolution
   and cause of increased shortness of breath when lying flat. After
   biopsy should go to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for XRT and oncology management.
   - IP will be doing a bronchoscopic biopsy.  We are giving Vit K and FFP
   with aim of INR<1.5 for procedure.  If the patient cannot tolerate
   lying flat he may need to be intubated.
   - F/u with Heme Onc and Rad Onc.
   - CT head/abd/pelvis without contrast for further staging
   - If patient does need intubation, plan should be discussed with him
   first in case he needs to remain intubated
   - Albuterol prn for SOB, which is in large part due to the mass itself
   2. AFib

   --Continue Propafenone and Dilt gtt.  He has increasing difficulty with
   PO medications, so we will continue with IV dilt for now.
   --For now, we are actively reversing anticoagulation for biopsy.  Can
   reassess need for anticoagulation based on chemotherapy plan.  For now
   just SC heparin.
   3. PNA
Patient now afebrile though coughing continues.  It is unclear
   whether his symptoms are related to his mediastinal mass or a
   pneumonia.  Continues on empiric Ceftriaxone day 3, Vanc day 4, and
   Azithromycin day 3. No positive sputum or BCx

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with complaints of shortness of breath and hemodynamic instability. The patient has a history of cancer, but the type of cancer is not specified in the note. There are conflicting findings between the first biopsy and radiologic presentation, leading to a recommendation for additional tissue biopsies. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,438 mL since midnight. The patient has a high white blood cell count, elevated lactate level, and elevated troponin level. The patient's renal function is impaired with an increased creatinine level. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation and is being considered for anticoagulation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Malignant neoplasm: The patient's history of cancer and the need for additional tissue biopsies suggest a possible malignant neoplasm. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate level, and hemodynamic instability indicate the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring and prompt management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired renal function. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting fluid and medication management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and recently diagnosed small cell lung carcinoma. The patient was transferred from the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for radiation therapy (XRT) in the morning.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC): The patient had a Y-stent placed for difficulty breathing and a transbronchial biopsy was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of SCLC. Surgery is not indicated at this time, and the plan is for mapping and palliative XRT while the patient is intubated. Follow-up with hematology/oncology and radiation oncology recommendations is needed, as well as follow-up CT results for staging.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's symptoms of fever and cough are likely due to post-obstructive PNA from SCLC. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin will be continued. The patient should continue using PRN albuterol and atrovent inhalers. Attempt to wean antibiotics pending the results of sputum culture, and a bronchoscopy will be done. Blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine culture will also be obtained.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (A-fib): Anticoagulation was held for the procedure (Y-stent) but will be"

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and recently diagnosed small cell lung carcinoma. He was transferred from the MICU for radiation therapy. The patient has been intubated and sedated since 11:01 PM on 12/7. He is currently receiving invasive ventilation and is planned for mapping and palliative radiation therapy in the morning. 

Medical Complications:
1. Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC): The patient has a recent diagnosis of SCLC. Surgical resection is not a role due to the positive biopsy result. The plan is for palliative radiation therapy and further oncology recommendations.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient presents with symptoms of fever and cough, which are likely due to community-acquired and post-obstructive PNA caused by SCLC. Treatment includes Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, and Flagyl for anaerobic coverage. Inhalers for albuterol and atrovent are also provided. The sputum culture will be followed up.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (A-fib): Anticoagulation is held for the procedure but will be restarted if necessary. Rhythm control is managed with propafenone and diltiazem.
4. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia due to a large posterior mediastinal mass"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma, preparing for radiation therapy mapping and administration. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. A tracheal Y-stent has been placed by Interventional Pulmonology. The patient has pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and preserved renal function. The patient's nutritional support is pending evaluation for extubation, as dysphagia is attributed to a mediastinal mass. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further deterioration or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia, and the risk of worsening infection or developing new infections while on mechanical ventilation exists.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which needs to be controlled and monitored for potential complications like thromboembolism.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus requires careful monitoring and management of blood glucose levels, especially while NPO.
5. Renal Function: Although the patient's renal function is currently preserved, it should be closely monitored due to the risk of acute kidney injury.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and recently diagnosed small cell lung carcinoma. The patient was transferred from the MICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and has undergone his first session yesterday.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Dyspnea improved after Y-stent placement
- Productive cough and fevers concerning for post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) from SCLC
- A-fib with controlled rhythm using propafenone
- Large posterior mediastinal mass compressing the esophagus, causing dysphagia
- Diabetes managed with insulin sliding scale (ISS) and holding home metformin
- Gout treated with allopurinol at a renally adjusted dose

The patient's vital signs show:
- Tcurrent: 37.2 C (99 F)
- HR: 122 bpm
- BP: 127/67 mmHg
- RR: 32 breaths per minute
- SpO2: 95%
- Heart rhythm: Atrial Fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results indicate:
- WBC: 12.2 - 9.4 K/uL
- Hct: 30.4 - 28.4%
- Plt: 179 - 238 K/uL
- Cr: 1.2 - 1.1 mg/dL
- Glucose: 118 - 136 mg/dL
- Other labs: Within normal range or not significantly abnormal

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of lung cancer, respiratory infections, and the use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on anticoagulation. There is a risk of thromboembolic events or bleeding complications due to the anticoagulant therapy.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The large mediastinal mass is compressing the esophagus, leading to dysphagia. There is a risk of aspiration pneumonia or other gastrointestinal disturbances.
4. Infection-related complications: The patient has a productive cough and fevers, indicating a possible post-obstructive pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of new infections.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, cardiac rhythm, gastrointestinal function, and infection parameters to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   69 year-old gentleman w/ HTN, DM, Afib and recently diagnosed small
   cell lung carcinoma, transferred from MICU for XRT.
   1. SCLC- s/p Y-stent for difficulty breathing, s/p transbronch bx.
   since + bx, no role for surgery.
   - plan for mapping & palliative XRT in AM while intubated.
   - f/u heme/onc and rad-onc recs
   - f/u final CT results for staging
   -SW c/s for coping w/ new dx once extubated
   2. PNA- His symptoms of fever and cough are likely due to a combination
   of community-acquired and post-obstructive PNA from SCLC.
   - will continue treat with Vanc, CTX and, Azithromycin
   - Add flagyl for anaerobic coverage given concern for post-obstructive
   PNA
   - continue PRN albuterol and atrovent inhalers
   - f/u sputum cx (endotracheal)
   - attempt to wean abx pending results of sputum cx (would d/c Vanc)
   - BCx, UCx, U/A in AM
   3. A-fib: anticoagulation held for procedure (y-stent) will check w/
   heme/onc and rad/onc if further procedures warranted, if not will need
   to restart anticoagulation.
   - Rhythm controlled w/ propafenone.
   - On diltiazem drip since yesterday for a-fib w/ [**Last Name (LF) 1427**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue for
   now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and recently diagnosed small cell lung carcinoma. He was admitted to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) due to a large mediastinal mass causing dyspnea. The patient underwent a Y-stent procedure and received his first XRT session yesterday. He has been extubated post-XRT and is currently on supplemental oxygen via a face tent. His vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (122 bpm) and blood pressure (127/67 mmHg). He is still experiencing a productive cough but has improved dyspnea. The patient complains of mild chest soreness and palpitations. Allergies: No known drug allergies. Medications: Diltiazem infusion at 5 mg/hour, Carafate (sucralfate), Heparin sodium (prophylaxis), Pantoprazole (Protonix), Lorazepam (Ativan). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC): The patient has recently been diagnosed with SCLC, which is an aggressive form of lung cancer. Complications may arise from the progression of the disease, such as metastasis or respiratory distress due to the tumor obstructing the airways.
2. Post-obstructive Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's productive cough and fevers could indicate a post-ob"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male diagnosed with small cell lung carcinoma, preparing for radiation therapy mapping and administration.
- The patient experienced respiratory distress and atrial fibrillation.
- He was extubated last night and remains extubated.
- The patient has a hoarse voice, cough, and is up in a chair.
- He is on a Diltiazem drip for heart rate control.
- The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected pneumonia.
- He has a large mediastinal mass consistent with small cell lung cancer, and radiation therapy is planned.
- The patient's condition includes pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and nutritional support needed due to dysphagia caused by the mediastinal mass.
- His fluid balance and renal function need to be monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced respiratory distress and was previously intubated. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has post-obstructive pneumonia, which can worsen if not treated effectively with appropriate antibiotics.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing rapid ventricular response and requires careful management of heart rate and rhythm.
4. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be monitored and managed, especially while he is NPO.
5. Nutritional support: Due to the mediastinal mass causing dysph"
