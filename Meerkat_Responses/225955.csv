   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: likely combination of sepsis from underlying SBP now with
   aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical pneumonitis given acuity of onset,
   now requiring 2 pressors (phenylephrine and vasopressin) and
   contribution of hemorrhagic component with continued falling HCT
s and
   rising INR in setting of frequent PRBC
s and FFP transfusions.
   -  continue vancomycin, meropenum, flagyl for broad spectrum coverage
   of pneumonia and SBP flora
 consider stopping ciprofloxacin as [**Last Name (un) 614**]
   covers gram neg. and pseudomonas
   -  continue PRBC / FFP transfusions for falling HCT and rising INR
   -  trend fibrinogen and transfuse cryoprecipitate if < 125
   -  follow daily CXR and ABG
   ##. Respiratory failure: likely result of aspiration pneumonia vs.
   chemical pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   - continue ARDs ventilation settings
   - follow with serial ABG
   - continue sedation with Fentayl only, Midazolam discontinued do to
   hepatic dysfunction
   ##. GI bleed: patient with episode of hemoptysis on the floor and hx of
   GI bleed via gastropathy from portal HTN and notable dark red blood and
   clots aspirated by OG tube, now s/p EGD which showed oozing gastropathy
   and now falling HCT and rising INR in setting of multiple transfusions
   overnight.
   - continue PRBC / FFP transfusions for falling HCT and rising INR
   - transfuse cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen < 125
   - continue pressor support to sustain urine output
   ##. ST depressions: continued rising TN
s in the setting of ST
   depressions c/w NSTEMI with h/o of pos. stress test several months
   prior
 however, patient is not a candidate for interventions given
   substantial bleeding risk.  Echo demonstrated LV infero-lateral
   akinesis c/w infarction with increased level of heart dysfunction
   compared to prior.  This most likely is the result of demand ischemia
   in the setting of shock and hemorrhage.
   -
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - continue PRBC and FFP transfusion with pressor support
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension from his shock.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past with near
   2.0 on this admission.
   - continue to trend Cr
 stable
   - continue pressor support to improve renal perfusion
   - FeNa 1.73 suggests not entirely pre-renal in etiology with likely
   intrinsic component
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage
   - continue IAP
s to ensure no abdominal compartment syndrome

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history including hepatic sarcoidosis, ascites, cirrhosis, grade I varices, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and recent hospitalization for melena requiring PRBC transfusion. The patient presented for TIPS evaluation and was noted to develop spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), leading to admission to the MICU for continued desaturations with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient underwent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) scope, which revealed oozing gastropathy. Recommendations included reversing INR with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and adding carafate 1g QID. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild regional left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral akinesis. Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and mild pulmonary aortic (PA) systolic hypertension were also observed. Comparison with a prior study on 5-27 indicated lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and increased degree of valvular regurgitation. Additionally, LV cavity dilation was noted.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) continues to trend down from 26.9% to 24.6% to 21.9%, despite multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfusion."

   GI bleed via gastropathy from portal HTN and notable dark red blood and
   clots aspirated by OG tube, now s/p EGD which showed oozing gastropathy
   and now falling HCT and rising INR in setting of multiple transfusions
   overnight.
   - continue PRBC / FFP transfusions for falling HCT and rising INR
   - transfuse cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen < 125
   - continue pressor support to sustain urine output
   - re-consult hepatology for consideration of TIPS
   ##. Shock: likely due mostly to hemorrhagic shock. Possible component
   of sepsis from underlying SBP now with aspiration pneumonia vs.
   chemical pneumonitis given acuity of onset, now requiring 2 pressors
   (phenylephrine and vasopressin)
   -  continue vancomycin, meropenum, flagyl, cipro for broad spectrum
   coverage of pneumonia and SBP flora
   -  continue PRBC / FFP / Cryo transfusions as mentioned above
   -  d/w hepatology TIPS as definitive treatment and establish endpoint
   -  follow daily CXR and ABG
   -  IV PPI drip, will defer octerotide ggt as on vasopressin
   ##. Respiratory failure: likely result of aspiration pneumonia vs.
   chemical pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation, along
   with collapse of lung.
   - d/w family potential bronch today for possible right lung collapse
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   - continue ARDs ventilation settings
   - follow with serial ABG
   - continue sedation with Fentayl only, Midazolam discontinued for
   hepatic dysfunction

s in the setting of ST
   depressions c/w NSTEMI with h/o of pos. stress test several months
   prior
 however, patient is not a candidate for interventions given
   substantial bleeding risk.  Echo demonstrated LV infero-lateral
   akinesis c/w infarction with increased level of heart dysfunction
   compared to prior.  This most likely is the result of demand ischemia
   in the setting of shock and hemorrhage.
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - continue PRBC and FFP transfusion with pressor support for improved
   myocardial perfusion
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension from his shock.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past with near

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, ascites, cirrhosis, grade I varices, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and previous hospitalization for melena requiring PRBC transfusion. He presented for TIPS evaluation but developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient has ongoing oozing gastropathy from portal hypertension, which was confirmed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He is experiencing a falling hematocrit (HCT) and rising international normalized ratio (INR), indicating significant blood loss and coagulopathy. 

He is also in shock, likely due to hemorrhagic shock with possible sepsis from underlying SBP and aspiration pneumonia. The patient requires two pressors (phenylephrine and vasopressin) to maintain blood pressure and urine output.

Additionally, the patient has respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia or chemical pneumonitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient is being ventilated with assisted control mode ventilation (ACMV).

The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to hypotension from shock. His renal function is trending up, but he still requires pressor support to improve renal perfusion.

Other issues include hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HOT) with a history of hepatic"

   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: Like due to sepsis with possible confounding hypovolemia
   with suspect source of sepsis likely aspiration PNA versus chemical
   pneumonitis given pt's poor gag reflex and acuity of onset. Other
   causes to consider include possible flash pulmonary edema, pt received
   IV Furosemide 40mg x 1 prior to transfer to the floor. Pulmonary
   Embolism is also something to consider  given appearance on x-ray
   though suspect aspiration as more likely cause. Given pt's poor
   respiratory state an increase in hypercapnea pt was intubated.
   - pt already on Flagyl, will continue for aspiration PNA coverage
   - will check ABG following intubation
   - will check CXR portable for ETT placement
   .
   ##. Respiratory failure: Likely due to PNA versus chemical pneumonitis.
   Pt likely high risk for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue to monitor pulmonary
   pressures on vent.
   - will continue to sedate on Fentanyl and d/c Midazolam given the [**Last Name (un) **].
   - keep HOB >30 degrees
   .
   ##. GI bleed: Pt noted to have hemoptysis during episode on the floor.
   Pt has history of low GI bleed per his prior medical history that is
   due to gastropathy from portal hypertension. In the unit prior to
   central line placement pt had OGT placed which showed 500+cc of dark
   red blood, as well as clots. Pt's Hct showed a decrease from 33->26,
   although it appears his baseline is around 28-29%. Given that pt is
   still on pressor support we will give a unit of PRBC. Will also reverse
   INR as pt is actively bleeding.
   .
   ##. ST depressions: On review of EKG it appears there is ?STD
   depression in the lateral leads. Pt is chest pain free, cardiac enzymes
   were obtained and showed CK of 15, negative CKMB and Troponin of 0.15.
   Cards were notified of pt's EKG change. Of note pt did have a positive
   stress test several months ago however he was deemed not a candidate
   for cath given his risk for bleeding. Pt is also noted to be at severe
   bleeding to start heparin gtt.
   - pt likely had NSTEMI during his hypoxia
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes down
   .
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history ?HRS
   type II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to
   his hypotension from his shock.
   - will continue on pressors as mentioned above
   - will trend Creatinine
   .
   ##. SBP: PT noted to have SBP, will continue on his current antibiotic
   regimen.

   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: likely combination of sepsis from underlying SBP now with
   aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical pneumonitis given acuity of onset,
   now requiring 2 pressors (phenylephrine and vasopressin) and
   contribution of hemorrhagic component with continued falling HCT
s and
   rising INR in setting of frequent PRBC
s and FFP transfusions.
   -  continue vancomycin, meropenum, flagyl for broad spectrum coverage
   of pneumonia and SBP flora
 consider stopping ciprofloxacin as [**Last Name (un) 614**]
   covers gram neg. and pseudomonas
   -  continue PRBC / FFP transfusions for falling HCT and rising INR
   -  trend fibrinogen and transfuse cryoprecipitate if < 125
   -  follow daily CXR and ABG
   ##. Respiratory failure: likely result of aspiration pneumonia vs.
   chemical pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   - continue ARDs ventilation settings
   - follow with serial ABG
   - continue sedation with Fentayl only, Midazolam discontinued do to
   hepatic dysfunction
   ##. GI bleed: patient with episode of hemoptysis on the floor and hx of
   GI bleed via gastropathy from portal HTN and notable dark red blood and
   clots aspirated by OG tube, now s/p EGD which showed oozing gastropathy
   and now falling HCT and rising INR in setting of multiple transfusions
   overnight.
   - continue PRBC / FFP transfusions for falling HCT and rising INR
   - transfuse cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen < 125
   - continue pressor support to sustain urine output
   ##. ST depressions: continued rising TN
s in the setting of ST
   depressions c/w NSTEMI with h/o of pos. stress test several months
   prior
 however, patient is not a candidate for interventions given
   substantial bleeding risk.  Echo demonstrated LV infero-lateral
   akinesis c/w infarction with increased level of heart dysfunction
   compared to prior.  This most likely is the result of demand ischemia
   in the setting of shock and hemorrhage.
   -
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - continue PRBC and FFP transfusion with pressor support
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension from his shock.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past with near
   2.0 on this admission.
   - continue to trend Cr
 stable
   - continue pressor support to improve renal perfusion
   - FeNa 1.73 suggests not entirely pre-renal in etiology with likely
   intrinsic component
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage
   - continue IAP
s to ensure no abdominal compartment syndrome

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, ascites, cirrhosis, grade I varices, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and recent hospitalization for melena requiring PRBC transfusion. The patient presented for TIPS evaluation but was found to develop spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for continued desaturations.

24-hour events include:
- Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) scope showing oozing gastropathy, with recommendations to reverse INR with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and add carafate 1g QID.

   Assessment and Plan
   ##. GI bleed: patient w/ episode of hemoptysis on the floor and hx of
   GI bleed via portal gastropathy and notable dark red blood and clots
   aspirated by OG tube, now s/p EGD which showed oozing gastropathy.
   Patient now with stable HCT in setting of multiple transfusions.
   - continue PRBC / FFP transfusions for falling HCT and rising INR with
   goal HCT > 30 and INR < 2
   - fibrinogen levels have remained stable in low 200
 transfuse
   cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen < 125
   - urine output continues to remain [**10-7**] / hr continue pressor support
   to sustain urine output > 30 / hr
   - continue supportive care as TIPS is not an option per hepatology
   ##. Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components from ongoing GI bleed and
   aspiration pneumonia / chemical pneumonitis requiring 2 pressors
   -  continue vancomycin, meropenum, flagyl, cipro for broad spectrum
   coverage of pneumonia and SBP flora
   -  continue PRBC / FFP / Cryo transfusions as mentioned above
   -  follow daily CXR and ABG
   -  IV PPI drip, will defer octerotide ggt as on vasopressin
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical
   pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation, along with
   collapse of lung.  Patient failed trial of PSV yesterday.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   - continue ARDs ventilation settings
   - follow with serial ABG
   ##. ST depressions: continued elevated TN
s in setting of ST depression
   and demonstrated wall motion abnormality on echo in the infero-lateral
   area c/w myocardial infarction which most likely resulted from demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and hemorrhage.  Patient is too sick for
   additional cardiac interventions.
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
 now stable
   - continue PRBC and FFP transfusion with pressor support for improved
   myocardial perfusion
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension from his shock.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past with near
   2.0 on this admission.
   - continue to trend Cr
 stable
   - urine output remains low - continue pressor support to improve renal
   perfusion
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage
   - continue IAP
s to ensure no abdominal compartment syndrome
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes
   ##. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   ##. Access: peripherals

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of acidosis cirrhosis, grade I varices, and previous episodes of hemoptysis and GI bleeding due to portal gastropathy. The patient was admitted to the ICU with severe aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis and is now experiencing ongoing GI bleeding from portal gastropathy. The patient has received 24-hour transfusions of PRBCs and FFP, and possible TIPS procedure for portal gastropathy was considered but deemed too risky. The patient failed a trial of PSV and is back on ARDSnet protocol with low oxygen saturation. Compartment pressures trended between 15-18 mmHg. The patient's code status remains full code per family discussion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing hemorrhagic and septic shock due to ongoing GI bleed and aspiration pneumonia/chemical pneumonitis. Pressor support is being given to maintain urine output and blood pressure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure resulting from aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical pneumonitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and ARDS ventilation settings are being followed.
3. ST depressions: The patient has ST depressions and demonstrated wall motion abnormality on echo, indicating myocardial infarction. This is likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of shock and hemorrhage. Cardiac enzymes are being trended, and PRBC and FFP transfusions"

   GI bleed via portal gastropathy and notable dark red blood and clots
   aspirated by OG tube, now s/p EGD which showed oozing gastropathy.
   Patient now with stable HCT in setting of multiple transfusions.
   - continue PRBC / FFP transfusions for falling HCT and rising INR with
   goal HCT > 30 and INR < 2
   - fibrinogen levels have remained stable in low 200
 transfuse
   cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen < 125
   - urine output continues to remain [**10-7**] / hr continue pressor support
   to sustain urine output > 30 / hr
   - continue supportive care as TIPS is not an option per hepatology
   ##. Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components from ongoing GI bleed and
   aspiration pneumonia / chemical pneumonitis requiring 2 pressors
   -  continue vancomycin, meropenum, flagyl, cipro for broad spectrum
   coverage of pneumonia and SBP flora
   -  continue PRBC / FFP / Cryo transfusions as mentioned above
   -  follow daily CXR and ABG
   -  IV PPI drip, will defer octerotide ggt as on vasopressin
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical
   pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation, along with
   collapse of lung.  Patient failed trial of PSV yesterday.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   - continue ARDs ventilation settings
   - follow with serial ABG
   ##. ST depressions: continued elevated TN
s in setting of ST depression
   and demonstrated wall motion abnormality on echo in the infero-lateral
   area c/w myocardial infarction which most likely resulted from demand
   ischemia in setting of shock and hemorrhage.  Patient is too sick for
   additional cardiac interventions.
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
 now stable
   - continue PRBC and FFP transfusion with pressor support for improved
   myocardial perfusion
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension from his shock.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past with near
   2.0 on this admission.
   - continue to trend Cr
 stable
   - urine output remains near 30 cc/hr - continue pressor support to
   improve renal perfusion

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of sarcoidosis and cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for severe aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis. He is currently experiencing ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from portal gastropathy and has been receiving blood transfusions. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including shock, respiratory failure, ST depressions, acute on chronic renal failure, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient's ongoing GI bleeding is a serious concern, as it can lead to hypovolemic shock and further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis, which may require mechanical ventilation support.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's ST depressions and wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram indicate myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia. This can lead to cardiac complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is mildly trending upward, indicating acute kidney injury on top of pre-existing chronic renal failure. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
5. SBP: The patient has been diagnosed with SBP, which increases the risk of infection and sepsis.
6. HRS: The patient's history"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of sarcoidosis and cirrhosis. The patient was transferred to the ICU with severe aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis, as well as ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from portal gastropathy.

The patient has received 24 hours of transfusion history, including 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The possibility of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for portal gastropathy was considered but deemed too risky. The patient is not a candidate for the procedure.

The patient failed a trial of prone ventilation (PSV) and is back on ARDSnet protocol with oxygen saturation levels in the low 90s while on 100% FiO2. The patient continues to have melanic stools, which have decreased in frequency with decreased blood output from the oral gastric (OG) aspirate.

Compartment pressures trended between 15-18 mmHg. The patient is attempting to wean off phenylephrine, a vasopressor. The patient's code status remains full code, decided by the family.

The patient has received various medications, including vancomycin, metronidazole, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, fentanyl, phenylephrine, midazolam (Versed), vasopress"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of sarcoid cirrhosis and chronic GI bleeding. He was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and shock following an aspiration event. The patient has been experiencing continued GI bleeding, and his vital signs are unstable with low blood pressure, high heart rate, and low oxygen saturation. He is currently on multiple medications including vasopressin, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and has demonstrated ST depressions, which are likely due to demand ischemia. He also has a history of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type II, which is worsening due to hypotension and poor forward flow. The patient's renal function is mildly trending up, but his creatinine level remains stable. He has an active infection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. The patient's abdomen is soft and distended, and there are no murmurs or abnormal breath sounds on auscultation. The patient's extremities show no signs of peripheral edema or decreased perfusion. Laboratory results indicate anemia and thrombocytopenia with low platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but his liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are elevated. Imaging shows severe right pneumonia, increased right-sided pleural effusion, and new left-sided pulmonary edema. The patient is currently"

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of sarcoidosis and liver cirrhosis, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following an aspiration event with ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and receiving vasopressin for shock. He has a history of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding with grade I varices. The patient's vital signs are stable with some fluctuations in temperature and blood pressure. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, midodrine, octreotide, pantoprazole, and other medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging reveals severe right pneumonia, increased right-sided pleural effusion, and new left-sided pulmonary edema. The patient has multiple comorbidities including shock, respiratory failure, ST depressions indicative of myocardial ischemia, acute on chronic renal failure, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding leading to further hypovolemic shock.
2. Progression of aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis, worsening respiratory failure.
3. Development of septic shock due to SBP or hospital-acquired infection.
4. Complications related to liver cirrhosis such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, or variceal bleeding.

   There has been no appreciable interval change, aside from slight
   decrease in
   the moderate right pleural effusion. Right lung remains generally
   consolidated due to pneumonia. Interstitial pulmonary edema may have
   improved
   slightly in the left lung but consolidation persists at the base either
   airspace edema or a second focus of pneumonia. ET tube in standard
   placement. Right jugular line ends just below the superior cavoatrial
   junction and nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of

   Assessment and Plan
 ASCITES
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 HEMATEMESIS (UPPER GI BLEED, UGIB)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components from GI bleed and
   aspiration pneumonia requiring single pressor
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, flagyl, cipro for broad spectrum
   coverage of pneumonia and SBP flora
   - monitor serial HCT now stable
 will use PRBC / FFP / Cryo
   transfusions as mentioned above if < 25
   - follow daily CXR and ABG
   - IV PPI drip
   - now on midodrine/octreotide and off pressors [**Last Name (un) 10316**]
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical
   pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation, along with
   collapse of lung.  Patient failed trial of PSV.  CXR now demonstrating
   worsening pulmonary edema on left side suggesting fluid overload,
   ?lobar collapse.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   (vanc/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/cipro)
   - ?lobar collapse on CXR. Will likely do bronch today
   -intraabdominal pressure of 23, will consider paracentesis today
   - follow with serial ABG
   - limit IVF
s for worsening fluid congestion in setting of known AMI
   (other than blood products)
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears intact with
   stable Cr.
    -will verify with liver OK for paracentesis today
   - continue to trend Cr with UOP around 30 cc/hr
    -continue octreotide/midodrine. Continue daily albumin
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage as above
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes
   ##. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   ##. Access: peripherals, consider placing PICC line early next week and
   reducing overall numbers of lines
   ##. Code: Full, considering DNR
   ##. Communication: continue discussion with family concerning goals of
   care and endpoints
   ##. Disposition: ICU

   There has been no appreciable interval change, aside from slight
   decrease in
   the moderate right pleural effusion. Right lung remains generally
   consolidated due to pneumonia. Interstitial pulmonary edema may have
   improved
   slightly in the left lung but consolidation persists at the base either
   airspace edema or a second focus of pneumonia. ET tube in standard

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components from GI bleed and
   aspiration pneumonia requiring single pressor
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, flagyl, cipro for broad spectrum
   coverage of pneumonia and SBP flora
   - monitor serial HCT now stable
 will use PRBC / FFP / Cryo
   transfusions as mentioned above if < 25
   - follow daily CXR and ABG
   - IV PPI drip, will convert to [**Hospital1 7**] PPI tomorrow if HCT remains stable
   (has dropped 3 points since yesterday)
   - now on midodrine and off vasopressin stably
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical
   pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation, along with
   collapse of lung.  Patient failed trial of PSV.  CXR now demonstrating
   worsening pulmonary edema on left side suggesting fluid overload.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   (vanc/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/cipro)
   - continue trial of PSV with goal of [**7-16**] with target Vt 400; currently
   on [**9-17**]
   - follow with serial ABG
   - limit IVF
s for worsening fluid congestion in setting of known AMI
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears intact with
   stable Cr.
   - continue to trend Cr with UOP around 30 cc/hr
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotic coverage
   - IAP stable now 19
 will continue to trend, increasing frequency of
   measurements if UOP decreases
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes
   ##. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   ##. Access: peripherals, consider placing PICC line early next week and
   reducing overall numbers of lines
   ##. Code: Full, considering DNR
   ##. Communication: continue discussion with family concerning goals of
   care and endpoints

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including sepsis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), respiratory failure, ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing hemorrhagic and septic components of shock due to GI bleed and aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and administration of blood products as needed are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely a result of aspiration pneumonia or chemical pneumonitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and non-invasive ventilation strategies such as pressure support ventilation (PSV) should be attempted. Serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis should be performed to assess gas exchange.
3. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient has known ST depressions and wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, suggesting demand ischemia. Supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion should be continued.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of hepatorenal syndrome type II (HRS II) and mildly worsening renal function. Close monitoring of creatinine levels and urine output is required.
5. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has a history of SBP"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple health issues including respiratory failure, cirrhosis, aspiration pneumonia, renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia. There is an ongoing discussion regarding bronchoscopy to address right middle lobe atelectasis. The ventilator settings will be left unchanged until after the patient's transfusion.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient is still experiencing GIB despite previous interventions. There is a need for further evaluation and management by hepatology. PPI (proton pump inhibitor) has been initiated, and the patient is being considered for transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to ongoing bleeding.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is also suffering from acute renal failure. Octreotide/midodrine therapy has been resumed, and there is a possibility of performing paracentesis today due to the elevated bladder pressure.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is being managed with ongoing treatment and appreciation of hepatology input.

5. Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection, specifically hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Antibiotics have been continued for this condition.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with respiratory failure, cirrhosis, aspiration pneumonia, renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. 

24-hour events include the resumption of GI bleed and the initiation of octreotide and midodrine. The patient is off pressors, receiving multiple antibiotics, and being treated with various medications such as fentanyl, flagyl, meropenem, pantoprazole, sucralfate, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, lactulose, and albumin.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/52 to 122/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The respiratory system examination reveals coarse rales on the right side.

The patient's abdomen is soft and protuberant with right lower extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and liver function abnormalities. Blood cultures were taken multiple times.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components from GI bleed and
   aspiration pneumonia requiring single pressor
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, flagyl, cipro for broad spectrum
   coverage of pneumonia and SBP flora; tap showed SBP, will continue
   cipro for tx and consider ceftriaxone
   - monitor serial HCT Q8 (s/p 2 units PRBC, 2 units FFP)
 will use PRBC
   / FFP / Cryo transfusions as mentioned above if < 25
   - follow daily CXR and ABG
   - IV PPI drip
   - now on midodrine/octreotide and off pressors [**Last Name (un) 10316**]
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical
   pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation, along with
   collapse of lung. CXR yesterday demonstrating worsening pulmonary edema
   suggesting fluid overload, ?lobar collapse.
   -failed [**7-13**], will continue on [**7-16**] for now
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   (vanc/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/cipro)
   - ?lobar collapse on CXR. bronch showed no plugs; able to get out
   copious suction yesterday though
   -intraabdominal pressure elevated, only able to get off 1L yesterday.
   Should retap today
   - follow with serial ABG
   - limit IVF
s for worsening fluid congestion in setting of known AMI
   (other than blood products)
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears intact with
   stable Cr.
    -will verify with liver OK for paracentesis today
   - continue to trend Cr with UOP around 30 cc/hr
    -continue octreotide/midodrine. Continue daily albumin
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   -continue ciprofloxacin, consider to switching to therapeutic dose of
   ceftriaxone
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes
   ##. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   ##. Access: peripherals, consider placing PICC line early next week and
   reducing overall numbers of lines  if Hct stable
   ##. Code: Full, considering DNR
   ##. Communication: continue discussion with family concerning goals of

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a complex medical history, including cirrhosis, ASCIIs, and portal hypertension, presenting with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), sepsis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), respiratory failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypotension, renal failure, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing hemorrhagic and septic components of shock due to GI bleed and aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and timely administration of appropriate fluids and vasopressors are crucial.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be attributed to aspiration pneumonia or chemical pneumonitis. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, as well as following serial chest X-rays and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, is necessary.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which can further worsen due to hypotension and poor renal perfusion. Frequent monitoring of serum creatinine levels and urine output is essential.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE): Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction, there is a risk of developing HE. Monitoring for altered mental status and timely"

 HEMATEMESIS (UPPER GI BLEED, UGIB)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components from GI bleed and
   aspiration pneumonia requiring single pressor
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, flagyl, cipro for broad spectrum
   coverage of pneumonia and SBP flora; tap showed SBP, will continue
   cipro for tx and consider ceftriaxone
   - monitor serial HCT Q8 (s/p 2 units PRBC, 2 units FFP)
 will use PRBC
   / FFP / Cryo transfusions as mentioned above if < 25
   - follow daily CXR and ABG
   - IV PPI drip
   - now on midodrine/octreotide and off pressors [**Last Name (un) 10316**]
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical
   pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation, along with
   collapse of lung. CXR yesterday demonstrating worsening pulmonary edema
   suggesting fluid overload, ?lobar collapse.
   -failed [**7-13**], will continue on [**7-16**] for now
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   (vanc/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/cipro)
   - ?lobar collapse on CXR. bronch showed no plugs; able to get out
   copious suction yesterday though
   -intraabdominal pressure elevated, only able to get off 1L yesterday.
   Should retap today
   - follow with serial ABG
   - limit IVF
s for worsening fluid congestion in setting of known AMI
   (other than blood products)
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears intact with
   stable Cr.
    -will verify with liver OK for paracentesis today
   - continue to trend Cr with UOP around 30 cc/hr
    -continue octreotide/midodrine. Continue daily albumin
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   -continue current abx. Consider cover fungal
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes
   ##. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   ##. Access: peripherals, consider placing PICC line early next week and
   reducing overall numbers of lines  if Hct stable
   ##. Code: Full, considering DNR
   ##. Communication: continue discussion with family concerning goals of
   care and endpoints

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. The patient underwent several procedures and interventions, including an EKG, bronchoscopic evaluation, and paracentesis. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 117/59 mmHg to 128/69 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 93%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 36.6°C.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including octreotide, midodrine, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and various antibiotics. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, elevated platelet count (Plt), and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated bilirubin (T Bili) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The blood culture is pending, while the urine culture shows an infection.

Imaging studies reveal dense right consolidation and volume loss, along with right pleural fluid progression. There is also evidence of worsening fluid status on the left side.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components from GI bleed and
   aspiration pneumonia requiring single pressor
   - continue vancomycin, meropenem, flagyl, cipro for broad spectrum
   coverage of pneumonia and SBP flora; tap showed SBP,
   - monitor serial HCT Q8 (s/p 2 units PRBC, 2 units FFP)
 will use PRBC
   / FFP / Cryo transfusions as mentioned above if < 25
   - follow daily CXR and ABG
   - IV PPI drip
   - now on midodrine/octreotide and off pressors [**Last Name (un) 10316**]
   -new diagnosis of SBP despite meropenem coverage. Will consult with
   liver regarding possible fungal coverage.
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia vs. chemical
   pneumonitis given rapid progression and presentation, along with
   collapse of lung. CXR yesterday demonstrating worsening pulmonary edema
   suggesting fluid overload, ?lobar collapse.
   -failed [**7-13**], will continue on [**7-16**] for now
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above
   (vanc/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/cipro)
   - ?lobar collapse on CXR. bronch showed no plugs; able to get out
   copious suction yesterday though
   -intraabdominal pressure elevated, only able to get off 1L yesterday.
   Should retap today vs. diuresis, but will discuss with liver first
   - follow with serial ABG
   - limit IVF
s for worsening fluid congestion in setting of known AMI
   (other than blood products)
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears intact with
   stable Cr.
    -will verify with liver OK for paracentesis today
   - continue to trend Cr with UOP around 30 cc/hr
    -continue octreotide/midodrine. Continue daily albumin
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   -continue current abx. Consider cover fungal
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes
   ##. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   ##. Access: peripherals, consider placing PICC line early next week and

   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components from ongoing GI bleed,
   aspiration pneumonia and now continued SBP despite broad spectrum
   coverage
 on midodrine and octreotide for hemodynamic support and
   ongoing GI bleed
   - continue vancomycin, meropenumum, flagyl and cipro for broad spectrum
   coverage of pneumonia and SBP flora
   - consider anti-fungal coverage for continued SBP in setting of
   meropenum coverage.
   - continue IV PPI drip and octreotide for ongoing GI bleed
   - monitor serial HCT, coags and fibrinogen q8 hour, transfusing with
   PRBC
s, FFP and Cryo as necessary
   - f/u daily CXR and ABG
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia with likely
   component of chemical pneumonitis, now with worsening airspace disease
   and partial right lung collapse and pulmonary edema, unimproved s/p
   brochoscopy.
   - continue PSV with attempt to wean as tolerated
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as discussed above
   - consider additional therapeutic paracentesis to reduce IAP and aid in
   ability to wean off vent
   - limit IVF and volume with know fluid overload and well documented AMI
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past

   stable Cr.
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue octreotide / midodrine and daily albumin to improve
   hemodynamics

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, ascites, grade I varices, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. He was initially admitted for TIPS evaluation for GI bleed and was subsequently diagnosed with SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and transferred to the ICU after an aspiration event resulting in aspiration pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and ongoing GI bleed requiring continued transfusions.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components from ongoing GI bleed, aspiration pneumonia, and continued SBP despite broad-spectrum coverage.
2. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia with likely component of chemical pneumonitis, now with worsening airspace disease and partial right lung collapse and pulmonary edema, unimproved s/p brochoscopy.
3. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely due to demand ischemia with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt noted to have a history of HRS type II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his hypotension and poor forward flow. Baseline noted to be 1.5 in the past with near 2.0 on this admission. Renal function appears intact with stable Cr.
5. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, ascites, grade I varices, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. He was initially admitted for TIPS evaluation for GI bleed, diagnosed with SBP, and subsequently transferred to the ICU after an aspiration event with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and ongoing GI bleed requiring continued transfusions. The patient's family decided to make him DNR (do not resuscitate) with plans to likely make him a comfort measure only patient after his daughter arrives from [**Name (NI)**] today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: Hemorrhagic and septic components from ongoing GI bleed, aspiration pneumonia, and now continued SBP despite broad-spectrum coverage.
2. Respiratory failure: Result of aspiration pneumonia with likely component of chemical pneumonitis, now with worsening airspace disease and partial right lung collapse and pulmonary edema, unimproved s/p brochoscopy.
3. ST depressions: Patient with known MI likely due to demand ischemia with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his hypotension and poor forward flow.
5. SBP: Diagnosed by prior paracentesis.
6. FEN (Feeding): No IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, restart tube feeds.
7. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots.

   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: initially with hemorrhagic and septic components with
   aspiration pneumonia, continued SBP and ongoing GIB
 now on midodrine
   and octreotide for hemodynamic support, shock state resolved
   - continue vancomycin ([**8-31**]), meropenumum ([**8-30**]), flagyl ([**8-30**]) and
   cipro ([**8-30**]) for broad spectrum coverage of continued pneumonia and SBP
   flora
   - consider anti-fungal coverage for continued SBP in setting of
   meropenum coverage.
   - continue IV PPI drip and octreotide for GI bleed
   - patient required 1 unit FFP for INR 3.0 - monitor serial HCT, coags
   and fibrinogen q8 hour, transfusing with PRBC
s, FFP and Cryo as
   necessary
   - f/u daily CXR and ABG
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia and chemical
   pneumonitis, now with continued airspace disease now effecting left
   lung, CXR demonstrating mild improvement in aeration of RLL
   - continue PSV with attempt to wean as tolerated
 now at PSV 8 PS / 10
   PEEP
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as discussed above
   - consider additional therapeutic paracentesis to reduce IAP and aid in
   ability to wean off vent
   - patient with substantial urine output but difficult to achieve
   negative balance when requiring blood products - continue IV lasix drip
   titrate to goal negative 1L -  patient remains 16.5 L pos. for LOS
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO.
   Patient now with runs of narrow complex, irregular tachycardia to [**Street Address(2) 10365**] depressions in V4 and mild Tn increase from 3.0 to
   3.3.  Patient rate controlled with Metoprolol 5 mg IV to prevent demand
   additional demand ischemia.
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   - continue to rate control as necessary with Metoprolol
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears intact with
   stable Cr.  Patient recently started on lasix drip with adequate urine
   output.
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue octreotide / midodrine and daily albumin to improve
   hemodynamics
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above,  consider
   broadening coverage to include anti-fungals
   ##. FEN: attempting to limit total IVF in, replete electrolytes PRN,
   restart tube feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, ascites, grade I varices, pulmonary sarcoidosis. He was initially admitted for TIPS evaluation for GI bleed, diagnosed with SBP, and subsequently transferred to the ICU after an aspiration event with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and ongoing GI bleed requiring continued transfusions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 117/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 483 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 218, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse crackles in the bilateral lungs but improved airflow on the right compared to prior exams. The patient's abdomen is soft and distended, with no masses or less tympanic than prior"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: initially with hemorrhagic and septic components with
   aspiration pneumonia, continued SBP and ongoing GIB
 now on midodrine
   and octreotide for hemodynamic support, shock state resolved
   - continue vancomycin ([**8-31**]), meropenumum ([**8-30**]), flagyl ([**8-30**]) and
   cipro ([**8-30**]) for broad spectrum coverage of continued pneumonia and SBP
   flora
   - consider anti-fungal coverage for continued SBP in setting of
   meropenum coverage.
   - continue IV PPI drip and octreotide for GI bleed
   - patient required 1 unit FFP for INR 3.0 - monitor serial HCT, coags
   and fibrinogen q8 hour, transfusing with PRBC
s, FFP and Cryo as
   necessary
   - f/u daily CXR and ABG
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia and chemical
   pneumonitis, now with continued airspace disease now effecting left
   lung, CXR demonstrating mild improvement in aeration of RLL
   - continue PSV with attempt to wean as tolerated
 now at PSV 8 PS / 10
   PEEP
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as discussed above
   - consider additional therapeutic paracentesis to reduce IAP and aid in
   ability to wean off vent
   - patient with substantial urine output but difficult to achieve
   negative balance when requiring blood products - continue IV lasix drip
   titrate to goal negative 1L -  patient remains 16.5 L pos. for LOS
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO.
   Patient now with runs of narrow complex, irregular tachycardia to [**Street Address(2) 10365**] depressions in V4 and mild Tn increase from 3.0 to
   3.3.  Patient rate controlled with Metoprolol 5 mg IV to prevent demand
   additional demand ischemia.
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   - continue to rate control as necessary with Metoprolol
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears intact with
   stable Cr.  Patient recently started on lasix drip with adequate urine
   output.
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue octreotide / midodrine and daily albumin to improve
   hemodynamics
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above,  consider
   broadening coverage to include anti-fungals
   ##. FEN: attempting to limit total IVF in, replete electrolytes PRN,
   restart tube feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, ascites, grade I varices, pulmonary sarcoidosis. He was initially admitted for TIPS evaluation for GI bleed, diagnosed with SBP, and subsequently transferred to the ICU after an aspiration event resulting in aspiration pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and ongoing GI bleed requiring continued transfusions.

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: Initially with hemorrhagic and septic components with aspiration pneumonia, continued SBP, and ongoing GIB (gastrointestinal bleeding). The patient is now on midodrine and octreotide for hemodynamic support, and the shock state has resolved.
2. Respiratory failure: Resulting from aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis, now with continued airspace disease affecting the left lung. The patient continues to receive PSV (pressure support ventilation) with attempts to wean as tolerated, currently at PSV 8 PS / 10 PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and additional therapeutic paracentesis may be considered to reduce intra-abdominal pressure and aid in weaning off the ventilator.
3. ST depressions: The patient has known MI (myocardial infarction) likely due to demand ischemia with elevated TN (troponin) and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO. The patient now has runs of narrow complex, irregular tachycard"

   - continue vancomycin ([**8-31**]), meropenumum ([**8-30**]), flagyl ([**8-30**]) and
   cipro ([**8-30**]) for broad spectrum coverage of continued pneumonia and SBP
   flora
   - consider anti-fungal coverage for continued SBP in setting of
   meropenum coverage.
   - continue IV PPI drip and octreotide for GI bleed
   - patient required 1 unit FFP for INR 3.0 - monitor serial HCT, coags
   and fibrinogen q8 hour, transfusing with PRBC
s, FFP and Cryo as
   necessary
   - f/u daily CXR and ABG
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia and chemical
   pneumonitis, now with continued airspace disease now effecting left
   lung, CXR demonstrating mild improvement in aeration of RLL
   - continue PSV with attempt to wean as tolerated
 now at PSV 8 PS / 10
   PEEP
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as discussed above
   - consider additional therapeutic paracentesis to reduce IAP and aid in
   ability to wean off vent
   - patient with substantial urine output but difficult to achieve
   negative balance when requiring blood products - continue IV lasix drip
   titrate to goal negative 1L -  patient remains 16.5 L pos. for LOS

   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO.
   Patient now with runs of narrow complex, irregular tachycardia to [**Street Address(2) 10365**] depressions in V4 and mild Tn increase from 3.0 to
   3.3.  Patient rate controlled with Metoprolol 5 mg IV to prevent demand
   additional demand ischemia.
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   - continue to rate control as necessary with Metoprolol
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears intact with
   stable Cr.  Patient recently started on lasix drip with adequate urine
   output.
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue octreotide / midodrine and daily albumin to improve
   hemodynamics

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, ascites, grade I varices, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. The patient was initially admitted for TIPS evaluation for GI bleed, diagnosed with SBP, and subsequently transferred to the ICU after an aspiration event with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and ongoing GI bleed requiring continued transfusions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/70 to 141/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 483 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 19.8-21.6 thousand cells/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 33.9-35.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 90-91 thousand cells/mm3, creatinine (Cr) of 2.3-2.4 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.30-0.33 ng/mL, and lactic acid of 2.6 mmol/L. The patient's imaging shows evidence of pulmonary edema and partial right lung collapse.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing hemorrhagic and septic components due to ongoing GI bleed, aspiration pneumonia, and continued SBP despite broad-spectrum coverage. The patient requires hemodynamic support with midodrine and octreotide for ongoing GI bleed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has aspiration pneumonia with worsening airspace disease and partial right lung collapse, leading to respiratory failure. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, PSV ventilation, and therapeutic paracentesis may be necessary.
3. ST depressions: The patient has known myocardial infarction (MI) likely due to demand ischemia with elevated troponin-T levels and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO. Supportive measures should be continued to improve myocardial perfusion.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a history of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type II, and renal function is mildly trending up due to hypotension and poor forward flow. Close monitoring of creatinine and urine output is essential.
5. SBP: The patient has diagnosed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and requires continued broad-spectrum antibiotics, with consideration of broadening coverage to include anti-fungals.
6. FEN: The patient requires enteral nutrition, and"

   ##. Resolved Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components with aspiration
   pneumonia and continued SBP in setting of worsening liver function and
   intermittent GIB
   - continue vancomycin ([**8-31**]), meropenumum ([**8-30**]), flagyl ([**8-30**]) and
   cipro ([**8-30**]) for broad spectrum coverage of continued pneumonia and SBP
   flora
   - consider fluconazole for anti-fungal coverage in setting of continued
   SBP with negative cultures and sputum cultures positive for fungus
   - continue IV PPI drip and octreotide for GI bleed
   - monitor serial HCT, coags and fibrinogen q 8 hour, transfusing with
   PRBC
s, FFP and Cryo as necessary for goal HCT > 25 and goal INR < 3.0
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia and chemical
   pneumonitis, now with continued airspace disease now effecting left
   lung, CXR demonstrating mild improvement in aeration of RLL.  Barriers
   to extubation include mental status, underlying pneumonia and elevated
   intra-abdominal pressures.
   - continue PSV with attempt to wean as tolerated
 now at PSV 8 PS / 5
   PEEP with good blood gas, attempt RSBI and if promising a SBT to gauge
   ability to come off ventilator
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as discussed above
   - consider IR guided large volume paracentesis to facilitate
   respiratory status pending goals of care
   - patient with substantial urine output but difficult to achieve
   negative balance as requiring continued blood products
 creatinine
   continues to trend up

   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO.
   Patient now with runs of narrow complex, irregular tachycardia to [**Street Address(2) 10365**] depressions in V4 and mild Tn increase from 3.0 to
   3.3, now stable at 3.3.  Patient rate controlled with Metoprolol 5 mg
   IV to prevent additional demand ischemia.
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   - continue to rate control as necessary with Metoprolol
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears but Cr now
   above baseline at 2.5.  Patient recently started on lasix drip with
   adequate urine output.
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue octreotide / midodrine and daily albumin to improve
   hemodynamics
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - consider fluconazole for anti-fungal coverage in setting of continued
   SBP despite broad spectrum antibiotics and sputum culture showing
   moderate fungal growth

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, ascites, grade I varices, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. He was initially admitted for TIPS evaluation for GI bleed and was diagnosed with SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). The patient subsequently developed an aspiration event leading to aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis. He also has ongoing GI bleeding requiring continued transfusions.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 111/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's lab results show an increased white blood cell count of 17.4 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 31.9%, elevated creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes. The blood cultures are negative, but sputum cultures show moderate growth of fungus.

The patient's imaging shows improvement in aeration of the right lower lung field. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, anti-fungal coverage, and continues to receive IV PPI drip and octreotide for GI bleed. His respiratory support includes PSV with attempt to"

   ascites, grade I varices, pulmonary sarcoidosis initially admitted for
   TIPS evaluation for GI bleed, diagnosed with SBP and then subsequently
   transferred to ICU after aspriation event with concenquent aspiration
   pneumonia, chemical pneumonities and problem of ongoing GI bleed
   requiring continued transfusions
   24 Hour Events:
   - family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 775**]:  daughter upset and having difficulty
   handling the situation re: goals of care
   - HCT fell from 36 to 31 at 1800, then remained stable
   - d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**]: in the setting of multi-organ system failure, the
   possibility of liver transplant is off the table, goals of care should
   be focused on palliation
   - given 1 units of FFP for INR 2.8, then 2 additional units for INR of
   2.9
   -liver recs: consider anti-fungal coverage, consider re-culturing blood
   for fungus, consider 2-3 L paracentesis to aid weaning from vent;
   continue octreotide, midodrine, change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], future
   recommendations will depend on goals of care.

   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Resolved Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components with aspiration
   pneumonia and continued SBP in setting of worsening liver function and
   intermittent GIB
   - continue vancomycin ([**8-31**]), meropenumum ([**8-30**]), flagyl ([**8-30**]) and
   cipro ([**8-30**]) for broad spectrum coverage of continued pneumonia and SBP
   flora
   - add fluconazole for anti-fungal coverage in setting of continued SBP
   with negative cultures and sputum cultures positive for fungus
   - continue IV PPI drip and octreotide for GI bleed
   - monitor serial HCT, coags and fibrinogen q 8 hour, transfusing with
   PRBC
s, FFP and Cryo as necessary for goal HCT > 25 and goal INR < 3.0
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia and chemical
   pneumonitis, now with continued airspace disease now effecting left
   lung, CXR demonstrating mild improvement in aeration of RLL.  Barriers
   to extubation include mental status, underlying pneumonia and elevated
   intra-abdominal pressures.
   - continue PSV with attempt to wean as tolerated
 now at PSV 8 PS / 5
   PEEP with good blood gas, attempt RSBI and if promising a SBT to gauge
   ability to come off ventilator
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as discussed above
   - attempt IR guided large volume paracentesis to facilitate respiratory
   status
   - patient with substantial urine output but difficult to achieve
   negative balance as requiring continued blood products - continue IV
   lasix drip titrate to goal negative 1L -  patient now 16.94 L pos. for
   LOS
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO.
   Patient now with runs of narrow complex, irregular tachycardia to [**Street Address(2) 10365**] depressions in V4 and mild Tn increase from 3.0 to
   3.3, now stable at 3.3.  Patient rate controlled with Metoprolol 5 mg
   IV to prevent additional demand ischemia.
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   - continue to rate control as necessary with Metoprolol
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears but Cr now
   above baseline at 2.5.  Patient recently started on lasix drip with
   adequate urine output.
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue octreotide / midodrine and daily albumin to improve
   hemodynamics
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - add fluconazole for anti-fungal coverage in setting of continued SBP
   despite broad spectrum antibiotics and sputum culture showing moderate
   fungal growth

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of multi-organ system failure, liver transplant evaluation, and chronic renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU due to hemorrhagic and septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He also has a history of myocardial infarction.

Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with hemorrhagic and septic shock. The shock state is associated with low blood pressure, inadequate tissue perfusion, and organ dysfunction.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient developed aspiration pneumonia, likely due to the inability to protect his airway. This has resulted in airspace disease affecting his left lung.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to hypotension and anemia.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function has been compromised due to aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure-controlled ventilation (CPAP/PSV) and has been titrated to maintain adequate oxygenation.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated further during this admission. He has a history of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type II and his serum creatinine level is now above baseline"

   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Shock: initially with hemorrhagic and septic components with
   aspiration pneumonia, continued SBP and ongoing GIB
 now on midodrine

   - continue vancomycin ([**8-31**]), meropenumum ([**8-30**]), flagyl ([**8-30**]) and
   cipro ([**8-30**]) for broad spectrum coverage of continued pneumonia and SBP
   flora
   - consider anti-fungal coverage for continued SBP in setting of
   meropenum coverage.
   - continue IV PPI drip and octreotide for GI bleed
   - patient required 1 unit FFP for INR 3.0 - monitor serial HCT, coags
   and fibrinogen q8 hour, transfusing with PRBC
s, FFP and Cryo as
   necessary for goal HCT > 25
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia and chemical
   pneumonitis, now with continued airspace disease now effecting left
   lung, CXR demonstrating mild improvement in aeration of RLL
   - continue PSV with attempt to wean as tolerated
 now at PSV 8 PS / 10
   PEEP
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as discussed above
   - patient with substantial urine output but difficult to achieve
   negative balance when requiring blood products - continue IV lasix drip
   titrate to goal negative 1L -  patient remains 16.5 L pos. for LOS
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO.
   Patient now with runs of narrow complex, irregular tachycardia to [**Street Address(2) 10365**] depressions in V4 and mild Tn increase from 3.0 to
   3.3.  Patient rate controlled with Metoprolol 5 mg IV to prevent demand
   additional demand ischemia.
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   - continue to rate control as necessary with Metoprolol
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears intact with
   stable Cr.  Patient recently started on lasix drip with adequate urine
   output.
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue octreotide / midodrine and daily albumin to improve
   hemodynamics
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as documented above,  consider
   broadening coverage to include anti-fungals depending on goals of care
   ##. FEN: attempting to limit total IVF in, replete electrolytes PRN,
   restart tube feeds
   ##. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including aspiration pneumonia, septic shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute kidney injury, liver failure, and a history of chronic renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for aggressive management of these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable due to aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis. There is evidence of airspace disease affecting the left lung, and the patient requires ventilatory support. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient continues to experience intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The bleeding is likely due to stress ulcers caused by septic shock and requires ongoing treatment with IV pantoprazole (Protonix) and octreotide. Close monitoring of hemodynamic stability and coagulation parameters is essential.

3. Liver Failure: The patient exhibits signs of liver failure, including elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal coagulation profile (PTT/INR). Fungal infection in the bloodstream should be considered, and antifungal coverage may be required. Serial monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation parameters is necessary.

4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has developed acute kidney injury, likely secondary to hypotension and poor renal perfusion. Close monitoring of renal function through serial measurements of serum creat"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient's family had a difficult time accepting the situation and discussing goals of care.
2. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) level dropped from 36 to 31 at 1800, but remained stable afterward.
3. In the setting of multi-organ system failure, the possibility of liver transplant was ruled out, and the focus should be on palliative care.
4. The patient received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to an elevated INR of 2.8, and an additional 2 units for an INR of 2.9.
5. Recommendations included considering anti-fungal coverage, re-culturing blood for fungus, performing a 2-3 L paracentesis to aid weaning from the ventilator, continuing octreotide and midodrine, and switching to IV pantoprazole.
6. The patient has no known drug allergies.
7. The patient has been receiving various medications, including octreotide, pantoprazole, furosemide, diltiazem, metoprolol, and others.
8. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
   - Temperature: 36.7 C (98.1 F) at maximum and 36.3 C (97.4 F) currently.
   - Heart rate: 76 bpm with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   ##. Resolved Shock: hemorrhagic and septic components with aspiration
   pneumonia and continued SBP in setting of worsening liver function and
   intermittent GIB
   - continue vancomycin ([**8-31**]), meropenumum ([**8-30**]), flagyl ([**8-30**]) and
   cipro ([**8-30**]) for broad spectrum coverage of continued pneumonia and SBP
   flora
   - add fluconazole for anti-fungal coverage in setting of continued SBP
   with negative cultures and sputum cultures positive for fungus
   - continue IV PPI drip and octreotide for GI bleed
   - monitor serial HCT, coags and fibrinogen q 8 hour, transfusing with
   PRBC
s, FFP and Cryo as necessary for goal HCT > 25 and goal INR < 3.0
   ##. Respiratory failure: result of aspiration pneumonia and chemical
   pneumonitis, now with continued airspace disease now effecting left
   lung, CXR demonstrating mild improvement in aeration of RLL.  Barriers
   to extubation include mental status, underlying pneumonia and elevated
   intra-abdominal pressures.
   - continue PSV with attempt to wean as tolerated
 now at PSV 8 PS / 5
   PEEP with good blood gas, attempt RSBI and if promising a SBT to gauge
   ability to come off ventilator
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics as discussed above
   - attempt IR guided large volume paracentesis to facilitate respiratory
   status
   - patient with substantial urine output but difficult to achieve
   negative balance as requiring continued blood products - continue IV
   lasix drip titrate to goal negative 1L -  patient now 16.94 L pos. for
   LOS
   ##. ST depressions: patient with known MI likely do to demand ischemia
   with elevated TN and wall motion abnormality demonstrated by ECHO.
   Patient now with runs of narrow complex, irregular tachycardia to [**Street Address(2) 10365**] depressions in V4 and mild Tn increase from 3.0 to
   3.3, now stable at 3.3.  Patient rate controlled with Metoprolol 5 mg
   IV to prevent additional demand ischemia.
   - continue supportive measures to improve myocardial perfusion
   - continue to rate control as necessary with Metoprolol
   ##. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt noted to have a history HRS type
   II. Given renal function is mildly trending up, likely related to his
   hypotension  and poor forward flow.  Baseline noted to be 1.5 in past
   with near 2.0 on this admission.  Renal function appears but Cr now
   above baseline at 2.5.  Patient recently started on lasix drip with
   adequate urine output.
   - continue to trend Cr and UOP
   - continue octreotide / midodrine and daily albumin to improve
   hemodynamics
   ##. SBP: diagnosed by prior paracentesis
   - add fluconazole for anti-fungal coverage in setting of continued SBP
   despite broad spectrum antibiotics and sputum culture showing moderate
   fungal growth

He was initially admitted for TIPS evaluation for GI bleed, diagnosed with SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and subsequently transferred to the ICU after an aspiration event with consequent aspiration pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and ongoing GI bleed requiring continued transfusions.

The patient's family is struggling with the decision to make code status changes, currently the patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status. The family is having difficulty handling the situation regarding goals of care.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 111/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 527 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, PaO2 of 238, and HCO3- of 95. The patient's respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hepatic sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, ascites, grade I varices, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. He was initially admitted for TIPS evaluation for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and subsequently transferred to the ICU after an aspiration event leading to aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis. The patient has ongoing GI bleeding requiring continuous transfusions and continued SBP despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient experienced an aspiration event, resulting in aspiration pneumonia.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation level (SpO2: 90%) indicates potential respiratory failure.
3. SBP: The patient has ongoing SBP despite antibiotic therapy, which poses a risk for further infection and complications.
4. GI Bleeding: The patient continues to have ongoing GI bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and shock.
5. NSTEMI: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest a possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
6. AFIB with RVR: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB with RVR), which increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.
7. Acute on Chronic RF: The patient has acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure, as"

He was initially admitted for TIPS evaluation for GI bleed, diagnosed with SBP, and subsequently transferred to the ICU after an aspiration event with consequent aspiration pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and ongoing GI bleed requiring continued transfusions.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has shown improvement in his respiratory status. He is on multiple medications including morphine sulfate, metoprolol, lorazepam, furosemide, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 51/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. His neurological status is not assessed.

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 48 mL. His blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels. Imaging studies are pending.

The patient's condition is complicated by ongoing GI bleeding, aspiration pneumonia, and chemical pneumonitis. He is on comfort measures only code status. The patient's prognosis is guarded due to his multiple comorbidities and current medical"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, currently admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring invasive ventilation and continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters. The patient's recent events include invasive ventilation termination, administration of various antibiotics, and continuous infusion of morphine sulfate for pain management. 

The patient's current vital signs show hypotension (BP: 51/30 mmHg), tachycardia (HR: 88 bpm), and low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 90%). The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 501 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%. The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,992 mL and output of 3,040 mL since 12 AM, resulting in a negative balance of -48 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis (WBC: 17.4 K/uL), elevated creatinine (Cr: 2.4 mg/dL), elevated lactate (Lactic Acid: 2.6 mmol/L), hyponatremia (Na+: 111 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (K+: 5.4 mEq/L), and hypoalbuminemia (Albumin: 2.5 g/dL). Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis-induced hypotension and organ dysfunction: The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest inadequate tissue perfusion, which may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury or respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's low oxygen saturation and high respiratory rate indicate potential respiratory distress or inefficient gas exchange. This could be due to pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output suggest impaired renal function, which could be due to sepsis-induced acute kidney injury or pre-existing chronic kidney disease.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia and hyperkalemia may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. Infection: Despite receiving multiple antibiotics, the patient's persistent leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels suggest ongoing infection, which may require adjustment in antibiotic therapy or identification of resistant pathogens.

Overall, the patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and aggressive management to address potential complications and optimize organ function."
