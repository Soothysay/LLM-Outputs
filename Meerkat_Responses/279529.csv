   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with sudden onset shortness of breath on Saturday night, worsening dyspnea on exertion, and found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient presented with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and worsening congestive heart failure (CHF), with possible other differentials including pulmonary embolism (PE) or pneumonia (PNA). 

On examination, the patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 97/63 mmHg, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient has distant heart sounds with no murmurs appreciated, right and left lower extremity edema, and crackles and wheezes on respiratory examination. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated cardiac enzymes with a CK-MB of 7-11-9-6 and Troponin T of 1.73-1.67-1.73-1.77. Other lab values include a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, sodium of 107 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, and glucose of 116-118 mg/dL. 

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including heparin sodium, ASA 325, Plavix 75, atorvastatin 80, diuretics for fluid management, and antibiotics for suspected infection. 

The patient's condition is complicated by cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal ventricle, as evidenced by the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing dilated left atrium (LA), mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), severe LV systolic dysfunction, and right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, infection, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the critical care setting."

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of sudden onset shortness of breath on Saturday night, which worsened over the course of the day. He was found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/63 mmHg to 131/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals distant heart sounds with no murmurs, crackles and wheezes in the chest, right and left lower extremity edema of 4+ with a non-pitting quality, and soft non-tender abdomen. 

Laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes (CK-MB and Troponin T), as well as elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and potassium levels. Other lab values include slightly elevated glucose and calcium levels, and normal magnesium and phosphate levels. 

The patient has been treated with various medications including heparin sodium, dopamine, albuterol nebs, ASA, Plavix, atorvastatin, diuretics, and ciprofloxacin. 

The assessment and plan include suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with worsening congestive heart failure (CHF), possible pulmonary embolism (PE),"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who presented with sudden onset shortness of breath (SOB) on Saturday night, worsening dyspnea on exertion (DOE), and was found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and treatment.

24-hour events include weaning off dopamine drip, undergoing a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) that showed dilated left atrium, mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of distal 1-6 ventricle, ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, no masses or thrombi, right ventricular hypokinesis of apical free wall with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Cardiac enzymes continue to be elevated. The patient reported feeling intermittently wheezy and received albuterol nebs with good effect. No chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other pain was reported.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

Infusions: Heparin sodium at 2,250 units/hour.

Other ICU medications: Not specified.

Changes to medical and family history: Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who presented with sudden onset shortness of breath on Saturday night. He was found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient's condition has been stable overnight, and he received intermittent wheezing treatment with albuterol nebs. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/63 mmHg to 131/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight has decreased from 139.9 kg at admission to 134 kg currently. His fluid balance shows an intake of 1,706 mL and output of 3,260 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,554 mL. The patient has been receiving heparin sodium infusion and various medications including ASA, Plavix, atorvastatin, and diuretics. His cardiac enzymes are still elevated, and he has been cycling them. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin T levels. His blood glucose levels have been stable between 116-118 mg/dL. The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds with no murmurs, right and left radial pulses present, diminished right and left digital pulses"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who presented with sudden onset shortness of breath and worsening dyspnea on exertion. He was found to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient has a history of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF), and his current condition suggests possible cardiogenic shock. There are no clear signs of infection, but there is an elevated white blood cell count and temperature. The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus, and he is on beta-blockers and diltiazem. His vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, but his liver enzymes and troponin levels are elevated. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple comorbidities, including ACS, CHF, and possible PE.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's symptoms and elevated filling pressures suggest possible cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation may indicate an increased risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and oxygen supplementation are necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobilization and history of ACS/CHF put him at risk for developing DVT/PE"

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 mmHg to 136/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula, and temperature of 37.4°C. The patient is awake and alert, with distant heart sounds, regular rhythm, scattered wheezes throughout the lungs, and 4+ nonpitting edema of lower extremities bilaterally. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, troponin T levels, and glucose. Other labs are within normal ranges. The patient's electrolytes are also within normal limits.

The patient's current assessment and plan include ongoing management for coronary artery disease with ASA, Plavix, and atorvastatin. Diuresis is being continued with the goal of 1-2 liters output daily, and serial EKGs are being performed. The possibility of a repeat cardiac cath"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a chief complaint of sudden onset shortness of breath on Saturday night. She was found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and taken to the catheterization laboratory. The coronary angiography revealed a 90% mid-left anterior descending (LAD) disease and 60% stenosis in the mid-right coronary artery (RCA).

The patient has been experiencing worsening dyspnea on exertion and is now experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF), as indicated by elevated left and right-sided filling pressures. No intervention has been performed so far.

The patient is currently receiving several medications, including metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), and lisinopril. The dosages and timings of these medications are mentioned in the note.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 mmHg to 136/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, regular rhythm, scattered wheezes in the lungs, morbid obesity, and 4+ nonpitting edema of lower extremities"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female who presented with sudden onset shortness of breath on Saturday night. She was found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed 90% mid-left anterior descending (LAD) disease and 60% stenosis in the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's condition is currently stable with no chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or dizziness. She is being managed with medications such as metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), atorvastatin, aspirin, and clopidogrel. The patient also has a history of asthma, recent cataract surgery, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction of 20-25%. This puts her at risk for heart failure.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient was initially in atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm. There is a risk of arrhythmias due to the underlying heart condition.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and her underlying heart condition. Prophylaxis with heparin is being given.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient has intermittent wheezing on examination,"

","The patient is a 72-year-old female who presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath on Saturday night, worsening dyspnea on exertion, and was found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday, which showed 90% mid-left anterior descending (LAD) disease and 60% stenosis of the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). However, the vessels were tortuous and not amenable to intervention.

The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock with pulmonary edema and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with an estimated ejection fraction of 20-25%. Right ventricular function is also compromised, with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall and moderate mitral regurgitation. She has been started on dopamine, heparin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

The patient's rhythm has changed from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. She has a history of asthma, for which she is being given albuterol nebs as needed and may consider a standing order for q6 nebs. She also has a recent history of cataract surgery, for which she is to continue home ciprofloxacin, prednisolone, and acular eye drops.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of sudden onset shortness of breath and worsening dyspnea on exertion. She was found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 90% stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) and 60% stenosis in the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient also has severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock due to severe LV systolic dysfunction and reduced cardiac output. Close monitoring and management of hemodynamics are crucial.

2. Heart Failure: The patient's LV dysfunction indicates ongoing heart failure. Diuretics have been initiated to manage fluid overload, and further optimization of heart failure medications such as metoprolol and lisinopril will be important.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient was initially in atrial fibrillation and is now in sinus rhythm. Continued monitoring and management of rhythm disturbances are necessary.

4. Respiratory Complications: The patient has significant wheezing on examination, indicating possible asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adequate oxygenation should be maintained, and bronchodilators may be required.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a chief complaint of sudden onset of shortness of breath on Saturday night, worsening dyspnea on exertion, and was found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday, which showed 90% mid-left anterior descending (LAD) disease and 60% stenosis in the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's left-sided filling pressures are elevated. No intervention was performed due to tortuous vessels. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for heart failure and shock. She is on diuretics, dopamine if hypotensive, and anticoagulation therapy with heparin and coumadin. Metoprolol has been started, and lisinopril has been added. The patient also has a history of asthma and recently underwent cataract surgery. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings include distant heart sounds, regular rhythm, scattered wheezes in the lungs, 4+ nonpitting edema in both lower extremities, and diminished pulses in the distal portions of both lower extremities."
